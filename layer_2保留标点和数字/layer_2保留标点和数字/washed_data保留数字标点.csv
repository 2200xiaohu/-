0	实体经济	A Refined Supervision Model of Rice Supply Chain Based on Multi-Blockchain	With the development of Agriculture 4.0, the requirements for sustainable agriculture and precision agriculture continue to grow. As one of the three major staple foods globally, the quality and safety of rice affect human health as well as social development. To ensure the quality and safety of rice and reduce the flow of problematic rice, a multi-layer blockchain-based rice supply chain refinement supervision model MBRRSM (Multi-blockchain Rice Refined Supervision Model) is proposed from the information level. First, the characteristics of information flow in the rice supply chain are analyzed, and a classification table of key information is constructed. Second, the MBRRSM framework is designed. Based on a multi-party hybrid encryption algorithm, secure multi-party computing algorithm, multi-mode storage mechanism, and SPOP (Supervision Proof of Peers) consensus algorithm, a set of mechanisms is designed for the transmission, use, storage, and consensus of rice data in MBRRSM. Subsequently, the security and performance capabilities of MBRRSM are analyzed. Meanwhile, the SPOP consensus algorithm is analyzed. Finally, a prototype system is built based on MBRRSM and verified through exemplary scenarios in different usage situations. The results show that research on the refined supervision of the rice supply chain based on multi-blockchain can finely supervise all types of data in the rice supply chain, and provide a guarantee for enterprise users to safely transmit and use data with different privacy levels. This study presents a unique research paradigm that introduces the theories and methods of the new information field generation into the field of agricultural research, and thus assists in the strategy implementation of "holding grain in the land and storing grain in technology".	precision agriculture;rice supply chain;refined supervision;multi-blockchain;agricultural products;food safetysystem;architecture;performance;internet
1	协同技术	High-Quality Model Aggregation for Blockchain-Based Federated Learning via Reputation-Motivated Task Participation	Federated learning is an emerging paradigm to conduct the machine learning collaboratively but avoid the leakage of original data. Then, how to motivate the data owners to participate federated learning and contribute high-quality data is the crucial issue. In this article, a blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) with a reputation mechanism for high-quality model aggregation is proposed. Specifically, the blockchain transforms the federated learning into a decentralized and trustworthy manner. Over the blockchain, federated learning tasks, undertaken by smart contracts, can be conducted transparently and fairly. Besides, a reputation-constrained data contribution and reward allocation mechanism is designed to encourage data owners to participate in BFL and contribute high-quality data. The noncooperative game is adopted to analyze the behavior strategies of data owners. The existence of the unique equilibrium is proved and the equilibrium point indicates that the data owners can acquire highest reward with the contribution of the highest quality data. Thus, the model quality of BFL is guaranteed. Finally, simulations on the public data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate that BFL with a reputation mechanism can well promote the high-quality model aggregation of federated learning as well as can prevent malicious nodes from corrupting the training task.	collaborative work;data models;task analysis;blockchains;training;computational modeling;smart contracts;blockchain;federated learning;high-quality model;reputation mechanism;smart contractinternet;secure
2	协同技术	Customizable Encryption Algorithms to Manage Data Assets Based on Blockchain Technology in Smart City	The adoption of blockchain technology can provide data asset management's high security, privacy, and traceability. After a comprehensive investigation of the present blockchain-based data asset management mechanism, it was determined that it is only relevant to a portion of the blockchain system design. To address this issue, a new model of data asset management based on blockchain technology is being developed, which incorporates applications at all levels of the blockchain system. This model implements a network layer node authority control mechanism, a consensus layer consensus mechanism with customizable attributes, improved data query efficiency at the data layer by optimizing the structure and building indexes, intelligent data management, and smart contract layer management. Furthermore, at the transaction layer, sharing information encryption using customizable encryption algorithms is introduced. The experimental results reveal that, when compared to the traditional paradigm, the new blockchain-based data asset management strategy enhances the efficiency of on-chain data queries by 2.33 times.	
3	核心技术	Improved Method of Blockchain Cross-Chain Consensus Algorithm Based on Weighted PBFT	Aiming to solve the problems of low fault tolerance, low throughput, and high delay in traditional methods, an improved method of the blockchain cross-chain consensus algorithm based on weighted PBFT is proposed. This article constructs a blockchain cross-chain exchange model based on cluster centers and divides the nodes in the blockchain system into consensus service nodes, cross-chain exchange nodes, and application nodes to improve the performance of consensus computing services. On this basis, according to the weighted PBFT consensus mechanism, the blockchain consensus environment is set up, and the distribution of nodes in the consensus domain and the blockchain signature scheme are obtained. Therefore, the blockchain cross-chain consensus optimization algorithm is designed to reduce throughput and delay and optimize the consensus effect. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the shortcomings of traditional methods, with high throughput and low latency, and strong security. It shows that it is a low resource consumption and secure consensus method.	
4	核心技术	EDALoCo: Enhancing the accessibility of blockchains through a low-code approach to the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management	Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology based on a distributed, secure and immutable ledger that facilitates the registration of transactions and the traceability of tangible and intangible assets without requiring central governance. The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts.	low -code;smart contract;blockchain;event -driven applicationsecurity
5	核心技术	Super-optimization of Smart Contracts	Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain. They are executed for a monetary fee paid in gas-a clear optimization target for smart contract compilers. Because smart contracts are a young, fast-moving field without (manually) fine-tuned compilers, they highly benefit from automated and adaptable approaches, especially as smart contracts are effectively immutable, and as such need a high level of assurance. This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds-by means of an efficient SMT encoding-basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one. We implemented our framework in the tool syrup 2.0. Through large-scale experiments on real-world smart contracts, we analyze performance improvements for different SMT encodings, as well as tradeoffs between quality of optimizations and required optimization time.	smart contracts;synthesis;optimization;max-smt solvers

7	实体经济	Secure decentralized electronic health records sharing system based on blockchains	Blockchain technology has a great potential for improving efficiency, security and privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing systems. However, existing solutions relying on a centralized database are susceptible to traditional security problems such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and a single point of failure similar to traditional database systems. In addition, past solutions exposed users to privacy linking attacks and did not tackle performance and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a permissioned Blockchain based healthcare data sharing system that integrates Blockchain technology, decentralized file system and threshold signature to address the aforementioned problems. The proposed system is based on Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm and Interplanetary File System (IPFS). We implemented the proposed system on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain known as Hyperledger Besu. We evaluated and compared the performance of the proposed system based on various performance metrics such as transaction latency, throughput and failure rate. Experiments were conducted on a variable network size and number of transactions. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than existing Blockchain based systems. Moreover, the decentralized file system provides better security than existing traditional centralized database systems while providing the same level of performance.(c) 2021 The Authors.

8	协同技术	HBFL: A hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework for collaborative IoT intrusion detection	The continuous strengthening of the security posture of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems is vital due to the increasing number of interconnected devices and the volume of sensitive data shared. Using Machine Learning (ML) capabilities to defend against IoT cyber attacks has many potential benefits. However, the currently proposed frameworks do not consider data privacy, secure architectures, and scalable deployments of IoT ecosystems. This paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain-based federated learning framework to enable secure and privacy -preserved collaborative IoT intrusion detection. We highlight and demonstrate the importance of sharing cyber threat intelligence among inter-organisational IoT networks to improve the model's detection capabilities. The proposed ML-based intrusion detection framework follows a hierarchical federated learning architecture to ensure the privacy of the learning process and organisational data. The transactions (model updates) and processes will run on a secure blockchain, and the smart contract will verify the conformance of executed tasks. We have tested our solution and demonstrated its feasibility by implementing it and evaluating the intrusion detection performance using a key IoT data set. The outcome is a securely designed ML-based intrusion detection system capable of detecting a wide range of malicious activities while preserving data privacy.	blockchain;cyber threat intelligence;hierarchical federated learning;iot intrusion detection;smart contractsmart contracts;challenges;internet;things;security
9	市场治理	The Microeconomics of Cryptocurrenciest	Since its launch in 2009 much has been written about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains. While the discussions initially took place mostly on blogs and other popular media, we now are witnessing the emergence of a growing body of rigorous academic research on these topics. By the nature of the phenomenon analyzed, this research spans many academic disciplines including macroeconomics, law and eco-nomics, and computer science. This survey focuses on the microeconomics of crypto-currencies themselves. What drives their supply, demand, trading price, and compe-tition amongst them? This literature has been emerging over the past decade and the purpose of this paper is to summarize its main findings so as to establish a base upon which future research can be conducted.

10	市场治理	Twitter Attribute Classification With Q-Learning on Bitcoin Price Prediction	Bitcoin price prediction based on people's opinions on Twitter usually requires millions of tweets, using different text mining techniques, and developing a machine learning model to perform the prediction. These attempts lead to the employment of a significant amount of computer power, central processing unit (CPU) utilization, random-access memory (RAM) usage, and time. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider a classification of tweet attributes that effects on price changes and computer resource usage levels while obtaining an accurate price prediction. To classify tweet attributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all Bitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four categories based on the following tweet attributes: (i) the number of followers of the tweet poster, (ii) the number of comments on the tweet, (iii) the number of likes, and (iv) the number of retweets. We separately train and test by using the Q-learning model with the above four categorized sets of tweets and find the best accurate prediction among them. We compare our approach with a classic approach where all Bitcoin-related tweets are used as input data for the model, by analyzing the CPU workloads, RAM usage, memory, time, and prediction accuracy. The results show that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most influence on a future price, and their utilization leads to spending 80% less time, 88.8% less CPU consumption, and 12.5% more accurate predictions compared with the classic approach.	bitcoin price prediction;q-learning;reinforcement learning;tweet attributes;twitter sentiment analysis
11	实体经济	SmartAuction: A blockchain-based secure implementation of private data queries	A data marketplace provides a platform for data trading by bringing together data owners and data consumers with a data broker. Recent advancements in mechanism design of data marketplaces have introduced a number of private data query mechanisms that facilitate the trading of private data. A critical assumption to ensuring that these mechanisms function as intended in a real-world online platform, which is often overlooked in the mechanism design literature, is that they are implemented in a network infrastructure that guarantees secure and fair trade. Such a network infrastructure should allow data storage, communications and transactions to satisfy confidentiality, data integrity, fair brokerage, and privacy requirements. In this paper, we propose Smart Auction, the first blockchain-based secure implementation of a private data query system. Smart Auction utilises a public-key encryption scheme, a digital signature scheme and two smart contracts to facilitate the four tasks of a data trade: data submission, data request, auction and query, and payment and delivery. Using universal composability (UC) framework, we verify that Smart Auction satisfies the desirable properties mentioned above. We also conduct experiment to show that Smart Auction can be implemented in real Ethereum platforms and it has a broad applicability.

12	元分析	Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts in Decentralized Governance Systems	The aim of our systematic review was to inspect the recently published literature on decentralized governance systems and integrate the insights it articulates on blockchain technology and smart contracts by employing Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Throughout January and May 2022, a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases was carried out, with search terms including "city" + "blockchain technology", "smart contracts", and "decentralized governance systems". As the analyzed research studies were published between 2016 and 2022, only 371 sources satisfied the eligibility criteria. A Shiny app was harnessed for the PRISMA flow diagram to include evidence-based acquired and handled data. Analyzing the most recent and relevant sources and leveraging screening and quality assessment tools such as AMSTAR, Dedoose, Distiller SR, ROBIS, and SRDR, we integrated the core outcomes and robust correlations related to smart urban governance. As data visualization tools, for initial bibliometric mapping dimensions were harnessed, together with layout algorithms provided by VOSviewer. Future research should investigate smart contract governance of blockchain applications and infrastructure using decision-making tools and spatial cognition algorithms.	blockchain technology;smart contract;decentralized governance system;urban sensing technology;smart city analyticsrevolution 4.0;framework;city;challenges;economy;chain
13	实体经济	BCsRNG: A Secure Random Number Generator Based on Blockchain	Random numbers are widely used in numerical computing, statistical simulation, random sampling, etc. At present, the mechanism for generating random numbers by computers is at risk of being attacked. The generated random numbers may be predicted in some cases,. However, current RNGs used in blockchain are not sufficient enough to handle attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the security of random numbers. This paper improves the random number generator and designs a secure random number generator based on blockchain (BCsRNG). In practice, an encapsulated function algorithm of the secure random number is developed with the smart contract. Moreover, an API is provided to facilitate input and output. The experimental results show that the random numbers generated by BCsRNG are difficult to decipher and have higher randomness and security.	random number;blockchain;smart contract;security;random number generatortechnology

15	核心技术	Smart-Contract-Based Automation for OF-RAN Processes: A Federated Learning Use-Case	The opportunistic fog radio access network (OF-RAN) expands its offloading computation capacity on-demand by establishing virtual fog access points (v-FAPs), comprising user devices with idle resources recruited opportunistically to execute the offloaded tasks in a distributed manner. OF-RAN is attractive for providing computation offloading services to resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices from vertical industrial applications such as smart transportation, tourism, mobile healthcare, and public safety. However, the current OF-RAN design is lacking a trusted and distributed mechanism for automating its processes such as v-FAP formation and service execution. Motivated by the recent emergence of blockchain, with smart contracts as an enabler of trusted and distributed systems, we propose an automated mechanism for OF-RAN processes using smart contracts. To demonstrate how our smart-contract-based automation for OF-RAN could apply in real life, a federated deep learning (DL) use-case where a resource-limited client offloads the resource-intensive training of its DL model to a v-FAP is implemented and evaluated. The results validate the DL and blockchain performances of the proposed smart-contract-enabled OF-RAN. The appropriate setting of process parameters to meet the often competing requirements is also demonstrated.	smart contract;automation;opportunistic fog radio access network;industrial internet-of-things;federated deep learning;blockchain;computation offloadingradio access networks
16	实体经济	Security Enhancement in Smart Logistics with Blockchain Technology: A Home Delivery Use Case	Home delivery (B2C) experienced rapid growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially food delivery. Nonrepudiation is a problem in security and affects delivery. Blockchain technology is a new technology that addresses this issue. This paper proposes preventing nonrepudiation in home delivery through blockchain technology. We also design a data structure and smart contract for distributed application. In addition, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in terms of transaction fees and response times. We experimented on the blockchain emulator, stored data in RDBMS, and implemented a client with a mobile application. The data in the smart contract were directly impacted by the gas used and the response time. Primarily, the function processes the large data size and involves high transaction fees and long response times. The gas used accounts for 9061 times of data length, while the response time accounts for 2.84 times of data length. Finally, we propose a security policy for the proposed framework.	blockchain application;home delivery;smart contract;logistics
17	核心技术	Embedding Smart Contract in Blockchain Transactions to Improve Flexibility for the IoT	In recent years, the blockchain technology has been widely used in the Internet of Things (IoT). One of the major concerns is how to adopt a smart contract to process data from IoT devices flexibly. While plenty of smart contract-based methods can be used, smart contracts are required to be deployed previously. This requires an additional step (to deploy a smart contract) and makes a smart contract separate from its data (transactions to trigger its interface), which generates limitations in IoT scenarios. In this article, we developed an approach to embed the smart contract and its data into the same transaction, eliminating the need for a predeployment step. Data is employed as parameters to invoke the interface of a smart contract, and the smart contract is used to process the data inside the transaction. With this method, a smart contract does not need other transactions from the user. Results indicate that the proposed method can eliminate the requirement of a separately deployed smart contract, saving costs, and waiting time for the predeployment.	smart contracts;internet of things;codes;object oriented modeling;costs;blockchains;virtual machining;embedded smart contract;internet of things (iot);predeployment;smart contractinternet;things
18	核心技术	SmartVM: A Smart Contract Virtual Machine for Fast On-Chain DNN Computations	Blockchain-based artificial intelligence (BC-AI) has been applied for protecting deep neural network (DNN) data from being tampered with, which is expected to further boost trusted distributed AI applications in many fields. However, due to smart contract execution environment architectural defects, it is challenging for previous BC-AI systems to support computing-intensive tasks on-chain performing such as DNN convolution operations. They have to offload computations and a large amount of data from blockchain to off-chain platforms to execute smart contracts as native code. This failure to take advantage of data locality has become one of the major critical performance bottlenecks in BC-AI system. To this end, in this article, we propose SmartVM with optimization methods to support on-chain DNN inference for BC-AI system. The key idea is to design and optimize the computing mechanism and storage structure of smart contract execution environment according to the characteristics of DNN such as high computational parallelism and large data volume. We decompose SmartVM into three components: 1) a compact DNN-oriented instruction set to describe computations in a short number of instructions to reduce interpretation time. 2) a memory management mechanism to make SmartVM memory dynamic free/allocated according to the size of DNN feature maps. 3) a block-based weight prefetching and parallel computing method to organize each layer's computing and weights prefetching in a pipelined manner. We perform the typical image classification in a private Ethereum blockchain testbed to evaluate SmartVM performance. Experimental results highlight that SmartVM can support DNN inference on-chain with roughly the same efficiency against the native code execution. Compared with the traditional off-chain computing, SmartVM can speed up the overall execution by 70x, 16x, 11x, and 12x over LeNet5, AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNet, respectively. The memory footprint can be reduced by 84%, 90.8%, 94.3%, and 93.7% over the above four models, while offering the same level model accuracy. This article sheds light on the design space of the smart contract virtual machine for DNN computation and is promising to further boost BC-AI applications.	smart contracts;blockchains;virtual machining;convolutional neural networks;convolution;task analysis;random access memory;deep neural network;smart contract;virtual machine;architectural support technologyblockchain;framework;time

This study analyzes how the fintech sector reacts to central bank digital currency (CBDC) signals released by central banks. First, we innovatively construct a signal index for the CBDC. Second, by collecting data from January 2012 to February 2022, the positively time-varying response of the fintech sector to the CBDC signals is found. Meanwhile, the response intensity reduces over time, thereby reflecting the weakening sensibility of the fintech sector to the CBDC signals. Third, shocks of symbolic events regarding the CBDC in the fintech sector are captured to further confirm the response to signals.	fintech;central bank digital currency;capital market;impulse response;tvp-var
22	市场治理	Investigating the Co-Volatility Spillover Effects between Cryptocurrencies and Currencies at Different Natures of Risk Events	This paper examines and confirms the varying volatility of the relationship between cryptocurrency and currency markets at different time periods, such as when the market encountered multiple risk events including the US-China trade war, COVID-19, and the Russian-Ukraine war. We employ the Diagonal BEKK model and find that the co-volatility spillover effects between the returns of cryptocurrencies and currencies, with the exception of Tether and the U.S. dollar index, evolved significantly. Furthermore, the co-volatility spillover effects between cryptocurrencies and EUR have the largest effects and fluctuations. Large-cap cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin and Ethereum) have greater co-volatility spillover effects between them and currencies. Regarding the ability of cryptocurrencies to act as safe-haven for currencies, we observe that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether served as safe-havens during the US-China trade war, and Bitcoin was a safe-haven during COVID-19. During the 2022 Russian-Ukraine war, Bitcoin and Tether were safe-havens. Interestingly, our findings point out that Bitcoin provides a more consistent safe-haven function for currency markets. Overall, by including multiple global risk events and a comprehensive dataset, the results support our conjecture (and earlier studies) indicating that the capabilities of cryptocurrency are time-varying and related to market status and risk events with different natures.	co-volatility spillover effects;cryptocurrency;diagonal bekk model;exchange rates;global uncertaintysafe-haven;time-series;unit-root;bitcoin;hedge;gold;investment;dollar

A Markov-Switching Vector AutoRegression model is considered to further explore the dynamic relationships between cryptocurrencies and other financial assets. We estimate the presence of volatility clustering, a rapid decay of the autocorrelation function, an excess of kurtosis and multivariate little cross-correlation across the series, except for contemporaneous returns. The analysis covers the pandemic period and sheds lights on the behaviour of cryptocurrencies under unexpected extreme events.	volatility clustering;daily returns series;hidden markov models;cryptocurrency markethidden markov-models;financial time-series;safe-haven;bitcoin;volatility;maximization;persistence
24	市场治理	Cryptocurrencies Intraday High-Frequency Volatility Spillover Effects Using Univariate and Multivariate GARCH Models	Over the past years, cryptocurrencies have drawn substantial attention from the media while attracting many investors. Since then, cryptocurrency prices have experienced high fluctuations. In this paper, we forecast the high-frequency 1 min volatility of four widely traded cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple, by modeling volatility to select the best model. We propose various generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) family models, including an sGARCH(1,1), GJR-GARCH(1,1), TGARCH(1,1), EGARCH(1,1), which we compare to a multivariate DCC-GARCH(1,1) model to forecast the intraday price volatility. We evaluate the results under the MSE and MAE loss functions. Statistical analyses demonstrate that the univariate GJR-GARCH model (1,1) shows a superior predictive accuracy at all horizons, followed closely by the TGARCH(1,1), which are the best models for modeling the volatility process on out-of-sample data and have more accurately indicated the asymmetric incidence of shocks in the cryptocurrency market. The study determines evidence of bidirectional shock transmission effects between the cryptocurrency pairs. Hence, the multivariate DCC-GARCH model can identify the cryptocurrency market's cross-market volatility shocks and volatility transmissions. In addition, we introduce a comparison of the models using the improvement rate (IR) metric for comparing models. As a result, we compare the different forecasting models to the chosen benchmarking model to confirm the improvement trends for the model's predictions.	intraday volatility;bitcoin price forecasting;cryptocurrency;garch models;gjr-garch model;volatility forecasting;egarch model;tgarch model;dcc-garch model;ethereum;litecoin;rippleconditional heteroskedasticity;time-series;bitcoin;return
25	市场治理	Optimal Portfolios of National Currencies, Commodities and Fuel, Agricultural Commodities and Cryptocurrencies during the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict	This study sets out to explore the impacts of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on worldwide financial markets by considering a large array of national currencies, precious metals and fuel, agricultural commodities and cryptocurrencies. Estimations span the period since the Russian invasion until the takeover of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Optimal portfolios are constructed for separate categories of financial assets for different levels of risk-aversion by investors. The Chinese yuan, gold, corn, soybeans, sugar and Bitcoin prove to be safe haven investments while the Japanese yen, natural gas, wheat and the combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum offer profit opportunities for risk-seekers. Notably, the agricultural commodities' portfolio is the best performing while the cryptocurrency portfolio generates the worst risk-return trade-off. National currencies could act as safe havens in the place of gold when all types of assets can be combined. Natural gas is revealed to be the most reliable profit generator. Overall, high risk appetite does not result in large improvement in portfolios' returns. This study sheds light on investors' optimal decision-making during elevated geopolitical uncertainties and provides a compass for improving welfare.	optimal portfolio;national currencies;commodities;cryptocurrencies;risk appetite;russian-ukrainian conflictgeopolitical risks;sharpe ratio;asset;bitcoin
26	市场治理	Herding behavior in conventional cryptocurrency market, non-fungible tokens, and DeFi assets	We examine the static and time-varying herding behavior in three cryptocurrency classes: 'con-ventional' cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens, and DeFi assets during the most recent cryp-tocurrency bubble of 2021. While static herding analysis failed to demonstrate any evidence of herding, the time-varying herding has been identified in conventional cryptocurrencies and DeFi assets for the short investment horizons. The herding asymmetry analysis reveals that herding is not evident in conventional cryptocurrencies and NFT during up/down market, high/low vola-tility days, and high/low trading days. We only find herding in DeFi assets during the low volatility days.	nft herding;cryptocurrencies;non -fungible tokens;defi assets;cryptocurrency bubble
27	市场治理	Volatility spillovers across NFTs news attention and financial markets	The aim of this study is to investigate the volatility spillover connectedness between NFTs attention and financial markets. This paper firstly proposes a new direct proxy for the public's attention in the NFT market: the non-fungible tokens attention index (NFTsAI), based on 590m news stories from the LexisNexis News & Business database and applies the historical decomposition to assess the historical variations of the NFTsAI. Then the empirical analysis is performed via a TVP-VAR volatility spillover connectedness model. The empirical results show that NFTsAI indicates NFT markets are dominated by cryptocurrency, DeFi, equity, bond, commodity, F.X. and gold markets. And NFT markets are volatility spillover receivers. In addition, NFT assets could impede financial contagion and have significant diversification benefits. Employing a panel pooled OLS regression model as a supplementary analysis and a GARCH-MIDAS model as a robustness test. This study reveals that NFTsAI has sufficient power to explain the return of NFT assets from a fixed effect perspective, and NFTsAI contains useful forecasting information for both short and long-term volatility of NFT markets, separately.

Consequently, IoT technology has improved productivity in many sectors, and smart farming has also hugely benefited from the IoT. Smart farming enables precision agriculture, high crop yield, and the efficient utilization of natural resources to sustain for a longer time. Smart farming includes sensing capabilities, communication technologies to transmit the collected data from the sensors, and data analytics to extract meaningful information from the collected data. These modules will enable farmers to make intelligent decisions and gain profits. However, incorporating new technologies includes inheriting security and privacy consequences if they are not implemented in a secure manner, and smart farming is not an exception. Therefore, security monitoring is an essential component to be implemented for smart farming. In this paper, we propose a cloud-enabled smart-farm security monitoring framework to monitor device status and sensor anomalies effectively and mitigate security attacks using behavioral patterns. Additionally, a blockchain-based smart-contract application was implemented to securely store security-anomaly information and proactively mitigate similar attacks targeting other farms in the community. We implemented the security-monitoring-framework prototype for smart farms using Arduino Sensor Kit, ESP32, AWS cloud, and the smart contract on the Ethereum Rinkeby Test Network and evaluated network latency to monitor and respond to security events. The performance evaluation of the proposed framework showed that our solution could detect security anomalies within real-time processing time and update the other farm nodes to be aware of the situation.	smart contract;aws cloud;blockchain;iot security;smart agriculture;security;sensor monitoringiot applications;privacy
29	核心技术	On the Latency Performance in Private Blockchain Networks	Blockchain technologies have been emerging with the potential to disrupt many fields (e.g., cryptocurrencies replacing the traditional ones, enabling trustworthy voting, etc.). The Internet of Things (IoT) has been predictably strengthened when integrating to the private blockchain, such as Ethereum. In an IoT deployment with private Ethereum, a thorough understanding of the latency is a critical issue that has not been adequately understood in the literature. Motivated by that, this work aims to comprehend the latency performance in the IoT Ethereum with two popular consensus algorithms: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Authority (PoA). Initially, we clarify different latency segments from transaction submission to execution, namely, the transaction lifecycle in a private blockchain. We then consider the three related latency metrics: 1) transaction-oriented latency; 2) mining time; and 3) block-oriented latency in the PoW case. With PoA, the mining time's consideration is omitted since the mining process is not necessary. After that, we construct a realistic private Ethereum IoT network (i.e., using a laptop and seven Raspberry Pi 3b+ nodes) and a large-scale emulated one with 30 nodes. We write and deploy a smart contract to read and write data to the blockchain and measure the latencies in various scenarios. The measurement results reveal the values of transaction-oriented and block-oriented latency with PoW and PoA in both the actual and emulated networks. Moreover, we derive the expected value for the PoW's mining time by fitting the probabilities to an exponential curve.	blockchains;internet of things;measurement;peer-to-peer computing;smart contracts;delays;smart homes;ethereum;latency;private blockchain;proof of authority (poa);proof of work (pow)iot;internet;architecture
30	实体经济	Generalized Ethereum Blockchain-based recommender system framework	This study presents a new generalized recommender system framework based on Blockchain technology called BC-Rec. Blockchain technology is a decentralized data-sharing ledger across a large network of untrusted entities. The presented idea is motivated by the fact that e-business platforms share common data about users, items, and sellers. In other words, a new user/seller in a particular e-business platform may be a trusted user/seller in other e-business platforms. Also, a new item in a particular marketplace may have a historical record in other marketplaces. The core idea behind BC-Rec is to adopt Blockchain technology to share the data required to generate the recommendation between the e-business platforms. BC-Rec architecture is designed based on a permission-less public Blockchain network, Ethereum Blockchain. The key feature of BC-Rec is the smart contract deployed to determine the agreement between certain entities on the Blockchain. We expect that the proposed framework will help alleviate cold-start, sparsity, and shilling attack problems. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

31	虚拟经济	HYBRID APPROACH OF QUICK RESPONSE CODE AND NON-FUNGIBLE TOKEN IN PRIVATE PERMISSIONED BLOCKCHAIN FOR ANTI-COUNTERFEITING	Counterfeit goods have challenged the government, business owners, and in-tellectual property holders, and the establishment of blockchain allowed the creation of digital assets of the physical good stored and distributed securely among participants to answer the problem. The non-fungible token (NFT) combined with a quick response code (QR code) is resourceful in digitally and physically identifying and verifying the physical goods' origin and authenticity. This study further explores the potential of the private permissioned blockchain in creating, storing, and managing the digital assets representa-tion of the physical goods in the form of NFTs on a semi-decentralized application (DApp) named Oricon. This hybrid approach is a new way for low-cost anti-counterfeiting aimed at various physical goods. Test and evaluation show that the latency of the Oricon is 1.028s, and the throughput is 18.2 transactions per second (TPS). The parallel process-ing of transactions gives higher throughput with 20.454 TPS and a latency of 1.169s. This work shows that with its proven performance and scalability characteristics, Oricon is a promising solution for further deployment and anti-counterfeiting in various indus-tries.	anti-counterfeiting;digital asset;nft;permissioned blockchain;qr code;semi-decentralized application

What has happened and changed during the past decade? A brief reflection and review are presented here with a focus on digital twins in CPS versus parallel intelligence in CPSS, and their relationship to blockchain intelligence, smart contracts, metaverses, DAO, Web3, and decentralized science. The concept of DeMetaverses is thus introduced and interpreted as a DAO-based decentralized autonomous metaverse. The characteristics, mechanism, and impact of DeMetaverses are discussed with a vision for achieving an integrated human, artificial, natural, and organizational intelligence that would transform our world into "6S" societies.	systems

These worries are made worse because businesses are beginning to construct their own Big Data-based Data Middle Platform. The research team has summarized the security and privacy protection issues of Big Data-based Data Middle Platform by combining previous research and providing a table that lists some contributions that the blockchain uses for security and privacy protection in Big Data. A general Data Middle Platform architecture is also be given in the Methodology section. Based on this architecture, the team unveiled blockchain-based security and privacy protection framework on the Data Middle Platform in this study. This approach emphasizes mitigating the security and privacy issues posed by sensitive data entering the Data Middle Platform and data published by the Data Middle Platform. Following that, the researchers developed a testing system based on this framework to determine whether or not the framework was both feasible and practicable. The trials revealed that the framework is applicable, even though it requires further development and refinement.	
34	市场治理	The Dynamics of Governing Enterprise Blockchain Ecosystems	The aim of this paper is to analyze how the governance of an enterprise blockchain ecosystem changes as it matures and increases in size. A review of the literature serves to identify five behavioral drivers of governance, which appear to affect the long-term viability of a blockchain ecosystem: access rights, decision rights, incentives, accountability, and conflict resolution. We subsequently report the findings from a comparative case study of how three large blockchain ecosystems implemented various governance mechanisms to exploit and modify the five behavioral drivers over time. Based on twenty-six interviews and approximately 200 h of participant observations, we propose an analytical framework that consists of three distinctive stages in the life cycle of a blockchain ecosystem. Each stage is characterized by an intricate relationship between off-chain and on-chain governance mechanisms. Based on these findings, various recommendations are provided to increase the long-term viability of blockchain ecosystems.	blockchain;governance;dynamics;ecosystems;case study;behavioral drivers;consensus mechanismstechnology;governance;framework;consensus

Results: This study identifies People, Organisation, Technology, Industry and Country (POTIC) as factors important in influencing blockchain technology adoption in South Africa. The study expands and contributes to traditional frameworks for adopting blockchain technology in the South African clearing and settlement industry by adding five factors: trust, load shedding, unemployment/layoffs, current infrastructure, useful life and educational campaigns. Conclusion: The POTIC framework will be beneficial to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and Shares Transactions Totally Electronic (STRATE) when considering the adoption of blockchain technology for the integration of trade, execution and post-trade services to reduce the settlement cycle. In addition, when regulators need to formulate new regulations they will benefit from considering the POTIC framework.	blockchain;clearing and settlement;south africa;strate;csd;equities;capital markets;jsetechnology;markets;automation
36	协同技术	A Classification-Based Blockchain Architecture for Smart Home with Hierarchical PoW Mechanism	Smart home, as a typical Internet of Things (IoT) application, provides people with a variety of conveniences. Unfortunately, it may suffer from security and privacy issues. Currently, blockchain theory is considered as one of the potential solutions to the IoT security problem. However, according to the rules of blockchain, it requires large storage to store distributed ledgers and undertakes long latency caused by proof of work (PoW), which cannot be performed by resource-constrained IoT devices. To address the issue, we propose a classification-based blockchain architecture with a hierarchical PoW mechanism, which can reduce the storage consumption and decrease the latency. In our architecture, we divide IoT devices into several child nodes by data classification and convert the data storage into partial network storage. Furthermore, we try to set the moderate-cost security grades (SG) to adjust the difficulty of PoW for reduction of latency. Finally, comparing the performance of our scheme with the traditional method and current technology, the proposed architecture not only takes up less storage (i.e., almost 90% reduction) but also increases efficiency (i.e., almost 50% running time saving) while ensuring safety.	smart home;secure architecture;blockchain;storage efficiency;iotsecurity;challenges;internet;city
37	实体经济	Exploring Coupled Open Innovation for Digital Servitization in Grocery Retail: From Digital Dynamic Capabilities Perspective	Open innovation and digital servitization have been hot topics in existing research. Moreover, the latest research in entrepreneurship and general management justifies that the performance results of specific innovation strategies are usually influenced by dynamic capabilities. However, there is little empirical research on the linkage of open innovation, digital servitization, and micro-foundations of digital dynamic capabilities that affect alliance performance. The emerging literature on open innovation provides partial insight into the micro-foundations of digital dynamic capabilities. Based on it, from a dynamic capability perspective, this paper constructs a conceptual model of research including coupled open innovation of collaborative partners, alliance's formation phases, and dynamic digital capabilities and their micro-foundations which impact alliance performance in grocery retail. The paper aims to provide an overarching view of the digital servitization process of grocery retailers and unpack the micro-foundations of the digital transformation of their business models to sustain advantages. Thus, the paper contributes to the research on open innovation, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and dynamic capabilities and provides two theoretical propositions. Then, having employed two illustrative case studies, this paper empirically tests theoretical propositions and justifies the role of coupled open innovation strategies for digital servitization and its micro-foundations.	open innovation;blockchain;artificial intelligence;dynamic capabilities;digital servitizationmicrofoundations;state
38	实体经济	Off-Road Electric Vehicles and Autonomous Robots in Agricultural Sector: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities	This paper describes the development trends and prospects of green-energy-based off-road electric vehicles and robots in the agricultural sector. Today, the agriculture sector faces several challenges, such as population growth, increasing energy demands, labor shortages, and global warming. Increases in energy demand cause many challenges worldwide; therefore, many methods are suggested to achieve energy independence from fossil fuels and reduce emissions. From a long-term point of view, the electrification of agricultural vehicles and renewable energy sources appear to be an essential step for robotic and smart farming in Agriculture 5.0. The trend of technological growth using fully autonomous robots in the agricultural sector seems to be one of the emerging technologies to tackle the increased demand for food and address environmental issues. The development of electric vehicles, alternative green fuels, and more energy-efficient technologies such as hybrid electric, robotic, and autonomous vehicles is increasing and improving work quality and operator comfort. Furthermore, related digital technologies such as advanced network communication, artificial intelligence techniques, and blockchain are discussed to understand the challenges and opportunities in industry and research.	agricultural autonomous vehicles;digital agriculture;electric tractors;sustainability;hybrid electric powertrain;smart farming;roboticsprecision agriculture;big data;the-art;technologies;systems;security;privacy;driven
39	实体经济	Survey on the Applications of Blockchain in Agriculture	Dating back many millennia, agriculture is an ancient practice in the evolution of civilization. It was developed when humans thought about it and concluded that not everyone in the community was required to produce food. Instead, specialized labor, tools, and techniques could help people achieve surplus food for their community. Since then, agriculture has continuously evolved across the ages and has occupied a vital, synergistic position in the existence of humanity. The evolution of agriculture was based on a compulsion to feed the growing population, and, importantly, maintain the quality and traceability of food, prevent counterfeit products, and modernize and optimize yield. Recent trends and advancements in blockchain technology have some significant attributes that are ideal for agriculture. The invention and implementation of blockchain have caused a fair share of positive disruptions and evolutionary adoption in agriculture to modernize the domain. Blockchain has been adopted at various stages of the agriculture lifecycle for improved evolution. This work presents an intense survey of the literature on how blockchain has positively impacted and continues to influence various market verticals in agriculture, the challenges and the future.	blockchain;blockchain in agriculture;agriculture digitization;information technology in agriculture;agriculture 5.0double-chain architecture;food-supply chain;traceability system;smart agriculture;products;internet;iot;optimization;technologies;performance
40	实体经济	Cyber Threats to Smart Grids: Review, Taxonomy, Potential Solutions, and Future Directions	Smart Grids (SGs) are governed by advanced computing, control technologies, and networking infrastructure. However, compromised cybersecurity of the smart grid not only affects the security of existing energy systems but also directly impacts national security. The increasing number of cyberattacks against the smart grid urgently necessitates more robust security protection technologies to maintain the security of the grid system and its operations. The purpose of this review paper is to provide a thorough understanding of the incumbent cyberattacks' influence on the entire smart grid ecosystem. In this paper, we review the various threats in the smart grid, which have two core domains: the intrinsic vulnerability of the system and the external cyberattacks. Similarly, we analyze the vulnerabilities of all components of the smart grid (hardware, software, and data communication), data management, services and applications, running environment, and evolving and complex smart grids. A structured smart grid architecture and global smart grid cyberattacks with their impact from 2010 to July 2022 are presented. Then, we investigated the the thematic taxonomy of cyberattacks on smart grids to highlight the attack strategies, consequences, and related studies analyzed. In addition, potential cybersecurity solutions to smart grids are explained in the context of the implementation of blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. Finally, technical future directions based on the analysis are provided against cyberattacks on SGs.	smart grids;cybersecurity;vulnerabilities;cyberattacks;blockchain;artificial intelligencedata injection attacks;classification approach;intrusion detection;anomaly detection;power-systems;security;deep;identification;challenges;network
41	实体经济	Decentralizing Electronic Medical Records on the Blockchain Using Smart Contracts	The blockchain technology is considered as the most secure and decentralized way to manage your payments with cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, with the advent of NFT's which are a way to make owning digital art a possibility we can see how blockchain has multiple purposes. Blockchain gained traction because of its attributes such as security, immutability, expandability and decentralism. We can see blockchain being used more and more for non-financial applications. On the topic of electronic medical records which need to be secure and be accessed globally, it is still being stored locally or on the cloud which is confined to an organization or a group of organizations. We can observe that healthcare is a field that can benefit massively from blockchain technology. It can make electronic medical records be securely accessed in case of emergencies using smart contracts making the system effectively be used hand in hand with conventional database systems. Smart contracts can be used to manage the accessibility of electronic medical data by third party organizations globally without the data being tampered, manipulated or misused. The system can be used with the current database as it is interoperable. With the successful implementation of this system, it will give access to patients, health care organizations and other third parties the ability to view and manage the electronic medical data.	blockchain;decentralized;smart contracts;medical recordsdata-transmission
42	实体经济	Scheduling and Securing Drone Charging System Using Particle Swarm Optimization and Blockchain Technology	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a powerful technology for introducing untraditional solutions to many challenges in non-military fields and industrial applications in the next few years. However, the limitations of a drone's battery and the available optimal charging techniques represent a significant challenge in using UAVs on a large scale. This problem means UAVs are unable to fly for a long time; hence, drones' services fail dramatically. Due to this challenge, optimizing the scheduling of drone charging may be an unusual solution to drones' battery problems. Moreover, authenticating drones and verifying their charging transactions with charging stations is an essential associated problem. This paper proposes a scheduling and secure drone charging system in response to these challenges. The proposed system was simulated on a generated dataset consisting of 300 drones and 50 charging station points to evaluate its performance. The optimization of the proposed scheduling methodology was based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and game theory-based auction model. In addition, authenticating and verifying drone charging transactions were executed using a proposed blockchain protocol. The optimization and scheduling results showed the PSO algorithm's efficiency in optimizing drone routes and preventing drone collisions during charging flights with low error rates with an MAE = 0.0017 and an MSE = 0.0159. Moreover, the investigation to authenticate and verify the drone charging transactions showed the efficiency of the proposed blockchain protocol while simulating the proposed system on the Ethereum platform. The obtained results clarified the efficiency of the proposed blockchain protocol in executing drone charging transactions within a short time and low latency within an average of 0.34 s based on blockchain performance metrics. Moreover, the proposed scheduling methodology achieved a 96.8% success rate of drone charging cases, while only 3.2% of drones failed to charge after three scheduling rounds.	blockchain technology;unmanned aerial vehicles (uavs);drone scheduling;drone authentication;particle swarm optimization (pso)truck
43	市场治理	Local Non-Bayes an Social Learning With Stubborn Agents	In this article, we study a social learning model in which agents iteratively update their beliefs about the true state of the world using private signals and the beliefs of other agents in a non-Bayesian manner. Some agents are stubborn, meaning they attempt to convince others of an erroneous true state (modeling fake news). We show that while agents learn the true state on short timescales, they "forget" it and believe the erroneous state to be true on longer timescales. Using these results, we devise strategies for seeding stubborn agents so as to disrupt learning, which outperforms intuitive heuristics and gives novel insights regarding vulnerabilities in social learning.	complex networks;consensus algorithm;social network theoryopinion dynamics;networks
44	协同技术	An Information Ethics Framework Based on ICT Platforms	With continuing developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robot technology, ethical issues related to digital humans, AI avatars, intelligent process automation, robots, cyborgs, and autonomous vehicles are emerging, and the need for cultural and social sustainability through AI ethics is increasing. Moreover, as the use of video conferencing and metaverse platforms has increased due to COVID-19, ethics concepts and boundaries related to information and communications technology, cyber etiquette, AI ethics, and robot ethics have become more ambiguous. Because the definitions of ethics domains may be confusing due to the various types of computing platforms available, this paper attempts to classify these ethics domains according to three main platforms: computing devices, intermediary platforms, and physical computing devices. This classification provides a conceptual ethics framework that encompasses computer ethics, information ethics, cyber ethics, robot ethics, and AI ethics. Several examples are provided to clarify the boundaries between the various ethics and platforms. The results of this study can be the educational basis for the sustainability of society on ethical issues according to the development of technology.	computer ethics;information ethics;cyber ethics;ai ethics;robot ethicscomputer ethics;internet ethics;scale
45	协同技术	Leveraging Explainable AI to Support Cryptocurrency Investors	In the last decade, cryptocurrency trading has attracted the attention of private and professional traders and investors. To forecast the financial markets, algorithmic trading systems based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are becoming more and more established. However, they suffer from the lack of transparency, thus hindering domain experts from directly monitoring the fundamentals behind market movements. This is particularly critical for cryptocurrency investors, because the study of the main factors influencing cryptocurrency prices, including the characteristics of the blockchain infrastructure, is crucial for driving experts' decisions. This paper proposes a new visual analytics tool to support domain experts in the explanation of AI-based cryptocurrency trading systems. To describe the rationale behind AI models, it exploits an established method, namely SHapley Additive exPlanations, which allows experts to identify the most discriminating features and provides them with an interactive and easy-to-use graphical interface. The simulations carried out on 21 cryptocurrencies over a 8-year period demonstrate the usability of the proposed tool.	quantitative trading;cryptocurrencies;blockchain
46	法律治理	The money laundering and terrorist financing risks of new and disruptive technologies: a futures-oriented scoping review	New and disruptive technologies, including cryptocurrencies and new payment methods, are revolutionising the way people engage with finance. Although they provide significant benefits to consumers, they are also inadvertently creating new money laundering and terrorist financing risks. This paper examines the risks that are, or are predicted to be, prevalent in three technology sectors-distributed ledger technologies (including cryptocurrencies), new payment methods and financial technologies (FinTech), through a systematic scoping review process. Specifically, the paper identifies enablers of both crimes, the precise criminal methods they might facilitate, at-risk stakeholders (of exploitation and/or complicity) and risk characteristics. The study involves systematic scoping reviews of the academic and futures literatures as well as a consultation exercise with experts to assess the likely veracity of the findings. In addition to identifying an array of specific risks, we identify six underlying trends that facilitate them. We discuss these, their policy implications, future directions for research and their benefit for conducting risk assessments to assess forthcoming technological developments.	money laundering;terrorist financing;blockchain;cryptocurrencies;new payment methods;fintechcryptocurrency
47	实体经济	Sustainable organizational performance through blockchain technology adoption and knowledge management in China	Global competition encourages all industries to attain cutting-edge performance by continuously developing their goods and processes; knowledge is the most effective and powerful weapon for long-term sustainabil-ity and growth. Effective blockchain adoption (BCA) and better supply chain visibility (SCV) via organiza-tional and production knowledge management (KM) have emerged as the most powerful instruments for improving sustainable organizational performance (SOP). Therefore, drawing on the resource-based view and technology acceptance model, this study seeks to underline the empirical relationships among KM, BCA, SCV, and SOP in a developing country context of Chinese manufacturing, as research in this sector is still nascent encompassing these constructs. Data were collected from 289 respondents (senior, middle, and junior) level staff members from manufacturing industries and analyzed by a novel approach; partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The empirical analyses indicated that KM significantly impacts BCA. BCA also positively affects SCV. Besides BCA, the KM also positively impacts SOP. The mediation effect analysis revealed the significant serial mediating impact of BCA and SCV on the relationship of KM to SOP. This study enriches the inadequate literature and throws light on BCA from an organizational resource perspective. The study deepens our understanding and delivers valued insights to the managers and policy -makers of manufacturing industries concerning the role of KM, BCA, and SCV in achieving SOP.

48	实体经济	Aiming for bullseye: a novel gameplan for circular economy in the construction industry	Purpose The paper aims to provide managerial recommendations for implementing circular economy (CE) principles in both organizational and interorganizational contexts, including when using digital tools, such as building information modeling (BIM) and blockchain. Drawn from the construction sector in the Netherlands, the findings can be generalized to similar sectors where a company may receive multiple inputs as part of its supply chain augmented by digital technologies. Design/methodology/approach Design addresses the research question: what are the strategic and tactical approaches of organizations on the CE pathway? Sub-questions target initiatives pursued by participants, and look toward information, roles and functions for supporting the CE process. Applying a multiple-case study approach (21 semi-structured interviews with 29 participants) the paper explores strategic initiatives of construction companies implementing CE pathways. The strength of the research design comes from facilitation of rich and deep qualitative insights from Netherlands-based managers embedded within global supply chains contributing to conceptual mapping. A limitation is data from one country (though representing both national and multinational companies). Findings Interviewed managers share guidance for production-related construction companies anchored in materials and product design. Recommendations include to (1) develop both internally and externally the awareness of CE amongst leaders, (2) communicate with internal and external stakeholders for shared vision across the supply chain, (3) start with pilot projects, and (4) ensure product data-integration for CE business models through computer modeling and blockchain for decision-making processes, choices of materials, business model coordination and product (re)design. Continuous learning about CE roles and responsibilities amidst organizational process restructuring is required throughout linear to CE transitions. Extending the time for the CE principles evaluation process would allow for reconsideration of decisions made for CE implemented projects. Originality/value A novel CE gameplan with a hurdles and recommendations checklist provides an operational interface with decision making points between internal factors for the host organization and external supply chain partners.	circular economy;construction;gameplan;supply chain;bullseye;the netherlandsreverse logistics;supply chain;management;sustainability;levers;operations;strategy;model;life
49	实体经济	Aperiodic two-layer energy management system for community microgrids based on blockchain strategy to be published in: Applied energy	Regulatory changes in different countries regarding self-consumption and growing public concern about the environment are encouraging the establishment of community microgrids. These community microgrids inte -grate a large number of small-scale distributed energy resources and offers a solution to enhance power system reliability and resilience. This work proposes a geographically-based split of the community microgrids into clusters of members that tend to have similar consumption and generation profiles, mimicking the most typical layout of cities. Assuming a community microgrid divided into clusters, a two-layer architecture is developed to facilitate the greater penetration of distributed energy resources in an efficient way. The first layer, referred as the market layer, is responsible for creating local energy markets with the aim of maximising the economic benefits for community microgrid members. The second layer is responsible for the network reconfiguration, which is based on the energy balance within each cluster. This layer complies with the IEC 61850 communication standard, in order to control commercial sectionalizing and tie switches. This allows the community microgrid network to be reconfigured to minimise energy exchanges with the main grid, without requiring interaction with the distributed system operator. To implement this two-layer energy management strategy, an aperiodic market approach based on Blockchain technology, and the additional functionality offered by Smart Contracts is adopted. This embraces the concept of energy communities since it decentralizes the control and eliminates intermediaries. The use of aperiodic control techniques helps to overcome the challenges of using Blockchain technology in terms of storage, computational requirements and member privacy. The scalability and modularity of the Smart Contract-based system allow each cluster of members to be designed by tailoring the system to their specific needs. The implementation of this strategy is based on low-cost off-the-shelf devices, such as Raspberry Pi 4 Model B boards, which operate as Blockchain nodes of community microgrid members. Finally, the strategy has been validated by emulating two use cases based on the IEEE 123-node system network model highlighting the benefits of the proposal.	community microgrid;energy markets;blockchain;network reconfiguration;microgrids;aperiodic controlreconfiguration algorithm;optimization;architecture;challenges;design;trends
50	实体经济	Distributed Economic Dispatch Control Method with Frequency Regulator for Smart Grid under Time-Varying Directed Topology	The paper studies a new distributed control method to solve the economic dispatch problem (EDP) under directed topology based on consensus protocol. Electrical equipment is closely related to frequency, and the frequency of each generator varies independently during operation. Therefore, it hinders the realization of economic dispatch. To solve the problem, we combine a frequency regulator with a consensus protocol, which eliminates the effect of frequency variation on the designed consensus algorithm. Meanwhile, considering the problem of excessive communication cost and low computational efficiency in large-scale power systems, an event-triggered mechanism is introduced into the designed algorithm. Furthermore, in order to overcome the unexpected loss of communication links, the time-varying topology mechanism is employed to develop the distributed economic dispatch (DED) algorithm to improve the robustness. Then, the stability of the above algorithm is proved by graph theory and convergence analysis. Finally, several simulations illustrate that our proposed methods are effective.	economic dispatch;consensus protocol;frequency regulator;event-triggered;time-varying topologypower-system;algorithm;consensus;microgrids;strategies;management;networks
51	核心技术	Adaptable Cryptographic Primitives in Blockchains via Smart Contracts	Blockchain-based platforms utilise cryptographic protocols to enforce the correct behaviour of users, as well as to guarantee a sufficient level of protection against malicious adversaries. Cryptography is, however, an ever-evolving discipline, and any breakthrough would have immediate consequences on the security of blockchain-based applications. A possible threat currently under investigation is given by the development of quantum computers, since several wide-adopted cryptographic protocols have been proved to be unsafe against quantum-capable adversaries. In this work, we propose a novel approach for the management of cryptographic primitives in smart-contract-based ledgers, discussing how it fits in both a (partially) permissioned and a fully permissionless setting. The cryptographic protocols are managed in a flexible manner via a set of smart-contracts defined on the ledger itself, in this way the choice of algorithms and parameters can change quickly. Among the advantages of this approach, we remark how it allows designing an adaptive post-quantum-based blockchain that keeps up with ongoing technological advances. In general, the introduction of new features and the application of fixes to a blockchain cause forks in the chain, which may cause major disruptions. The use of smart contracts in blockchain management allows to avoid this problem, dynamically introducing new protocols or deprecating old ones without compromising previous data. The Cryptographic Kernel approach has been adopted by Quadrans, an open-source, public, decentralised smart-contract-based blockchain with a specific focus on the needs of industry, complex supply chains, and IOT devices.	blockchain;distributed ledger;smart contracts;post-quantum cryptography;digital signatures
52	核心技术	Multiverse of HawkNess: A Universally-Composable MPC-Based Hawk Variant	The evolution of smart contracts in recent years inspired a crucial question: do smart contract evaluation protocols provide the required level of privacy when executing contracts on the blockchain? The Hawk (IEEE S&P '16) paper introduces a way to solve the problem of privacy in smart contracts by evaluating the contracts off-chain, albeit with the trust assumption of a manager. To avoid the partially trusted manager altogether, a novel approach named zkHawk (IEEE BRAINS '21) explains how we can evaluate the contracts privately off-chain using a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol instead of trusting said manager. This paper dives deeper into the detailed construction of a variant of the zkHawk protocol titled V-zkHawk using formal proofs to construct the said protocol and model its security in the universal composability (UC) framework (FOCS '01). The V-zkHawk protocol discussed here does not support immediate closure, i.e., all the parties (n) have to send a message to inform the blockchain that the contract has been executed with corruption allowed for up to t parties, where t<n. In the most quintessential sense, the V-zkHawk is a variant because the outcome of the protocol is similar (i.e., execution of smart contract via an MPC function evaluation) to zkHawk, but we modify key aspects of the protocol, essentially creating a small trade-off (removing immediate closure) to provide UC (stronger) security. The V-zkHawk protocol leverages joint Schnorr signature schemes, encryption schemes, Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKs), and commitment schemes with Common Reference String (CRS) assumptions, MPC function evaluations, and assumes the existence of asynchronous, authenticated broadcast channels. We achieve malicious security in a dishonest majority setting in the UC framework.	zkhawk;hawk;mpc;v-zkhawk;nizks;universal composabilitysecure multiparty computation;signatures;aggregate;contract
53	实体经济	A Blockchain Protocol for Authenticating Space Communications between Satellites Constellations	Blockchain has found many applications, apart from Bitcoin, in different fields and it has the potential to be very useful in the satellite communications and space industries. Decentralized and secure protocols for processing and manipulating space transactions of satellite swarms in the form of Space Digital Tokens (SDT) can be built using blockchain technology. Tokenizing space transactions using SDTs will open the door to different new blockchain-based solutions for the advancement of constellation-based satellite communications in the space industry. Developing blockchain solutions using smart contracts could be used in securely authenticating various P2P satellite communications and transactions within/between satellite swarms. To manage and secure these transactions, using the proposed SDT concept, this paper suggested a blockchain-based protocol called Proof of Space Transactions (PoST). This protocol was adopted to manage and authenticate the transactions of satellite constellations in a P2P connection. The PoST protocol was prototyped using the Ethereum blockchain and experimented with to evaluate its performance using four metrics: read latency, read throughput, transaction latency, and transaction throughput. The simulation results clarified the efficiency of the proposed PoST protocol in processing and verifying satellite transactions in a short time according to read and transaction latency results. Moreover, the security results showed that the proposed PoST protocol is secure and efficient in verifying satellite transactions according to true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and accuracy metrics. These findings may shape a real attempt to develop a new generation of Blockchain-based satellite constellation systems.	blockchain;proof of space transactions (post);satellites constellations;satellites communications;satellites authenticationnetworks

Many studies have associated cryptocurrencies with bubbles, especially during stressed market conditions such as the recent outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19. Although the majority of studies have focused on Bitcoin, we investigate the predictability of bubble formation in the cryptocurrency market by using the log-periodic power law and we uncover some important stylized facts of this market. Our sample consists of data for a selection of 15 cryptocurrencies for the period between 1 January 2021 and 1 September 2021 which coincides with the second wave of COVID-19. We analyse 86 speculative bubbles, and we find that the cryptocurrency market has three times higher drawdown over equities during stressed market conditions.	covid-19;cryptocurrencies;energy consumption;finance;financial bubbles log-periodic power law;transitory policymarket crashes;empirical laws;black swan;bitcoin;inefficiency;volatility;bubbles;index;model;risk
55	核心技术	Udwadia-Kalaba approach based distributed consensus control for multi-mobile robot systems with communication delays	In this paper, a distributed consensus algorithm for multi-mobile robot systems (MMRSs) with communication delays is proposed based on the Udwadia-Kalaba (UK) approach. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that the consensus requirement is configured as a second-order constraint, and then a concise and explicit equation of motion for the constrained mechanical systems is formulated. Furthermore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving the consensus of MMRSs with or without communication delays are developed under the network topology possessing a directed spanning tree. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed to verify the validity of the proposed consensus algorithm. (C) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

56	实体经济	Low Power Blockchained E-Vote Platform for University Environment	With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the succession of its waves, the transmission of this disease and the number of deaths caused by it have been increasing. Despite the various vaccines, the COVID-19 virus is still contagious and dangerous for affected people. One of the remedies to this is precaution, and particularly social distancing. In the same vein, this paper proposes a remote voting system, which has to be secure, anonymous, irreversible, accessible, and simple to use. It therefore allows voters to have the possibility to vote for their candidate without having to perform the operation on site. This system will be used for university elections and particularly for student elections. We propose a platform based on a decentralized system. This system will use two blockchains communicating with each other: the public Ethereum blockchain and the private Quorum blockchain. The private blockchain will be institution-specific. All these blockchains send the necessary data to the public blockchain which manages different data related to the universities and the ministry. This system enables using encrypted data with the SHA-256 algorithm to have both security and information security. Motivated by the high energy consumption of blockchain and by the performance improvements in low-power, a test is performed on a low-power embedded platform Raspberry PI4 showing the possibility to use the Blockchain with limited resources.	e-vote platform;blockchain;quorum;ethereum;embedded system;raspberry pi4design
57	核心技术	Software Architecture and Non-Fungible Tokens for Digital Twin Decentralized Applications in the Built Environment	Blockchain technology (BCT) can enable distributed collaboration, enhance data sharing, and automate back-end processes for digital twin (DT) decentralized applications (dApps) in the construction industry (CI) 4.0. The aim of this paper was to propose a software architecture and to develop a framework of smart contracts for blockchain-based digital twin (BCDT) dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects in CI 4.0. This paper leveraged the existing literature and action research interviews to identify and validate the critical industry problems, functional requirements (FRs), and non-functional requirements (NFRs) to be addressed by BCDT dApps in CI 4.0. Basic use cases were developed to design a framework of smart contracts for BCDT dApps throughout the lifecycle of projects. The analysis of an online survey was used to identify the key requirements and enablers to propose a software architecture for BCDT applications and to validate the requirements for developing the framework of a smart contract for BCDTs. The findings were: (1) The identification of key problems in CI 4.0 for each BIM/BCDT dimension (3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, and contractual (cD)) and the related FRs and NFRs for BCDT applications. Additionally, key use cases were designed to address the problems identified. (2) The proposed BCDT architecture permitted us to narrow gaps in the literature on blockchain-based decentralized digital twins. Moreover, the proposed BCDT architecture and smart-contract framework addressed the main requirements in the literature on BCDTs. (3) The study leveraged the non-fungible token (NFT) standard to develop a framework for smart contracts that addressed the key use cases and the related industry problems and functional requirements that were identified. The study also considered the contractual dimension (cD) as an overarching dimension in relation to the other BCDT dimensions. (4) We also compared the costs of several public blockchains for executing the proposed smart-contract framework throughout the lifecycle of a medium-sized building project. The cost analysis permitted the development of criteria to evaluate the suitability of blockchain networks for BCDT applications in CI 4.0 depending on the principal blockchain networks' properties (security, decentralization, scalability, and interoperability). Finally, this study resulted in a novel framework that included software architecture, smart-contract use cases, and selection criteria among blockchain networks for BCDT dApps in CI 4.0.	blockchain;construction industry;decentralization;digital twin;ethereum;industry 4;0;internet of things;non-fungible token;smart contractblockchain
58	虚拟经济	The Metaverse as a Virtual Form of Smart Cities: Opportunities and Challenges for Environmental, Economic, and Social Sustainability in Urban Futures	Data infrastructures, economic processes, and governance models of digital platforms are increasingly pervading urban sectors and spheres of urban life. This phenomenon is known as platformization, which has in turn given rise to the phenomena of platform society, where platforms have permeated the core of urban societies. A recent manifestation of platformization is the Metaverse, a global platform project launched by Meta (formerly Facebook) as a globally operating platform company. The Metaverse represents an idea of a hypothetical "parallel virtual world" that incarnate ways of living and working in virtual cities as an alternative to smart cities of the future. Indeed, with emerging innovative technologies-such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, the IoT, and Digital Twins-providing rich datasets and advanced computational understandings of human behavior, the Metaverse has the potential to redefine city designing activities and service provisioning towards increasing urban efficiencies, accountabilities, and quality performance. However, there still remain ethical, human, social, and cultural concerns as to the Metaverse's influence upon the quality of human social interactions and its prospective scope in reconstructing the quality of urban life. This paper undertakes an upper-level literature review of the area of the Metaverse from a broader perspective. Further, it maps the emerging products and services of the Metaverse, and explores their potential contributions to smart cities with respect to their virtual incarnation, with a particular focus on the environmental, economic, and social goals of sustainability. This study may help urban policy makers to better understand the opportunities and implications of the Metaverse upon tech-mediated practices and applied urban agendas, as well as assess the positives and negatives of this techno-urban vision. This paper also offers thoughts regarding the argument that the Metaverse has disruptive and substantive effects on forms of reconstructing reality in an increasingly platformized urban society. This will hopefully stimulate prospective research and further critical perspectives on the topic.	metaverse;smart cities;digital twins;future cities;forecasting;quality of life;urban policy;digital economy;climate change;virtual realitysurveillance
59	实体经济	Investigating the Impact of Bank Housing Credit Risk Control Strategy by Blockchain Technology on the Household Consumption Plan	It is essential to solve the problem of information asymmetry in bank housing credit management, thus reducing bank operating costs and credit risk. Therefore, the present work constructs a bank housing credit blockchain alliance system based on the technical characteristics of blockchain to strengthen bank housing credit risk control. First, according to blockchain's elements and system architecture, the application of blockchain to bank housing credit business is analyzed. On this basis, the bank housing credit risk control strategy is proposed. Finally, the mathematical model is used to investigate residents' household consumption to explore the impact of housing credit on the household consumption plan of residents. The results show that when the educational level of the head of household is illiterate or semi-illiterate, the coefficients of participation credit (PC), nonparticipation credit (NPC), and total samples (TSs) of total household consumption are -0.064, 0.067, and 0.174, respectively; when the educational level of the head of household is primary school or junior middle school, the coefficients of PC, NPC, and TS of total household consumption are -0.026, 0.017, and 0.105, respectively; when the educational level of the head of household is high school or above, the coefficients of PC, NPC, and TS of total household consumption are 0.084, 0.073, and 0.064, respectively. The results indicate that the education level of the head of household plays a crucial role in the family consumption plan. Those with a high educational level will compromise on the best consumption decision after constantly weighing the consumption motivation and consumption thinking after obtaining the credit funds. The content reported here is vitally significant in guiding households to clarify the proportion of credit fund distribution and understand their consumption tendency.	model;price
60	市场治理	Dependence Structure between Bitcoin and Economic Policy Uncertainty: Evidence from Time-Frequency Quantile-Dependence Methods	In this study, the dependence between Bitcoin (BTC) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) of USA and China is estimated by applying the latest methodology of quantile cross-spectral dependence. Daily data comprising a total of 1947 observations and covering the period of 1 October 2013 to 31 January 2019 are used in this study. The findings indicate that a positive return interdependence between BTC and EPU is high in the short term, and this dependence decreases as investment horizons increase from weekly to yearly. The information on the time-varying and time-frequency structure of interdependence is also extracted by applying wavelet coherence analysis. The estimated results of wavelet coherence suggest that the correlation between BTC and EPU is positive during a short-term investment horizon. Finally, the frequency domain Breitung and Candelon causality test is applied, and results show the evidence of insignificant causality between Bitcoin and EPU. Overall, the findings highlight the diversification benefits of Bitcoin during the period of uncertainty.	bitcoin;economic policy uncertainty;spillover;wavelet coherence analysis;quantile cross-spectral dependencevolatility;causality;returns
61	核心技术	Efficient Quantum Blockchain With a Consensus Mechanism QDPoS	Quantum blockchain is expected to offer an alternative to classical blockchain to resist malicious attacks laughed by future quantum computers. Although a few quantum blockchain schemes have been constructed, their efficiency is low and unable to meet application requirements due to the fact that they lack of a suitable consensus mechanism. To tackle this issue, a consensus mechanism called quantum delegated proof of stake (QDPoS) is constructed by using quantum voting to provide fast decentralization for the quantum blockchain scheme at first. Then an efficient scheme is proposed for quantum blockchain based on QDPoS, where the classical information is initialized as a part of each single quantum state and these quantum states are entangled to form the chain. Compared with previous methods, the designed quantum blockchain scheme is more complete and carried out with higher efficiency, which greatly contributes to better adapting to the challenges of the quantum era.	quantum computing;quantum entanglement;digital signatures;consensus protocol;qubit;computers;quantum state;quantum blockchain;consensus mechanism;qdpos;quantum voting;quantum entanglement
62	虚拟经济	NetDAO: Toward Trustful and Secure IoT Networks without Central Gateways	The Internet of Things (IoT) suffers from a profound lack of trust between central gateways and sensors, e.g., gateways suspect sensors of flooding malicious packets, and vice versa, sensors suspect gateways of manipulating traffic data. One important reason for the mistrust is the asymmetry of a centralized network organization. A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) can establish a trustful and symmetric network with the blockchain. However, it is a vacant area for IoT networks to build trust between gateways and sensors within the DAO. In this paper, we firstly propose a trustful and secure IoT Network DAO solution (NetDAO) to mitigate the data manipulation and the malicious flooding packets. In particular, the NetDAO has a security rating algorithm to assign a reputation value for each entity in the network. Based on this, each entity can mitigate the malicious flooding packets using a proof-of-reputation packet-forwarding mechanism. In addition, the NetDAO stores traffic data using the blockchain to mitigate the data manipulation. The experimental results show that the NetDAO effectively mitigates malicious flooding packets and costs 1 s for similar to 480 entities to complete the rating algorithm.	iot;dao;blockchain;trustful networklightweight blockchain;framework;internet;system;management;attacks;ddos;dao

Among them, phishing scams on the blockchain are regarded as a serious threat to the trading security of the blockchain ecosystem. By modeling the transaction data of blockchain as a network, a series of graph-based phishing detection frameworks have been proposed. Enlightened by adversarial attacks of graph data, we propose to verify the robustness of current phishing detection frameworks under intentional attackers aiming to hide phishing behaviors. In this study, we first propose a general phishing detection framework based on feature engineering and then propose a phishing hiding framework combing the greedy selection mechanism with four phishing hiding strategies to measure the robustness of the proposed general detection models. Extensive experiments evaluate the detective performance of the phishing detection model and its robustness against the hiding framework. The experimental results indicate that the detective model based on feature engineering is rather fragile under adversarial attacks.	phishing;blockchains;feature extraction;robustness;perturbation methods;computer crime;biological system modeling;adversarial attacks;blockchain;ethereum;phishing detection;phishing hiding
64	实体经济	A revocable attribute-based encryption EHR sharing scheme with multiple authorities in blockchain	With the development of digital healthcare, sharing electronic medical record data has become an indispensable part of improving medical conditions. Aiming at the centralized power caused by the single attribute authority in current CP-ABE schemes and the problem that cloud servers are curious and even malicious, we design a revocable CP-ABE EHR sharing scheme with multiple authorities (MA-RABE) in blockchain. In this solution, a group of authorities complete user attribute distribution, key generation and user management through secret sharing and transactions. Besides, we innovatively implemented a distributed one-way anonymous key agreement so that other participants cannot obtain useful information from the fully hidden policy embedded in the ciphertext. Taking into account the computational overhead of a large number of bilinear operations in the decryption process, the solution also supports the cloud server to pre-decrypt the ciphertext, and the data user only needs to perform exponentiation operation once to obtain the plaintext from the pre-decryption result. Theoretical analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme has reliable security and lower user revocation and ciphertext update overhead.	blockchain;data sharing;attribute-based encryption;ehr sharingaccess-control;efficient;system
65	实体经济	Analysis of Blockchain in the Healthcare Sector: Application and Issues	The emergence of blockchain technology makes it possible to address disparate distributed system security concerns in formerly ridiculous practices. A key factor of this ability is the decentralization of the symmetrically distributed ledgers of blockchain. Such decentralization has replaced several security functionalities of centralized authority with the use of cryptographic systems. That is, public or asymmetric cryptography is the key part of what makes blockchain technology possible. Recently, the blockchain experience introduces the chance for the healthcare field to implement these knowhows in their electronic records. This adoption supports retaining and sharing the symmetrical patient records with the appropriate alliance of hospitals and healthcare providers in a secure decentralized system, using asymmetric cryptography like hashing, digitally signed transactions, and public key infrastructure. These include specialized applications for drug tracking, applications for observing patients, or Electronic Health Records (EHR). Therefore, it is essential to notice that the principled awareness of the healthcare professionals is the leading point of the right perception ethics. In this work, we provide a thorough review of the issues and applications of utilizing blockchain in the healthcare and medical fields emphasizing the particular challenges and aspects. The study adopted a systematic review of secondary literature in answering the research question. Specifically, this paper aims to investigate how blockchain technology can be applied to improve the overall performance of the healthcare sector and to explore the various challenges and concerns of the application of blockchain in the healthcare system.	healthcare;blockchain;symmetric ledgers;asymmetric cryptography;integrity
66	协同技术	On Convergence Probability of Direct Acyclic Graph-Based Ledgers in Forking Blockchain Systems	Direct acyclic graph (DAG)-based ledger is a promising technology for the Internet of things (IoT). Compared with a single-chain topology, DAG and forking blockchain topology can solve some problems in IoT, such as high resource consumption, high transaction fee, low transaction throughput, and long confirmation delay. We propose the convergence probability to aid further analysis of the performance and security of DAG-based ledgers. Under unsteady load regimes, the convergence probability is the probability of each possible cumulative weight of the observed transaction when it is approved by all new arrival transactions. In this article, we derive a closed-form expression and an approximate expression of the convergence probability under the high-to-low regime (H2LR). Also, we verify the accuracy of the derived expressions through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Numerical results shows that the simulation results match well with its analytical results, which indicates the accuracy of the exact expression and the approximate expression of the convergence probability.	convergence;internet of things;blockchains;consensus algorithm;mathematical models;throughput;probability distribution;blockchain;convergence probability;direct acyclic graph (dag);forking topology;markov chain monte carlo algorithm

By combining two perspectives on blockchain in SCM, this study provides comprehensive knowledge in this field using a bibliometric approach.

68	协同技术	Quantum-assisted blockchain for IoT based on quantum signature	The Internet of things (IoT) is a heterogeneous network, and devices produced by different manufacturers lack trust and coordination mechanisms, so they are vulnerable to attacks. Blockchain can provide credible communication at a low cost for IoT nodes. However, the classic digital signature algorithms commonly used in blockchain are no longer secure enough against quantum computing attacks. Given that the emergence of universal quantum computers is just around the corner, we propose a quantum-assisted blockchain of things (QBoT) based on quantum signature. This scheme can protect IoT systems from computation-based attacks and provide more secure communication assurance between nodes. Finally, we analyze the possible attacks on the IoT, and the results show that our proposed scheme can guarantee the security of common IoT attacks. Furthermore, compared with previous quantum-assisted blockchain schemes, QBoT is more efficient and scalable.	blockchain;internet of things;quantum signature;asymmetric cryptography;quantum securityinternet
69	实体经济	Defensive Distillation-Based Adversarial Attack Mitigation Method for Channel Estimation Using Deep Learning Models in Next-Generation Wireless Networks	Future wireless networks (5G and beyond), also known as Next Generation or NextG, are the vision of forthcoming cellular systems, connecting billions of devices and people together. In the last decades, cellular networks have dramatically grown with advanced telecommunication technologies for high-speed data transmission, high cell capacity, and low latency. The main goal of those technologies is to support a wide range of new applications, such as virtual reality, metaverse, telehealth, online education, autonomous and flying vehicles, smart cities, smart grids, advanced manufacturing, and many more. The key motivation of NextG networks is to meet the high demand for those applications by improving and optimizing network functions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a high potential to achieve these requirements by being integrated into applications throughout all network layers. However, the security concerns on network functions of NextG using AI-based models, i.e., model poisoning, have not been investigated deeply. It is crucial to protect the next-generation cellular networks against cybersecurity threats, especially adversarial attacks. Therefore, it needs to design efficient mitigation techniques and secure solutions for NextG networks using AI-based methods. This paper proposes a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation models trained with the dataset obtained from MATLAB's 5G toolbox for adversarial attacks and defensive distillation-based mitigation methods. The adversarial attacks produce faulty results by manipulating trained DL-based models for channel estimation in NextG networks while mitigation methods can make models more robust against adversarial attacks. This paper also presents the performance of the proposed defensive distillation mitigation method for each adversarial attack. The results indicate that the proposed mitigation method can defend the DL-based channel estimation models against adversarial attacks in NextG networks.	channel estimation;next generation networking;artificial intelligence;solid modeling;5g mobile communication;wireless networks;security;adversarial machine learning;trustworthy ai;security;next-generation networks;adversarial machine learning;model poisoning;channel estimationmachine;5g;6g

Recently Machine Learning (ML) has been widely used in automation, consumer behavior analysis, device quality upgradation, etc. Typical ML predicts by analyzing customers' raw data in a centralized system which raises the security and privacy issues such as data leakage, privacy violation, single point of failure, etc. To overcome the problems, Federated Learning (FL) developed an initial solution to ensure services without sharing personal data. In FL, a centralized aggregator collaborates and makes an average for a global model used for the next round of training. However, the centralized aggregator raised the same issues, such as a single point of control leaking the updated model and interrupting the entire process. Additionally, research claims data can be retrieved from model parameters. Beyond that, since the Gateway (GW) device has full access to the raw data, it can also threaten the entire ecosystem. This research contributes a blockchain-controlled, edge intelligence federated learning framework for a distributed learning platform for CIoT. The federated learning platform allows collaborative learning with users' shared data, and the blockchain network replaces the centralized aggregator and ensures secure participation of gateway devices in the ecosystem. Furthermore, blockchain is trustless, immutable, and anonymous, encouraging CIoT end users to participate. We evaluated the framework and federated learning outcomes using the well-known Stanford Cars dataset. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework.	federated machine learning;deep learning;blockchain;distributed learning;distributed edge computing;information security;privacy-preserving computingframework
72	实体经济	A Research on the Sharing Platform of Wild Bird Data in Yunnan Province Based on Blockchain and Interstellar File System	Sharing scientific data is an effective means to rationally exploit scientific data and is vital to promote the development of the industrial chain and improve the level of science and technology. In recent years, the popularity of the open data platform has increased, but problems remain, including imperfect system architecture, unsound privacy and security, and non-standardized interaction data. To address these problems, the blockchain's decentralization, smart contracts, distributed storage, and other features can be used as the core technology for open data systems. This paper addresses the problems of opening, allocation-right confirmation, sharing, and rational use of wild-bird data from Yunnan Province, China. A data storage model is proposed based on the blockchain and interstellar file system and is applied to wild-bird data to overcome the mutual distrust between ornithology institutions in the collaborative processing and data storage of bird data. The model provides secure storage and secure access control of bird data in the cloud, thereby ensuring the decentralized and secure storage of wild-bird data for multiple research institutions.	blockchain;bird big data;interplanetary file system;data sharingchallenges;security
73	市场治理	Leveraging digital and relational governance mechanisms in developing trusting supply chain relationships: the interplay between blockchain and norm of solidarity	Purpose Drawing on the signaling theory and the relational exchange theory, this study investigates how buyer-supplier trust is influenced through the congruence and incongruence between blockchain and norm of solidarity. The moderating role of technology uncertainty is further examined. Design/methodology/approach Using a survey data of 110 Chinese firms, this study empirically tests not only the combined effect of blockchain and norm of solidarity on trust, but also how this combined effect is moderated by technology uncertainty. The proposed hypotheses are tested using the polynomial regression analysis and the response surface methodology. Findings The results suggest that trust increases along with an increasing congruence between blockchain and norm or solidarity, but in a diminishing rate (i.e. an inverted U-shaped relationship). Simultaneously, incongruence between blockchain and norm of solidarity can also guarantee sufficient trust (i.e. a U-shaped relationship). Moreover, technology uncertainty overturns the inverted U-shaped relationship between blockchain and norm of solidarity congruence on trust into a U-shaped relationship and nullifies the U-shaped relationship between blockchain and norm of solidarity incongruence on trust. Originality/value This study enriches supply chain governance literature by introducing the emerging blockchain governance and examining the blockchain governance's interplay with a conventional relational norm. The study emphasizes that the combined effects of these two are quite complex. Blockchain and norm of solidarity can offset each other's limitations when both are at low to moderate levels. But simultaneous pursuit of both high blockchain and norm has only limited marginal benefits. Furthermore, the study also highlights the importance of technology uncertainty under which the combined effects between the two governance mechanisms vary. Collectively, the results provide nuanced insights into the design of supply chain governance portfolios in the digital era.	blockchain;relational governance;trust;technology uncertaintypolynomial regression;firm performance;signaling theory;method variance;management;opportunism;technology;logistics;contracts;view

The Strategic Equilibrium of Blockchain Technology Adoption Strategy for Competing Agri-Food Supply Chains	Despite the touting value of blockchain technology (BT), many agri-food supply chains are still struggling to the adoption of it. In this article, incorporating the benefit and cost associated with BT, we seek to answer whether and under what conditions can two competing agri-food supply chains benefit from the adoption of BT, and how government choose optimal subsidy scheme to promote the adoption of BT. The findings suggest that the Nash equilibrium outcome toward BT adoption strategy will be greatly affected by key parameters, such as competitive intensity, the growth rate of the market size and the investment cost with the adoption of BT, and the planting cost of the agri-food. Specifically, early adopter can always snatch more benefit from the adoption of the BT than the follower, and the gap between them will be increased in the competition intensity. In addition, the decisions selected by agri-food supply chains does not always benefit the consumer surplus and the social welfare, which call for further government subsidy scheme to promote the adoption of BT. The findings provide important implications for both the industrial managers and policy makers on how to benefit from BT in the digital transformation era.	supply chains;costs;government;agricultural products;production;safety;uncertainty;agri-food supply chain;blockchain technology (bt);competition;government subsidy;nash equilibriumsafety incidents;traceability;management;agriculture;challenges;operations

The main goal was to evaluate the feasibility in terms of design, perceived benefits, and challenges of applying blockchain and traceability from the users' perspective. We implemented a prototype using a user-centered iterative interface design. Then we used the prototype to answer our research questions in mixed-method research, including in-depth interviews (10 participants) and a survey (350 participants) with stakeholders in the coffee supply chain in Thailand. The results showed that timeline-based design was preferred over map-based or text-based design for the visualization of traceability information and that blockchain was a promising technology, as 67% of the survey participants saw a positive influence of blockchain on the adoption of applications. The most notable benefits were origin checking and increasing product trustworthiness. The most notable challenges were inaccurate or incomplete information and the disclosure of trade secrets. More work is required to address the challenges for everyone in the supply chain ecosystem to adopt the proposed traceability system, including (1) providing trustworthiness and completeness of information by cross-checking with third parties or other users, (2) protecting sensitive information by aligning users' interests or allowing control of information disclosure, and (3) educating and giving producers the motivation for the difficulty and the extra work.	blockchains;supply chains;interviews;stakeholders;bitcoin;user centered design;food products;food manufacturing;blockchain;coffee;supply chain;traceability;user-centered design;interview;surveyfood;reliability;challenges
76	实体经济	Improving information alignment and coordination in humanitarian supply chain through blockchain technology	Purpose The coordination among the various entities such as the military, government agencies, civilians, non-governmental agencies, and other commercial enterprises is one of the most challenging aspects of managing the humanitarian supply chain. Blockchain technology (BCT) can facilitate coordination, but the cost and other hindrances have limited their application in disaster relief operations. Despite some studies, the existing literature does not provide a nuanced understanding of the application of blockchain technology to improve information alignment and coordination. Motivated by some recent examples where blockchain technology has been used to trace and mobilize resources in the form of funds and materials from the origin to the destination, the authors develop a theoretical model grounded in the contingent resource-based view. Design/methodology/approach To empirically validate the model and test the research hypotheses, the authors gathered cross-sectional data using a structured pre-tested questionnaire. In this study, the authors gathered our responses from international non-governmental organizations from twenty-four countries. The authors performed the statistical analyses using variance-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with the help of commercial software (WarpPLS 7.0). Findings The findings of the study offer some useful implications for theory and practice. The results obtained through statistical analyses suggest that the BCT significantly affects information alignment and coordination. However, contrary to popular beliefs the study suggests that intergroup leadership has no significant moderating effect on the paths joining BCT and information alignment/coordination. Moreover, the authors found that the control variable (interdependence) significantly affects the information alignment and coordination further, which opens the room for further investigation. Practical implications The result of the study offers some useful guidance. Firstly, it suggests that humanitarian organizations should invest in BCT to improve information alignment and coordination which is one of the most complex tasks in front of humanitarian organizations. Secondly, intergroup leadership may not have desired influence on the effects of BCT on information alignment/coordination. However, the interdependence of the humanitarian organizations on each other may have a significant influence on the information alignment/coordination. Originality/value The study offers some useful implications for theory. For instance, how BCT influences information alignment and coordination was not well understood in the context of humanitarian settings. Hence, this study offers a nuanced understanding of technology-enabled coordination in humanitarian settings.	blockchain technology;intergroup leadership;humanitarian supply chain;pls-sem;information alignment;coordinationoperations management research;collaborative performance;resource;leadership;logistics;bias;nonresponse;perspective;challenges;variance

78	实体经济	A Local Electricity and Carbon Trading Method for Multi-Energy Microgrids Considering Cross-Chain Interaction	The objective of this paper is to propose a local electricity and carbon trading method for interconnected multi-energy microgrids. A local electricity market and a local carbon market are established, allowing microgrids to trade electricity and carbon allowance within the microgrid network. Specifically, excessive electricity and carbon allowance of a microgrid can be shared with other microgrids that require them. A local electricity trading problem and a local carbon trading problem are formulated for multi-energy microgrids using the Nash bargaining theory. Each Nash bargaining problem can be decomposed into two subproblems, including an energy/carbon scheduling problem and a payment bargaining problem. By solving the subproblems of the Nash bargaining problems, the traded amounts of electricity/carbon allowance between microgrids and the corresponding payments will be determined. In addition, to enable secure information interactions and trading payments, we introduce an electricity blockchain and a carbon blockchain to record the trading data for microgrids. The novelty of the usage of the blockchain technology lies in using a notary mechanism-based cross-chain interaction method to achieve value transfer between blockchains. The simulation results show that the proposed local electricity and carbon trading method has great performance in lowering total payments and carbon emissions for microgrids.	multi-energy microgrid;electricity and carbon trading;nash bargaining;blockchain;cross-chain interactionenergy
79	协同技术	A Volunteer Computing Architecture for Computational Workflows on Decentralized Web	The amount of accessible computational devices over the Internet offers an enormous but latent computational power. Nonetheless, the complexity of orchestrating and managing such devices requires dedicated architectures and tools and hinders the exploitation of this vast processing capacity. Over the last years, the paradigm of (Browser-based) Volunteer Computing emerged as a unique approach to harnessing such computational capabilities, leveraging the idea of voluntarily offering resources. This article proposes VFuse, a groundbreaking architecture to exploit the Browser-based Volunteer Computing paradigm via a ready-to-access volunteer network. VFuse offers a modern multi-language programming environment for developing scientific workflows using WebAssembly technology without requiring the user any local installation or configuration. We equipped our architecture with a secure and transparent rewarding mechanism based on blockchain technology (Ethereum) and distributed P2P file system (IPFS). Further, the use of Non-Fungible Tokens provides a unique, secure, and transparent methodology for recognizing the users' participation in the network. We developed a prototype of the proposed architecture and four example applications implemented with our system. All code and examples are publicly available on GitHub.	scientific computing;servers;computer architecture;browsers;distributed processing;computer applications;blockchains;web 3;0;parallel processing;scientific computing;volunteer computing;browser-based volunteer computing;decentralized web;web 3;0;p2p;webassembly;distributed computing;parallel computing

Our results reveal that the number of structural breaks of Bitcoin has remained the same at five. The Solidification phase started 8 months prior to the onset of the pandemic, signifying the small effect of the pandemic on Bitcoin price. During the pandemic, Bitcoin was more susceptible to underlying economic factors than to either COVID-related variables alone or to a combination of both factors. We conclude that Bitcoin has reached a certain level of maturity as an investment vehicle.	bitcoin;structural break;maturity;covid-19 pandemic
81	核心技术	Representative Ring Signature Algorithm Based on Smart Contract	Traditional ring signature algorithms suffer from large signature data capacity and low speed of signature and verification during collective signing. In this work, we propose a representative ring signature algorithm based on smart contracts. By collecting the opinions of the signatory based on multiparty secure computation, the proposed technique protects the privacy of the signatory during the data interaction process in the consortium chain. Moreover, the proposed method uses smart contracts to organize the signature process and formulate a signature strategy of "one encryption per signature" to prevent signature forgery. It uses the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the signature test platform of the consortium chain to perform the experiments. We compare the results of the proposed method with the ECC ring signature scheme. The experimental results show that in the worst case, the signature volume of the proposed method decreases by more than two times, and the signature speed and verification speed increase by more than three times. Therefore, in the collective signature scenario of transaction verification in the consortium chain, the proposed method is verified to be innovative and practical.	ring signature;multiparty secure computation;consortium chain;smart contractzero-knowledge proof;data-security;consortium blockchain;privacy;scheme
82	实体经济	A Secure and Traceable Vehicles and Parts System Based on Blockchain and Smart Contract	As society advances, so does the total number of vehicles on the road, creating a massive consumer market for automobiles. According to statistics, a major portion of today's traffic difficulties are caused by accidents caused by subpar cars and auto parts. As a result, each country has, over time, enacted equivalent rules and regulations to prevent such tragedies. However, in the face of profit, some people are desperate enough to employ illegal parts and illegally modified cars, and auto fraud is rampant. As a result, we employ the blockchain of the symmetrical Blockchain's digital ledger and smart contract technology to build a decentralized supply chain system that can identify specific parts. In this study, we design and discuss the proposed system framework by user functions and the flow of parts based on blockchain, and we discuss communication protocols that use the symmetry and asymmetry cryptography, algorithms, properties, and security of the mechanism while providing related analysis and comparing the properties and costs of the system with other studies. Overall, the proposed method has the potential to successfully address the issue of automobile fraud.	blockchain;smart contract;automation supply chain;traceability;asymmetry cryptography
83	虚拟经济	Immersive cultural heritage digital documentation and information service for historical figure metaverse: a case of Zhu Xi, Song Dynasty, China	Cultural heritage is closely linked with individual historical figures, who become a key focus for cultural tourism. Confucianism laid the foundation for much of Chinese civilization, and Confucius and Mencius have been studied extensively and have been influential in many parts of the world. Zhu Xi, the founder and master of Neo-Confucianism (an important part of the Mount Wuyi world cultural heritage), has received less research attention. With the big bang of the metaverse, research on the immersive cultural heritage digital documentation and information service for historical figures has become a new perspective. This paper presents a metaverse-based digital documentation framework for historical figures. This framework addresses the digitization of multimodal data for cultural heritage and adapts to the needs of metaverse presentations. For cultural research and cultural preservation, the paper has explored a combined contactless virtual and real cultural heritage experience system. For tourists, we intend to develop an immersive and holistic cultural tourism information service before, during and after the tour. In particular, we have also developed the Zhu Xi metaverse system. This is a step forward in the construction of a metaverse of historical figures.	zhu xi;metaverse;cultural heritage;digital documentation;virtual reality;tourism servicevirtual tour
84	虚拟经济	Design of Secure Mutual Authentication Scheme for Metaverse Environments Using Blockchain	During the COVID-19 pandemic, engagement in various remote activities such as online education and meetings has increased. However, since the conventional online environments typically provide simple streaming services using cameras and microphones, there have limitations in terms of physical expression and experiencing real-world activities such as cultural and economic activities. Recently, metaverse environments, three-dimensional virtual reality that use avatars, have attracted increasing attention as a means to solve these problems. Thus, many metaverse platforms such as Roblox, Minecraft, and Fortnite have been emerging to provide various services to users. However, such metaverse environments are potentially vulnerable to various security threats because the users and platform servers communicate through public channels. In addition, sensitive user data such as identity, password, and biometric information are managed by each platform server. In this paper, we design a system model that can guarantee secure communication and transparently manage user identification data in metaverse environments using blockchain technology. We also propose a mutual authentication scheme using biometric information and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to provide secure communication between users and platform servers and secure avatar interactions between avatars and avatars. To demonstrate the security of the proposed mutual authentication scheme, we perform informal security analysis, Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, Real-or-Random (ROR) model, and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA). In addition, we compare the computation costs, communication costs, and security features of the proposed scheme with existing schemes in similar environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has lower computation and communication costs and can provide a wider range of security features than existing schemes. Thus, our proposed scheme can be used to provide secure metaverse environments.	metaverse;avatars;blockchains;security;authentication;servers;solid modeling;cryptography;metaverse;avatar;authentication;ban logic;ror model;avispa;blockchain;elliptic curve cryptography;biohashingkey agreement protocol
85	实体经济	Blockchain Smart Contract-Enabled Secure Energy Trading for Electric Vehicles	In this paper, a blockchain-enabled energy trading method is proposed to deal with the inefficiency and security issues in energy trading for electric vehicles in smart grids. It includes the design of a smart contract and the excitation mechanism of energy sharing. The credit points of each vehicle as a node are considered in the design of the smart contract, which is used to supervise the process of energy trading. A strategy to estimate the credit points of each node and describe the excitation mechanism is illustrated. The connection between the credit points and the probability that a node would be accepted for energy trading has been established. To control the energy trading access, a double auction method is used to choose the part of the nodes participating in energy trading. Only selected nodes with winning bids can supply or request energy from the blockchain-based platform. Then it reaches the conclusion that the higher the credit points they have, the more trading initiative they would have during the energy transaction and transmission. The smart contract design and the excitation mechanism proposed in this paper would reward the vehicles that perform well and punish the beguiling vehicles for regulating the trading process.	energy trading;electric vehicles;blockchain;incentive mechanism;smart contract
86	虚拟经济	Blockchain-Empowered Service Management for the Decentralized Metaverse of Things	The future of networking will be driven by the current emerging trends of combining the physical and virtual realities in cyberspace. Considering the ambient pandemic challenges, the role of virtual and augmented reality will definitely grow over time by transforming into the paradigm of the Metaverse of Things, where each person, thing or other entity will simultaneously exist within multiple synchronized realities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for future metaverse applications composed of multiple synchronized data flows from multiple operators through multiple wearable devices and with different quality requirements. A new service quality model is proposed based on a customizable utility function for each individual data flow. The proposed approach is based on dynamic fine-grained data flow allocation and service selection using non-fungible tokens, which can be traded over the blockchain among users and operators in a decentralized mobile network environment.	metaverse;synchronization;quality of service;5g mobile communication;artificial intelligence;market research;wearable computers;blockchains;internet of things;blockchain;metaverse;the iot;nft;5g;6gproof-of-work;security framework;industrial iot;edge-cloud;hyperledger;technology;internet;systems;impact
87	实体经济	A System for the Promotion of Traceability and Ownership of Health Data Using Blockchain	The advent of wireless technologies and the development of more and better globally connected mobile devices, leverage real time health monitoring. Mobile health (m-health) promise to deliver health services anytime and anywhere, improving user convenience and enabling faster diagnoses without the need to travel to healthcare facilities. The use of m-health applications on mobile devices with the support of cloud computing is nowadays a technology trend that has many advantages, but also poses several challenges, especially on the data storage and privacy. Blockchain technology is an exponentially growing technology used in various research areas from finance, voting mechanisms, production chains, among others. This technology provides important characteristics such as immutability, non-repudiation, transparency, and reducing the need for intermediaries. Hence, this paper presents a novel approach for blockchain technology applied to m-health systems. This proposal allows an easy and fast integration with other health systems or applications, allowing a patient-user to access their electronic health record in a more secure way. The data is traceable throughout the system, however, maintaining the necessary anonymity. Hence, a prototype for a blockchain-based solution using Hyperledger Fabric was developed. This implementation enables the creation of a chronologically organized and immutable health data record. To create an anonymous storage system, the proposed system uses two separate database components that maintain data traceability through sets of IDs stored in the blockchain. Furthermore, the development of the proposed system was evaluated in terms of performance and network configurations of the Hyperledger Fabric.	blockchains;medical services;security;mobile handsets;monitoring;real-time systems;data privacy;data processing;medical information systems;internet of things;electronic healthcare;blockchain;traceability;data;electronic health record;internet of things;mobile healthdata-security;technologies;privacy;care
88	协同技术	DDoS Attack Prevention for Internet of Thing Devices Using Ethereum Blockchain Technology	The Internet of Things (IoT) has widely expanded due to its advantages in enhancing the business, industrial, and social ecosystems. Nevertheless, IoT infrastructure is susceptible to several cyber-attacks due to the endpoint devices' restrictions in computation, storage, and communication capacity. As such, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the security of the IoT. Attackers can easily utilize IoT devices as part of botnets to launch DDoS attacks by taking advantage of their flaws. This paper proposes an Ethereum blockchain model to detect and prevent DDoS attacks against IoT systems. Additionally, the proposed system can be used to resolve the single points of failure (dependencies on third parties) and privacy and security in IoT systems. First, we propose implementing a decentralized platform in place of current centralized system solutions to prevent DDoS attacks on IoT devices at the application layer by authenticating and verifying these devices. Second, we suggest tracing and recording the IP address of malicious devices inside the blockchain to prevent them from connecting and communicating with the IoT networks. The system performance has been evaluated by performing 100 experiments to evaluate the time taken by the authentication process. The proposed system highlights two messages with a time of 0.012 ms: the first is the request transmitted from the IoT follower device to join the blockchain, and the second is the blockchain response. The experimental evaluation demonstrated the superiority of our system because there are fewer I/O operations in the proposed system than in other related works, and thus it runs substantially faster.	blockchain;ethereum;smart contract;authorization;ddos attacks;iotauthentication

The research finds that e-CNY will have significant impact on monetary policy: (1) E-CNY will change the structure of money demand, speed up currency circulation, make central bank reserves more controllable and money supply more intelligent; (2) E-CNY will increase the volatility and expansion effect of currency multiplier to a certain extent; (3) E-CNY will dredge the transmission channel of monetary policy so as to improve the transmission effect of existing monetary policy tools. At the same time, based on the organic combination with structural monetary policy tools, it will achieve precise implementation of medium-term lending facilities (MLF), pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and it may bring new monetary policy tools. (4) E-CNY will make the intermediate target of monetary policy more controllable and reliable, and have a positive impact on the target of monetary policy through the smooth transmission of monetary policy channels. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on CBDC, give full play to the positive role of e-CNY in monetary policy, and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.	currency;private;bitcoin;money;world
90	市场治理	Analysis of the Features and Structure Behind Availability in Blockchain Using Altcoin	Data availability is a security factor in a blockchain that is challenging to understand and explain because it cannot be described cryptographically or mathematically because of its behavior-dependent properties on the volunteers who maintain the distributed ledger in the network. Most previous approaches have frequently used successful projects with empirically effective availability, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, to analyze more active blockchain networks. Therefore, even if much of the Altcoin forked from Bitcoin had nodes in the network, contrary to intuition because they were unpopular and failed projects, they were not the focus of much attention in the analysis. However, it is interesting to note that both can maintain availability. Considering the network structure that supports availability, it is possible to investigate Altcoin's features as a minimal component because it is a failed project, whereas it is challenging to do so with Bitcoin and Ethereum because of their complex components. Thus, we specifically selected Altcoin in decline based on our user role model. We investigated the features of the network that maintain availability and the user structure underlying Altcoin, focusing on factors associated with continuity, such as initial node survivability, interest in software updates, and nodes with security risks. We discovered that compared with a stand-alone organization, the actions of early users and few community-friendly users provide greater availability. We also discuss the motivations of these users based on the cost of installing the nodes.	blockchains;bitcoin;costs;distributed ledger;software development management;codes;behavioral sciences;cryptocurrency;blockchain;cryptocurrency;altcoin;availabilitynetwork;bitcoin
91	市场治理	Information transmission among energy markets, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins under pandemic conditions	This paper investigates the directional causal relationship and information transmission among the returns of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), Brent, major cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins by drawing on daily data from July 2019 to July 2020. Applying effective transfer entropy, a non-parametric statistic, the results show that the direction of the causal relationship and the nature of information spillovers changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. More precisely, our findings reveal that WTI and Brent are leading the prices of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Conversely, Bitcoin futures and stablecoins (TrueUSD and USD Coin) are leading WTI and Brent prices. In addition, the stablecoin Tether became a leader against Brent prices after the pandemic, although it is still following WTI prices. Moreover, Ethereum and USD coin preserved their position as leaders against Brent prices. Interestingly, our results also reveal that Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple preserved their position as leaders of WTI prices. The change in the nature of directional causality and the spillover effect after the COVID-19 crisis provide valuable information for practitioners, investors, and policymakers on how the ongoing pandemic influences the connection and network correlation among the energy, cryptocurrency, and stablecoin markets.	information transmission;effective transfer entropy;wti;brent;cryptocurrencies;stablecoinssafe-haven;bitcoin;commodity;uncertainty;causality;volatility;exchange;hedge;gold;flow
92	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Crowdsourcing Makes Training Dataset of Machine Learning No Longer Be in Short Supply	Recently, machine learning has become popular in various fields like healthcare, smart transportation, network, and big data. However, the labelled training dataset, which is one of the most core of machine learning, cannot meet the requirements of quantity, quality, and diversity due to the limitation of data sources. Crowdsourcing systems based on mobile computing seem to address the bottlenecks faced by machine learning due to their unique advantages; i.e., crowdsourcing can make professional and nonprofessional participate in the collection and annotation process, which can greatly improve the quantity of the training dataset. Additionally, distributed blockchain technology can be embedded into crowdsourcing systems to make it transparent, secure, traceable, and decentralized. Moreover, truth discovery algorithm can improve the accuracy of annotation. Reasonable incentive mechanism will attract many workers to provide plenty of dataset. In this paper, we review studies applying mobile crowdsourcing to training dataset collection and annotation. In addition, after reviewing researches on blockchain or incentive mechanism, we propose a new possible combination of machine learning and crowdsourcing systems.	truth discovery;efficient;mechanism;framework;aware
93	协同技术	Internet of Things Aware Secure Dew Computing Architecture for Distributed Hotspot Network: A Conceptual Study	Building a widely distributed hotspot network is a very tedious task due to its complexity. Providing security, fully distributed network services, and a cost-conscious impact are the major challenges behind this goal. To overcome these issues, we have presented a novel distributed hotspot network architecture with five layers that can provide large-scale hotspot coverage as an assimilated result. Our contributions to this new architecture highlight important aspects. First, scalability can be increased by including many Internet of Things (IoT) devices with sensors and Wi-Fi and/or LoraWAN connectivity modules. Second, hotspot owners can rent out their hotspots to create a distributed hotspot network in which the hotspots can act as an ordinary data gateway, a full-fledged hotspot miner, and a light-weight hotspot miner to earn crypto tokens as rewards for certain activities. Third, the advantages of Wi-Fi and LoraWAN can be seamlessly leveraged to achieve optimal coverage, higher network security, and suitable data transmission rate for transferring sensor data from IoT devices to remote application servers and users. Fourth, blockchain is used to enhance the decentralized behavior of the architecture that is presented here by providing immutability and independence from a centralized regulator and making the network architecture more reliable and transparent. The main feature of our paper is the use of the dew-computing paradigm along with hotspots to improve availability, Internet backhaul-agnostic network coverage, and synchronous update capability, and dew-aware leasing to strengthen and improve coverage. We also discuss the key challenges and future roadmap that require further investment and deployment.	dew computing;internet of things;blockchain;hotspot networkblockchain;attacks;infrastructure;challenges
94	协同技术	A blockchain and IoT-based lightweight framework for enabling information transparency in supply chain finance	Supply Chain Finance (SCF) refers to the financial service in which banks rely on core enterprises to manage the capital flow and logistics of upstream and downstream enterprises. SCF adopts a self-testing and closed-loop credit model to control funds and risks. The key factor in a successful SCF service is the deployment of SCF businessoriented information systems that allow businesses to form partnerships efficiently and expedite cash flows throughout the supply chain. Blockchain Technology (BCT), featuring decentralization, tamper-proofing, traceability, which is usually paired with the Internet of Things (IoT) in real-world contexts, has been widely adopted in the field of finance and is perfectly positioned to facilitate innovative collaborations among participants in supply chain networks. In this paper, we propose a BCT and IoT-based information management framework (named BC4Regu), which works as the regulatory to improve the information transparency in the business process of SCF. With BC4Regu, the operation cost of the whole supply chain can be significantly reduced through the coordination and integration of capital flow, information flow, logistics and trade flow in the supply chain. The contributions in this paper include: (1) proposing a novel information management framework which leverages Blockchain and IoT to solve the problem of information asymmetry in the trade of SCF; (2) proposing the technical design of BC4Regu, including the Blockchain infrastructure, distributed ledger-based integrated data flow service, and reshaped SCF process; and (3) applying BC4Regu to a group of scenarios and conducting theoretical analysis by introducing the principal-agent model to validate the BC4Regu.	blockchain;supply chain finance;information asymmetry;information transparency;internet of thingstechnology

To this end, the emerging "Blockchain as a Service" (BaaS) makes the blockchain and distributed ledgers more accessible, particularly for businesses, by reducing costs and overheads. BaaS combines the high computing power of cloud computing, the pervasiveness of IoT and the decentralization of blockchain, allowing people to build their own applications while ensuring the transparency and openness of the system. This paper surveys the research outputs of both academia and industry. First, it introduces the representative architectures of BaaS systems and then summarizes the research contributions of BaaS from the technologies for service provision, roles, container and virtualization, interfaces, customization and evaluation. The typical applications of BaaS in both academic and practical domains are also introduced. At present, the research on the blockchain is abundant, but research on BaaS is still in its infancy. Six challenges of BaaS are concluded in this paper for further study directions.	blockchain as a service;blockchain;service;internet of things;cloud computingframework;internet;systems

97	技术治理	Overcoming Data Availability Attacks in Blockchain Systems: Short Code-Length LDPC Code Design for Coded Merkle Tree	Light nodes in blockchains improve the scalability of the system by storing a small portion of the blockchain ledger. In certain blockchains, light nodes are vulnerable to a data availability (DA) attack where a malicious node makes the light nodes accept an invalid block by hiding the invalid portion of the block from the nodes in the system. Recently, a technique based on LDPC codes called Coded Merkle Tree (CMT) was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect a DA attack by randomly requesting/sampling portions of the block from the malicious node. However, light nodes fail to detect a DA attack with high probability if a malicious node hides a small stopping set of the LDPC code. To mitigate this problem, Yu et al. used random LDPC codes that achieve large minimum stopping set size with high probability. Although effective, these codes are not necessarily optimal for this application, especially at short code lengths, which are relevant for low latency systems, IoT blockchains, etc.. In this paper, we focus on short code lengths and demonstrate that a suitable co-design of specialized LDPC codes and the light node sampling strategy can improve the probability of detection of DA attacks. We consider different adversary models based on their computational capabilities of finding stopping sets in LDPC codes. For a weak adversary model, we devise a new LDPC code construction termed as the entropy-constrained PEG (EC-PEG) algorithm which concentrates stopping sets to a small group of variable nodes. We demonstrate that the EC-PEG algorithm coupled with a greedy sampling strategy improves the probability of detection of DA attacks. For stronger adversary models, we provide a co-design of a sampling strategy called linear-programming-sampling (LP-sampling) and an LDPC code construction called linear-programming-constrained PEG (LC-PEG) algorithm. The new co-design demonstrates a higher probability of detection of DA attacks compared to approaches in earlier literature.	parity check codes;blockchains;integrated circuits;decoding;computational modeling;reed-solomon codes;low latency communication;blockchain systems;data availability attacks;ldpc codes;coded merkle tree
98	核心技术	Decentralized cross-blockchain asset transfers with transfer confirmation	Today, several solutions for cross-blockchain asset transfers exist. However, these solutions are either tailored to specific assets or neglect finality guarantees that prevent assets from getting lost in transit. In this paper, we present a cross-blockchain asset transfer protocol that supports arbitrary assets, is adaptable to different means of cross-blockchain communication, and adheres to requirements such as finality. The ability to freely transfer assets between blockchains may increase transaction throughput and provide developers with more flexibility by allowing them to design digital assets that leverage the capacities and capabilities of multiple blockchains. We define the general requirements and specifications for a cross-blockchain asset transfer protocol and provide a proof-of-concept implementation for EVM-based blockchains. Further, we evaluate the protocol concerning costs, transfer duration, and security.	blockchain interoperability;decentralized asset transfers;cross-blockchain communication;digital assets
99	实体经济	IoT-fog-based healthcare 4.0 system using blockchain technology	Real-time tracking and surveillance of patients' health has become ubiquitous in the healthcare sector as a result of the development of fog, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. Medical IoT (MIoT) equipment often transfers health data to a pharmaceutical data center, where it is saved, evaluated, and made available to relevant stakeholders or users. Fog layers have been utilized to increase the scalability and flexibility of IoT-based healthcare services, by providing quick response times and low latency. Our proposed solution focuses on an electronic healthcare system that manages both critical and non-critical patients simultaneously. Fog layer is distributed into two halves: critical fog cluster and non-critical fog cluster. Critical patients are handled at critical fog clusters for quick response, while non-critical patients are handled using blockchain technology at non-critical fog cluster, which protects the privacy of patient health records. The suggested solution requires little modification to the current IoT ecosystem while decrease the response time for critical messages and offloading the cloud infrastructure. Reduced storage requirements for cloud data centers benefit users in addition to saving money on construction and operating expenses. In addition, we examined the proposed work for recall, accuracy, precision, and F-score. The results show that the suggested approach is successful in protecting privacy while retaining standard network settings. Moreover, suggested system and benchmark are evaluated in terms of system response time, drop rate, throughput, fog, and cloud utilization. Evaluated results clearly indicate the performance of proposed system is better than benchmark.	healthcare 4;0;message scheduling;wireless sensor networksframework;edge

Firstly, the concepts of interaction consensus threshold and interaction trust threshold are defined, which are used to discriminate the interaction modes between subgroups into four categories. Corresponding hybrid feedback strategies are designed in which the consensus level and trust level of subgroups are regarded as reliable resources to facilitate the achievement of group consensus. Secondly, a minimum adjustment bidirectional feedback model considering cohesion is developed to help the interacting subgroups reach mutual consensus with minimum opinion modification. Finally, the proposed consensus framework is applied to a blockchain platform selection problem in supply chain to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the model.	social network large-group decision making;consensus;feedback mechanism;bidirectional interaction;trustscale;model;framework;set

IoT covers a wide range of topics, from simple ones like shopping and smart devices to more complex ones like automated manufacturing and the digital healthcare system. The equipment used in these fields communicates with one another over the Internet, an open platform vulnerable to security concerns. Many protocols for securing IoT communications have been devised; however, they have failed to provide the essential security strength against impersonation, replaying, intrusion and obstruction. As a result, authenticating the IoT users and safeguarding the communications carried out by IoT devices are critical. As a result, we propose a Four-Factor Mutual Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Internet of Things in this article. The Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic, the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and informal security analysis demonstrate the protocol's soundness. The protocol's robustness against multiple threats is demonstrated using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. Finally, the protocol's effectiveness in the real world is ensured through its performance evaluation.	blockchain;internet of things;four-factor authentication;elliptic curve cryptographysecure authentication;scheme;blockchain;exchange;iot;management;attack
102	核心技术	An efficient lightweight encryption model with re-encryption scheme to create robust blockchain architecture for COVID-19 data	Handling electronic health records from the Internet of Medical Things is one of the most challenging research areas as it consists of sensitive information, which targets attackers. Also, dealing with modern healthcare systems is highly complex and expensive, requiring much secured storage space. However, blockchain technology can mitigate these problems through improved health record management. The proposed work develops a scalable, lightweight framework based on blockchain technology to improve COVID-19 data security, scalability and patient privacy. Initially, the COVID-19 related data records are hashed using the enhanced Merkle tree data structure. The hashed values are encrypted by lattice based cryptography with a Homomorphic proxy re-encryption scheme in which the input data are secured. After completing the encryption process, the blockchain uses inter planetary file system to store secured information. Finally, the Proof of Work concept is utilized to validate the security of the input COVID based data records. The proposed work's experimental setup is performed using the Python tool. The performance metrics like encryption time, re-encryption time, decryption time, overall processing time, and latency prove the efficacy of the proposed schemes.	securing internet;things;privacy;systems;ehr

It is estimated that approximately 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year for different applications. This number will be doubled by 2050, which is a serious problem. The primary issue that arises in a recycling process is associated with optimum supply chain management. The comprehensive and transparent supply chain methodologies will help stockholders to make conclusive policies and precise strategies. Transparency in supply chain management assists in captivating planning, pricing, purchasing, and inventory management decisions. Environmental sustainability requires recycling, which should have innovative concepts like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Block-chain Technology. Manual methods of sorting and segregating the waste have outdated and not much efficient. The inclusion of AI and Blockchain Technology brought a revolution by increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the recycling process. This critical review focused on recycling plastics and plastic waste using AI and Blockchain Technology. Various plastic regulation policies and AI utilization for plastic recycling are discussed. An overview of the blockchain and its classification for waste management or plastic recycling has been discussed.

This is enabled by algorithms called consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-work is the most prominent consensus mechanism, but environmentally unsustainable. Here, we focus on proof-of-stake, its best-known alternative. Importantly, decentralised decision-making power is not an inherent feature of blockchain systems, but a technological possibility. Numerous security incidents illustrate that decentralised control cannot be taken for granted. We therefore study how key parameters affect the degree of decentralisation in proof-of-stake blockchain systems. Based on a real-world implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain system, we conduct agent-based simulations to study how a range of parameters impact decentralisation. The results suggest that high numbers of initial potential validator nodes, large transactions, a high number of transactions, and a very high or very low positive validator network growth rate increase decentralisation. We find weak support for an impact of changes in transaction fees and initial stake distributions. Our study highlights how blockchain challenges our understanding of decentralisation in information systems research, and contributes to understanding the governance mechanisms that lead to decentralisation in proof-of-stake blockchain systems as well as to designing proof-of-stake blockchain systems that are prone to decentralisation and therefore more secure.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;centralisation;decentralisation;decision-making power;governanceinformation-technology;governance;systems;architecture;perspective;framework;evolution
105	核心技术	Primary node election based on probabilistic linguistic term set with confidence interval in the PBFT consensus mechanism for blockchain	This study proposes a primary node election method based on probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) for the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus mechanism to effectively enhance the efficiency of reaching consensus. Specifically, a novel concept of the probabilistic linguistic term set with a confidence interval (PLTS-CI) is presented to express the uncertain complex voting information of nodes during primary node election. Then, a novel score function based on the exponential semantic value and confidence approximation value for the PLTS-CI, called Score-ESCA, is used to solve the problems of comparing different nodes with various voting attitudes. This method helps select the node with the highest score by utilizing complex decision attitudes, making it an accurate primary node election solution. Furthermore, the feasibility of our proposed method is proved by both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations.	blockchain;pbft consensus mechanism;primary node;probabilistic linguistic term set;topsisbyzantine fault-tolerance;framework;internet;reputation;algorithm;protocol;system;secure
106	核心技术	Gauze: enabling communication-friendly block synchronization with cuckoo filter	Block synchronization is an essential component of blockchain systems. Traditionally, blockchain systems tend to send all the transactions from one node to another for synchronization. However, such a method may lead to an extremely high network bandwidth overhead and significant transmission latency. It is crucial to speed up such a block synchronization process and save bandwidth consumption. A feasible solution is to reduce the amount of data transmission in the block synchronization process between any pair of peers. However, existing methods based on the Bloom filter or its variants still suffer from multiple roundtrips of communications and significant synchronization delay. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol named Gauze for fast block synchronization. It utilizes the Cuckoo filter (CF) to discern the transactions in the receiver's mempool and the block to verify, providing an efficient solution to the problem of set reconciliation in the P2P (Peer-to-Peer Network) network. By up to two rounds of exchanging and querying the CFs, the sending node can acknowledge whether the transactions in a block are contained by the receiver's mempool or not. Based on this message, the sender only needs to transfer the missed transactions to the receiver, which speeds up the block synchronization and saves precious bandwidth resources. The evaluation results show that Gauze outperforms existing methods in terms of the average processing latency (about 10x lower than Graphene) and the total synchronization space cost (about 10x lower than Compact Blocks) in different scenarios.	block synchronization;cuckoo filter;probabilistic data structureset reconciliation
107	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Credential Management for Anonymous Authentication in SAGVN	In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based collaborative credential management scheme for anonymous authentication in space-air-ground integrated vehicular networks (SAGVN), named SAG-BC. First, we build a consortium blockchain among service providers and design a distributed system setup (DSS) scheme to securely generate public parameters for issuing credentials. Second, we design a collaborative credential issuance (CCI) scheme to generate a succinct and easy-to-manage subscription credential. The credential can be used by users to access different access points in SAGVN efficiently without revealing true identities from the authentication messages. With co-designs of zero-knowledge proofs and succinct on-chain commitments, SAG-BC provides efficient verifiability and incentives for credential management operations in SAGVN. By doing so, expensive on-chain storage and computational overheads are reduced in the DSS and CCI. Finally, we conduct a thorough security analysis to demonstrate that SAG-BC achieves security and verifiability for credential management in SAGVN. We set up a real-world blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments to show the feasibility and efficiency of SAG-BC.	authentication;blockchains;antenna arrays;satellites;collaboration;base stations;wireless communication;blockchain;anonymous authentication;credential management;space-air-ground integrated vehicular networks (sagvn)distributed key generation;millimeter-wave;secure;system;protocol;design
108	核心技术	Blockchain-Envisioned Provably Secure Multivariate Identity-Based Multi-Signature Scheme for Internet of Vehicles Environment	The deployed vehicles in an Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can take intelligent decisions by means of exchanging the real-time traffic-related information between the vehicles and IoV infrastructures. This further reduces the probability of the traffic jams and accidents. However, the insecure (public) communication among the various entities in IoV makes various security threats and attacks that can be launched by passive/active adversaries present in the network. In view of this context, there is a need of an efficient cryptographic primitive which can produce single compact signature. A multi-signature scheme (MSS) empowers a collection of signers to conjointly sign a given message using a single compact signature that can be verified by any verifier. Herein, we put forward a new identity-based multivariate MSS, namely MV-MSS, which is built on top of the intractability of multivariate-quadratic (MQ) problem. The fact is that multivariate public key cryptosystem provides fast, post-quantum safe and efficient primitives, which makes it the front runner candidate among the post-quantum cryptographic candidates. MV-MSS is proven to be secure in the existential unforgeability under chosen-message and chosen identity attack model if solving the MQ problem is NP-hard. We then incorporate the designed MV-MSS in IoV application where the leader (cluster head) selected from a group of vehicles in a dynamic cluster forms the multi-signatures on the messages securely received from its member vehicles. Later, the messages along with their multi-signatures are forwarded to the nearby road-side unit (RSU) of the cluster head, which are then forwarded to a cloud server in the blockchain center maintained by a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) cloud servers network. In this way, the messages and their signatures considered as transactions are put in blocks and added into a public blockchain with the help of consensus algorithm. A comparative study among the proposed MV-MSS and other existing schemes shows that MV-MSS is efficient and secure as compared to other schemes. Finally, a blockchain implementation through simulation study has been performed to show its practical use in IoV application.	blockchains;cryptography;servers;electronic mail;roads;aggregates;vehicle dynamics;internet of vehicles (iov);identity-based cryptography;multi-signature;blockchain;consensus;securityaggregate;protocol
109	实体经济	Blockchain and IoT embedded sustainable virtual closed-loop supply chain in E-commerce towards the circular economy	Blockchain and the internet of things (IoT) have accelerated e-commerce growth and empowered online businesses to create value even in a globally competitive environment. The goal of this study is to develop a framework for the virtual closed-loop supply chain (VCLSC) that is based on novel blockchain and IoT technologies, as well as the concepts of sustainability and circular economy. This study integrates the normal and virtual supply chains into a single framework. To maximise the total expected revenue (TER) from the VCLSC, the costs of getting raw materials and parts, transporting them with a carbon emission tax, handling, processing, and making final products, refurbishing, recycling, and virtualization are all taken into account. These include running blockchain and IoT facilities, buying RFID tags, ensuring security, and storing data in blockchain in a way that cannot be changed. The above costs are captured in a single mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model. The main objective is to maximise the TER by minimising the cost of the VCLSC network. For the solution purposes, the global solver in LINGO 19 software package is used. The obtained results and performed sensitivity analysis are used to make some implications for business organisations and government administrators to create some important policies in favour of the environment, end-users, and the development of the organisation along with the nation.	blockchain;internet of things;virtual closed-loop supply chain (vclsc);network;e-commerce;circular economylogistics network design;reverse logistics;internet;things
110	协同技术	Blockchain Based Adaptive Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing	Cloud computing is breakthrough technology with applications in education, industry and research. Implementing a cloud environment, however, depends on virtualization, parallel computing, resource management, service-oriented architecture, and distributed computing. The efficiency of cloud computing depends on effective resource allocation (R-A). Conventional R-A, from resource requests to price settlement, is handled entirely by cloud service providers (CSPs), which make it difficult for end users (EUs) to view details relating to resource availability and price. Hence, an alternative technique is required to provide an efficient R-A between EU's. In this work, the blockchain (BC) technique is used for R-A between the EU's without the intervention of CSP. The BC provides decentralized and secured communication between the EU's without any inconsistency. Based on demand, R-A is carried out in two different ways, fixed size and variable size. In a fixed size R-A, each user utilizes an equal quantity of resources at a particular time but in a variable size R-A each user utilizes the varying quantity of resources based on demand. Given that the R-A, chosen depends on resource availability and demand, the proposed work employs hybrid R-A (Adaptive Resource Allocation) schemes such as fixed-size adaptive R-A (FSARA) and variable-sized adaptive R-A (VSARA). The simulation results show the comparative analysis of the proposed and existing R-A techniques. When compared to existing R-A techniques like optimal, greedy and iterative techniques, the proposed technique achieved more 90% customer satisfaction. Depends on priority the allocated resource price is varied in a proposed provides equal profit (50%) to R-R and R-P. When compared to existing random transmission technique, the proposed technique takes lesser than 8.5% of transmission time. The proposed technique reduces transmission latency, confirmation latency, and response time, while simultaneously increasing throughput and R-A scalability without CSP intervention.	resource allocation;smart contract;blockchain;fixed and variable size resource allocation

This research note suggests four propositions of metaverse tourism. First, the core technologies of metaverse tourism will lead to a new level of immersive experiences. Second, metaverse tourists can develop more realistic expectations in the pre-trip stage. Third, researchers should consider metaverse tourist's multi-identification profiles. Lastly, metaverse tourism offers the new business model of a creative economy. As such, the research note suggests that tourism researchers begin to understand the metaverse tourism ecosystem and investigate the metaverse tourism experience of the pre-, during-, and post-travel stages to create precise research ideas.	metaverse tourism;immersive experience;multi-identification profile;technologyavatars
112	虚拟经济	Who really needs a Metaverse in anatomy education? A review with preliminary survey results	The term Metaverse ("meta" defined as beyond, transcendence or virtuality, and "verse" meaning universe or world) denotes a "virtual reality space" for anatomy teaching. To ascertain how many anatomists are familiar or are using this adjunct in teaching, we conducted a short survey at the 2022 annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA). Interestingly, only six respondents (9.4%) had used a Metaverse for teaching anatomy. Moreover, the vast majority of attendees were anatomy educators or basic science faculty, but not practicing physicians/surgeons or other actively practicing health care professionals; a group where this technology has been used much more commonly. The present manuscript was authored by anatomy educators, practicing physicians and other actively practicing health care professionals with backgrounds in diverse medical fields, that is, anatomists, medical doctors, physician assistants, dentists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, chiropractors, veterinarians, and medical students. Many of these authors have used or have been exposed to a Metaverse in the clinical realm. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to better understand those who are knowledgeable of a Metaverse and its use in anatomy education, and to provide ways forward for using such technology in this discipline.	anatomy;augmented reality;cadaver;covid-19;diversity;education;metaverse;mixed reality;pandemic;survey;virtual realityvirtual-reality
113	市场治理	Volatility Interdependence Between Cryptocurrencies, Equity, and Bond Markets	This paper investigates (i) the return-volatility spillover between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin, (ii) the interdependence between cryptocurrencies' volatility and the US equity and bond markets' volatility, and (iii) the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on the cryptocurrencies' return-volatility. A two-step estimation approach is considered where Univariate General Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic models are estimated to model the volatility of the four cryptocurrencies then a Simultaneous Equation Model is estimated to model the interconnection between the cryptocurrency volatilities, the US equity and bond markets' volatility, and Covid-19 outbreak. We show that return-volatility spillovers exist among Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin while Ripple is the main transmitter of shocks. We find that the cryptocurrency market is detached from the US stock market but not from the US bond market. Finally, we show that a high economic and financial uncertainty in the US stock market due to pandemic outbreaks affects the price of Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. However, shocks are short-lived. Our findings have practical implications; as the evidence of volatility spillovers among cryptocurrencies and their relative isolation from the majority of mainstream assets should be factored into the valuation and portfolio diversification strategies of investors. In crisis times such as those induced by Covid-19, investors who seek protection from downward movements in bond markets could benefit from taking a position in Ethereum. Policymakers can also rely on our findings to time their intervention to stabilize markets and control uncertainties inherent to stressful periods.	cryptocurrencies;volatility spillover;garch-sem;structural breaks;pandemicssafe haven;bitcoin;return;persistence;connectedness;transmission;uncertainty;commodities;spillovers;dynamics
114	市场治理	A new hybrid machine learning model for predicting the bitcoin (BTC-USD) price	Several machine learning techniques and hybrid architectures for predicting bitcoin price movement have been presented in the past. Our paper proposes a hybrid model encompassing classification and regression models for predicting bitcoin prices. Our analysis found that the automated feature interactions learner (deep cross networks) error performance using a plethora of technical indicators, including crypto-specific technical indicator difficulty ribbon compression and control variables such as Metcalfe's value of bitcoin, number of unique active addresses, bitcoin network hash rate, and S & P 500 log returns, in a hybrid architecture is better than the single-stage architecture. The hybrid model predicted a 100% directional hit rate and maintained steady volatility in returns for the out-of-sample period. Our paper concludes that in terms of risk (Sharpe ratio 1.03) and profitability (260% and 82%), the hybrid model's bitcoin futures strategy performed better than the deep cross network regression and buy-and-hold benchmark strategies.

115	市场治理	The connectedness and risk spillovers between bitcoin spot and futures markets: evidence from intraday data	This paper examines the dynamic relation between Bitcoin spot and futures markets during the Covid-19 pandemic. Using hourly data from 2020 combined with quantile impulse response analysis and predictability in the distribution test, we attempt to ascertain whether spot or futures markets lead in the price discovery process under a variety of market conditions. Granger predictability based on the left tail, the right tail, and the center of the distribution show bidirectional predictability between spot and futures markets suggesting significant feedback effects following normal and extreme gains/losses where neither market dominates in price discovery. Using a CAViaR model and the associated impulse response functions with estimates for dynamic tail dependence, we document spillovers between quantiles of spot and futures returns. Estimates of impulse response functions at various risk levels show the futures market has an edge in influencing the spot market and figures more prominently in the price discovery process.	bitcoin returns;cryptocurrencies;futures markets;risk spillovers;information flowslead-lag relationship;value-at-risk;price discovery;volatility spillover;index futures;stock;exchange;models;determinants;dependence
116	市场治理	Comovement and instability in cryptocurrency markets	We analyze the extent of comovement between daily price returns of nine major cryptocurren-cies from April 2013 to February 2021. We assess its evolution using bivariate and multivariate modeling approaches, and detect pronounced time variation. Generally, comovement is initially low and positive, but increases substantially between early 2017 and late 2018 and stays high until the end of the sample. We then adopt a right-tail version of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test to identify periods of mildly explosive behavior (statistical instability) in the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio of seven cryptocurrencies. The NVT ratio is a novel measure of the dollar value of cryptocurrency transaction activity relative to network value. We show evidence of significant mild explosiveness in all seven cryptocurrencies. In 2018 and in the second half of 2019, several cryptocurrencies experience often simultaneous instability. Instability is a dominant feature of these markets.	mild explosiveness;nvt ratio;comovement;asset pricing;cryptocurrenciessafe haven;bitcoin;bubbles;inefficiency;investment;returns;index;hedge
117	技术治理	A Comprehensive Review of Denial of Service Attacks in Blockchain Ecosystem and Open Challenges	With the proliferation of the blockchain technology ecosystems such as mining pools, crypto exchanges, full Bitcoin nodes, wallets, and pool protocol servers in recent years, the denial of service (DoS) attack vector has become more prevalent, and the attacks are targeted to the peer-to-peer networks and blockchain users. Despite blockchain enhancing security with decentralized design, secured distributed storage, and privacy, it is still vulnerable to new attack threats. If an attempted DoS is successful on blockchain, the impact is most likely massive given the fact that it is predominantly used for finance applications. An extensive account of the current state-of-the-art for possible DoS and corresponding mitigation techniques is not discussed in the existing research. This paper analyzes and categorizes the existing state-of-the-art DoS attack methods, detection techniques, and mitigation solutions targeting blockchain peer-to-peer networks as well as conventional network crypto exchanges. The review of the prior research shows that the blockchain ecosystem can be a target to successfully perform DoS attacks in the future, and technological advancements in blockchain are needed to mitigate potential attacks.	blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;bitcoin;distributed ledger;ecosystems;security;medical services;smart contracts;denial-of-service attack;cryptocurrencies;denial of service;blockchain;smart contract;ethereum;mining pool;crypto exchange;network securityddos attacks;security;privacy
118	实体经济	Decentralized platform economy: emerging blockchain-based decentralized platform business models	Emerging decentralized multisided platforms aim to create more open collaborations between participants and question currently centralized networked business models, such as Google, Amazon, Uber, or Airbnb. In this paper, a systematic analysis of the emerging decentralized platform economy is presented based on blockchain technology. The research aims to fill a gap in the literature, as there is currently no specific analyses on these emerging multisided decentralized electronic markets. Eighty-two decentralized platforms were studied. The study contributes to the literature on decentralized platform taxonomy to structure the emerging research domain of decentralized platform business models. Applying a cluster analysis, three emerging archetypes of decentralized platforms were found, referred to as hosted, federated, and shared platform models. The research contributes to a better understanding of emerging decentralized business platforms. According to the findings, two-thirds of the analyzed platforms, namely, federated and shared archetypes, do not follow traditional models. Rather, their aim is to create new business and community relationships. Furthermore, the archetype of shared platforms is the most disruptive, showing a higher level of decentralization and business model change.	blockchain;business models;decentralized platforms;decentralized business;disruptive technology;web3technologies;impact
119	核心技术	A Dynamic Reputation-based Consensus Mechanism for Blockchain	In recent years, Blockchain is gaining prominence as a hot topic in academic research. However, the consensus mechanism of blockchain has been criticized in terms of energy consumption and performance. Although Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, as a lightweight consensus mechanism, is more efficient than traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS), it suffers from the problem of centralization. To this end, on account of analyzing the shortcomings of existing consensus mechanisms, this paper proposes a dynamic reputation-based consensus mechanism for blockchain. This scheme allows nodes with reputation value higher than a threshold apply to become amonitoring node, which canmonitor the behavior of validators in case that validators with excessive power cause harm to the blockchain network. At the same time, the reputation evaluation algorithm is also introduced to select nodes with high reputation to become validators in the network, thus increasing the cost of malicious behavior. In each consensus cycle, validators and monitoring nodes are dynamically updated according to the reputation value. Through security analysis, it is demonstrated that the scheme can resist the attacks of malicious nodes in the blockchain network. By simulation experiments and analysis of the scheme, the result verifies that the mechanism can effectively improve the fault tolerance of the consensus mechanism, reduce the time of consensus to guarantee the security of the system.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;proof-of-authority;reputation evaluationinternet;model

121	实体经济	Information Dissemination Model in Rural Live Broadcasting under Blockchain in the Era of Artificial Intelligence	This work aims to improve the information dissemination atmosphere of rural live broadcasting and ensure its long-term development. First, it studies and analyzes the current situation and characteristics of rural live broadcasting. Then, it discusses the blockchain (BC) technology and information dissemination mode in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, the characteristics of BC technology (BT) and the information dissemination model are discussed. A BT-optimized susceptible exposed infected recovered (SEIR) information dissemination model is proposed. The results show that the BT-optimized SEIR model has no effect on the traditional information transmission characteristics and can ensure the conventional transmission of all information. Additionally, BT can effectively improve the overall transmission efficiency of the SEIR model for false information and accurate information and effectively shorten the duration. Specifically, the BT-optimized SEIR model's maximum false information transmission proportion is reduced by about 13%. The duration is reduced by 15 days over the traditional model. By comparison, in positive information dissemination, the maximum transmission proportion of the proposed BT-optimized SEIR model is about 19% higher than the traditional model. The duration is about 30 days longer. The research provides technical support for controlling and improving the current situation and atmosphere of rural live broadcasting information dissemination.

To improve the efficiency of machine learning, people realize efficient data classification by supporting the ML model, namely, the support vector machine (SVM) model, which is used in the realization of linear classification. However, data security and data protection are not addressed in SVM classifier training from multiple entity-labeled IoT data. In the existing solution, they depend on the implicit hypothesis that learning data can be dependable collected from complex data providers, which is often not the reality. To solve the question between the above problems, in this article, we put forward a secure support vector machine-a secure SECURE SVM training scheme for protecting the privacy on encrypted IoT data based on blockchain. Firstly, a secure and dependable data encryption sharing platform is established among complex data providers by using blockchain technology, which is recorded in a distributed ledger. Secondly, the homomorphic cryptosystem is used to design secure components, and the secure polynomial multiplication is improved to design a secure SVM training algorithm, which only needs two interactions in one iteration and does not need a trusted third party. Finally, the experimental results display that the plan ensures the confidentiality of sensitive data of each data provider and the confidentiality and validity of SVM model parameters of data analysts.	classification;framework;machine

Most of the existing works in IoT-assisted healthcare application execution do not consider the energy harvesting, computation task allocation, trust access authentication of users, and quality of service (QoS) requirements satisfaction at the same time by investigating different healthcare users, requirements, energy cost, available cloud, and network resources. To deal with these issues, this paper proposes an intelligent energy harvesting, decentralised blockchain-based authentication, and QoS-aware healthcare task coordination scheme for IoT-assisted healthcare applications by taking into account different users, QoS requirements, resources availability, and resource cost. Simulation results on transaction delay, energy consumption, resource cost, throughput, and system reward are presented to show the significance of the proposed scheme over the conventional schemes.	blockchain;bc;energy harvesting;eh;task coordination;healthcare;internet of things;iot;quality of service;qosaccess-control;security;authentication;environment;internet
125	实体经济	A Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework Reference Architecture for Better Semantic Interoperability Based on Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT	Due to the distributed and non-integrated nature of the healthcare systems which results from the application-centric view it leads to a challenging task to manage healthcare data exchange (heterogeneity problem). On the other hand, Blockchain technologies are emerging as promising and cost-effective means to meet some of these requirements due to their inherent design properties, such as secure cryptography and a resilient peer-to-peer network. Likewise, Blockchain-based applications can benefit the healthcare domain via their properties of asset sharing, and audit trails of data access. Existing work mainly pays attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But it doesn't realize the increase need for better data interoperability amount multiple healthcare systems and services. This requires shifting from the application-centric solutions toward the patient-centric solutions. This paper presents A secure and efficient framework based on Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT named Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework (PCH) for better healthcare systems interoperability. A tiered-based architecture (5 tiers) with collaboration is designed for the feasible realization of PCH. Also, the design and implementation aspects start from the layering diagram, system context, and detailed reference architecture that emphasizes the detailed component topology and interactions within the framework. An electronic medical record is used to show how healthcare data is processed with the required security considerations. Then, an evaluation of PCH against the existing Blockchain-based healthcare frameworks is conducted. The results analysis demonstrates that PCH offers practical solutions to protect healthcare data and support efficient data sharing with better interoperability.	blockchains;medical services;distributed ledger;interoperability;computer architecture;security;data privacy;blockchain;chaincode;digital health;distributed ledger technology (dlt);ehealth;ehrs sharing;electronic health records (ehrs);endorsement;fabric;health information exchange;hyperledger;ordering service;smart contracts
126	虚拟经济	Comparative Analysis of Decentralized Identity Approaches	Decentralization is essential when trust and performance must not depend on a single organization. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and Decentralized Hash Tables (DHTs) are examples where the DLT is useful for transactional events, and the DHT is useful for large-scale data storage. The combination of these two technologies can meet many challenges. The blockchain is a DLT with immutable history protected by cryptographic signatures in data blocks. Identification is an essential issue traditionally provided by centralized trust anchors. Self-sovereign identities (SSIs) are proposed decentralized models where users can control and manage their identities with the help of DHT. However, slowness is a challenge among decentralized identification systems because of many connections and requests among participants. In this article, we focus on decentralized identification by DLT and DHT, where users can control their information and store biometrics. We survey some existing alternatives and address the performance challenge by comparing different decentralized identification technologies based on execution time and throughput. We show that the DHT and machine learning model (BioIPFS) performs better than other solutions such as uPort, ShoCard, and BBID.	blockchains;cloud computing;internet;decentralized applications;social networking (online);distributed ledger;privacy;identification;decentralization;distributed hash table;self-sovereign identitymanagement
127	实体经济	International Logistics Management System Based on Cloud Computing Technology	In order to solve the problems of slow matching between supply and demand, information authenticity and security, and lack of trust in traditional logistics platforms, the author proposes an international logistics management system based on cloud computing technology. The system uses blockchain as the underlying technology, combined with related technologies such as smart contracts and NSGA-II algorithms, matches the supply and demand sides of cross-border logistics resources, writes the important information generated in the platform transaction into the blockchain, and carries out network-wide broadcast and consensus, so as to realize the intelligence of the transaction and the nontampering and traceability of the information. The experiment found that in the case set by this example, max Z(1) = 57.139, and max Z(2) = 54.679, meaning that the final matching result is as follows: P2, the cross-border logistics provider, is matched with U5, the consignor; P3 matches U9, P8 matches U4, P9 matches U3, P1 matches U6, P5 matches U1, P7 matches U2, P4 matches U7, P10 matches U8, and P8 matches U10. Satisfactory matching results show that the algorithm is effective. Experimental results show that the system can increase the transparency and sharing of cross-border logistics information, help to reduce forged data information, improve the level of automation and intelligence, and provide a reference for the application of blockchain technology in the field of cross-border logistics.	
128	协同技术	Differential Privacy-Based Double Auction for Data Market in Blockchain-Enhanced Internet of Things	With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), large amounts of data are collected, which constitute a valuable business resource. Hence, a suitable IoT data market needs to be established, and the provision of safe and effective trading services for multiple buyers and sellers is required. This paper introduces an IoT data market framework supported by blockchain. It focuses on a transaction realization scheme for multiple buyers and sellers. In the scheme, the mechanisms are designed to determine the corresponding data providers and recipients for the buyers and sellers, respectively, and the transaction prices of both parties. When the data market runs, an inference attack will raise bid information leakage issues. We study a transaction scheme that enables differential privacy protection of bids based on an exponential mechanism. This paper theoretically proves the individual rationality, weak budget balance, and truthfulness of the normal transaction scheme and differential privacy-based transaction scheme. This paper also theoretically proves the effectiveness of the differential privacy protection for bids of transaction participants. Furthermore, this paper verifies the performances of the two schemes through digital simulation experiments. From the experiments, we can also prove that these schemes occupy reasonable social welfare and computational overhead.	iot
129	实体经济	Distributed Ledger Technology Based Architecture for Decentralized Device-to-Device Communication Network	Due to the mobility of devices, device-to-device (D2D) communication is a promising fifth-generation (5G) technology in dynamic environments for improving message transmission efficiency for group communication. Additionally, all services in an ad hoc network are current Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) applications. Therefore, D2D communication has been introduced in ad hoc environments to reduce latency during vehicle conversations, such as autonomous vehicle solutions and drone fleet management for cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) modules and Internet of Drones (IoDs) networks. However, providing secure and effective group communication is an urgent challenge. To solve these problems, we propose a dynamic group management solution based on distributed ledger technology. This study demonstrates that a distributed ledger-based hierarchical architecture for dynamic group management is faster and more adaptable without compromising security and performance. Furthermore, the proposed method can facilitate the transfer of direct communication data without a centralized database, thereby reducing the chance of a single point of failure.

131	技术治理	New Blockchain Based Special Keys Security Model With Path Compression Algorithm for Big Data	In recent years, following the introduction of the IoT (Internet of Things) into our lives and thanks to the rapidly increasing number of digital applications, data is collected from a wide variety of sources at an astonishing rate, and the amount of data is increasing exponentially. Today, social networks, cloud computing and data analytics make it possible to collect huge amounts of data. The concept of big data has subsequently emerged and is an important topic in many fields. However, it is not only very difficult to store big data and analyze it, but it is also a serious threat to the security of an individual's sensitive information. This study describes the issues surrounding big data security and privacy, and provides a solution involving a new blockchain-based security model. This proposed model is called the Blockchain-based Special Key Security Model (BSKM). BSKM proposes, implements and integrates three elements (confidentiality, integrity and availability) of information security together for big data. With this proposed model, a more practical and flexible structure is established for all operations (read, write, update and delete) performed on a database with real data. In this study performed with a special key, all separate blockchain transactions were used for read, write, update and delete operations, and there was a structure that could ensure both confidentiality and integrity at the same time. By looking at a special key for all the blockchain transaction operations performed on the big data it has been shown what type of authorization and access control can be established between which processes and which users. Thus, in contrast to previous studies seen in published literature, data confidentiality, data integrity and data consistency were guaranteed for all transactions. The results of the proposed BSKM model have also been compared by conducting an experimental study of its application. Moreover, this study has shown the effectiveness and benefits of the path compression algorithm. This result has been shown with experimental studies modeling big data and also shows promise for further studies.	big data;security;blockchains;data privacy;data models;medical diagnostic imaging;authorization;privacy;big data;blockchain;path compression;privacy;security
132	技术治理	Trustworthiness Evaluation for Permissioned Blockchain-Enabled Applications	As permissioned blockchain becomes a common foundation of blockchain-based circumstances for current organizations, related stakeholders need a means to assess the trustworthiness of the applications involved within. It is extremely important to consider the potential impact brought by the Blockchain technology in terms of security and privacy. Therefore, this study proposes a rigorous security risk management framework for permissioned blockchain-enabled applications. The framework divides itself into different implementation domains, i.e., organization security, application security, consensus mechanism security, node management and network security, host security and perimeter security, and simultaneously provides guidelines to control the security risks of permissioned blockchain applications with respect to these security domains. In addition, a case study, including a security testing and risk evaluation on each stack of a specific organization, is demonstrated as an implementation instruction of our proposed risk management framework. According to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the pioneer researches that provide a means to evaluate the security risks of permissioned blockchain applications from a holistic point of view. If users can trust the applications that adopted this framework, this study can contribute to the adoption of permissioned blockchain-enabled technologies. Furthermore, application providers can use the framework to perform gap analysis on their existing systems and controls and understand the risks of their applications.	permissioned blockchain;blockchain security;blockchain risk evaluation
133	技术治理	A Survey on Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Technologies for Enhancing Security and Privacy in Smart Environments	Smart environments consist of a collection of sensors, actuators, and numerous computing units that improve human life. With the booming of smart environments, data generation has been notably increasing in recent years, which must be managed in a smart and optimal manner. The components (i.e., workstations and cloud) used for data processing are not the best to recommend since it is risky and resource costing. For that matter, enterprises, firms and companies are deploying blockchain technologies (BT) as a more suitable alternative. In fact, blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger ensuring the reliability and transparency of data. However, BT faces some inherent security challenges such as DoS, eclipse and double spending attacks as well as Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and malware. Thus, advanced anomaly detection and mitigation approaches, especially the ones using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques (e. g. Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Federated Learning) are required to address the aforementioned issues. In combination, AI and BT are capable of detecting anomalies within blockchain networks with high accuracy. In this paper, with a focus on cyber security issues, we explore the challenges of blockchain deployment in smart environments. Additionally, we explore the use of anomaly detection AI-based techniques as a ledger of blockchain technologies to address the security issues in smart environments. Thus, we propose a framework that emphasizes the challenges of BT, values and capabilities of BT-AI integration. We also present research trends to highlight potential research paths for improving the security of blockchain networks using artificial intelligence.	blockchain technology;artificial intelligence;security and privacy;smart environments;machine learning;anomaly detectionchallenges;internet;support;issues;things;iot
134	技术治理	Circuit: A JavaScript Memory Heap-Based Approach for Precisely Detecting Cryptojacking Websites	Cryptojacking is often used by attackers as a means of gaining profits by exploiting users' resources without their consent, despite the anticipated positive effect of browser-based cryptomining. Previous approaches have attempted to detect cryptojacking websites, but they have the following limitations: (1) they failed to detect several cryptojacking websites either because of their evasion techniques or because they cannot detect JavaScript-based cryptojacking and (2) they yielded several false alarms by focusing only on limited characteristics of cryptojacking, such as counting computer resources. In this paper, we propose CIRCUIT, a precise approach for detecting cryptojacking websites. We primarily focuse on the JavaScript memory heap, which is resilient to script code obfuscation and provides information about the objects declared in the script code and their reference relations. We then extract a reference flow that can represent the script code behavior of the website from the JavaScript memory heap. Hence, CIRCUIT determines that a website is running cryptojacking if it contains a reference flow for cryptojacking. In our experiments, we found 1,813 real-world cryptojacking websites among 300K popular websites. Moreover, we provided new insights into cryptojacking by modeling the identified evasion techniques and considering the fact that characteristics of cryptojacking websites now appear on normal websites as well.	codes;computer security;cryptocurrency;engines;instruction sets;behavioral sciences;syntactics;cyberattack;browsers;browser security;web security;cryptojacking
135	协同技术	A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL BASED ON HETEROGENEOUS DATA	Big data is widely used in many areas of business. The information between organizations is systematically reproduced and processed by data, and the collected data differs significantly in attributes. By composing heterogeneous data sets, they complement each other, therefore, data exchange between organizations is necessary. In a machine learning collaborative learning process based on heterogeneous data, the current schema has many challenges, including efficiency, security, and availability in real-world situations. In this paper, we propose a secure SVM learning mechanism based on the consortium blockchain and a threshold homomorphic encryption algorithm. By implementing the consortium's blockchain, it is possible to build a decentralized data exchange platform, and also to develop a secure algorithm for the support-vector machine classifier based on threshold homomorphic encryption.	blockchain;heterogeneous data;svm;secure scheme
136	核心技术	A Scalable Double-Chain Storage Module for Blockchain	With the growing maturity of blockchain technology, its peer-to-peer model and fully duplicated data storage pattern enable blockchain to act as a distributed ledger in untrustworthy environments. Blockchain storage has also become a research hotspot in industry, finance, and academia due to its security, and its unique data storage management model is gradually becoming a key technology to play its value in various fields' applications. However, with the increasing amount of data written into the blockchain, the blockchain system faces many problems in its actual implementation of the application, such as high storage space occupation, low data flexibility and availability, low retrieval efficiency, poor scalability, etc. To improve the above problems, this paper combines off-chain storage technology and deduplication technology to optimize the blockchain storage model. Firstly, this paper adopts the double-chain model to reduce the data storage of the major chain system, which stores a small amount of primary data and supervises the vice chain through an Application Programming Interface (API). The vice chain stores a large number of copies of data as well as non-transactional data. Our model divides the vice chain storage system into two layers, including a storage layer and a processing layer. In the processing layer, deduplication technology is applied to reduce the redundancy of vice chain data. Our double-chain storage model with high scalability enhances data flexibility, is more suitable as a distributed storage system, and performs well in data retrieval.	blockchain;storage model;off-chain storage;de-duplicationscheme;security;model

140	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based Self-Tallying Voting Protocol With Maximum Voter Privacy	The development of secure and reliable voting mechanism has attracted more and more attention from academia and industry. Many researchers are trying to design a secure and reliable voting system. However, many existing blockchain-based proposals have more or less problems, such as limited number of participants, weak fault-tolerant mechanisms and inadequate privacy protection, which makes it difficult to apply them to the real world to solve the above problems. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol to achieve high available, secure and anonymous voting. More specifically, we adopt threshold secret sharing to deal with abstention problem (this is a difficult problem to solve in self-tallying voting systems). We adopt homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof to achieve anonymity and verifiability of encrypted data. Through the analysis and performance testing, and comparison with existing similar proposals, the results show that our scheme has advantages in security and robustness, and the performance test shows that our scheme has good practicability and scalability.	e-voting;zero-knowledge proof;homomorphic encryption;blockchain;cryptography

142	协同技术	Communication-Efficient and Cross-Chain Empowered Federated Learning for Artificial Intelligence of Things	Conventional machine learning approaches aggregate all training data in a central server, which causes massive communication overhead of data transmission and is also vulnerable to privacy leakage. Thereby, blockchain-based federated learning has emerged to protect Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices from exposing their private data by the Federated Learning (FL) framework, and also enables decentralized model training without the vulnerability of a central server. However, the existing blockchain-based FL systems still suffer from (i) limited scalability of the single blockchain framework; and (ii) large communication costs incurred by iterative large-size model update transmission. To this end, we first design an efficient cross-chain framework for scalable and flexible model training management, in which multiple blockchains are customized for specific FL tasks and individually perform learning tasks for privacy protection. A cross-chain scheme is proposed to enable secure blockchain collaboration and interactions for efficient model training, model trading, and payment. We then propose a flexible model update compression scheme to save communication costs almost without compromising accuracy. Moreover, for model trading markets, we design a dynamic pricing scheme using machine learning-based auction for model trading. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework and schemes achieve scalable, flexible, and communication-efficient decentralized FL systems in AIoT.	blockchains;training;task analysis;data models;6g mobile communication;quantization (signal);servers;federated learning;cross-chain;gradient compression and quantization;artificial intelligence of thingsblockchain;framework;network
143	协同技术	Trustworthy Transaction Spreading Using Node Reliability Estimation in IoT Blockchain Networks	Featured Application Blockchain-powered IoT Applications, such as agricultural applications, logistics, and smart factory data management. Blockchain network architecture is a promising technology for constructing highly secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks. IoT networks typically comprise various sensors and actuators. Blockchain network technology can be applied to secure control robots in smart factories or reliable drone deliveries in smart cities. The wide spread of transactions and shared smart contracts across blockchain networks guarantees ultimate network security. A typical wired blockchain network maintains sufficient redundancy within a stable configuration. However, IoT blockchain networks exhibit unavoidable instability. The dynamic configuration changes caused by flexible node membership make it impossible to achieve the same level of redundancy as a stable network. A trustworthy transaction spreading method provides practical transaction sharing for dynamic IoT networks. We propose a Q-learning framework and a graph convergence network (GCN) to search for the proper spreading path of each transaction. The proposed Q-learning framework determines the next spreading hop using node features. The GCN determines the reliable area based on the Q-learning results. The discovered reliable area guides the proper spreading path of transactions to the destination node. In addition, the proposed trustworthy transaction spreading was implemented over an InterPlanetary File system (IPFS). The IPFS-powered experiments confirmed the practicability of the proposed transaction spreading mechanism.	iot blockchain;q-learning;gcn;ipfsprotocol
144	协同技术	On Sidechain-Assisted Transaction Service Management for Internet of Things: A Random Contract Approach	With the evolution of industrial technologies, the Internet of Things and blockchain show enormous potential. Different institutes with heterogeneous devices indicate diversity in their private information, including service demand and risk-bearing capability. Low efficiency and rising transaction prices of the public blockchain have been significant barriers to these potential service purchasers. The sidechain is recognized as one of the scalability solutions to a public chain. However, it is challenging to design the economic incentive mechanism and study the transaction fee pricing for transaction services on a sidechain due to the uncertainty of the network's performance and the miner's effort. Considering the asymmetric information (i.e., anonymous private information) and uncertainty, we propose a random-contract-based scheme to maximize the sidechain service provider's revenue and assign the service buyers the feasible service price under the framework of a sidechain linked to the public blockchain. Furthermore, we show that random contracts outperform the deterministic contracts under the increasing absolute risk-aversion assumption. We investigate service pricing in various scenarios using Geometric Brownian Motion. The simulation findings reveal that random contracts can increase the sidechain's revenue by 24.70%, compared with deterministic contracts. The efficient service payments have been reduced by 44.65%, compared with the main chain's cost.	blockchains;internet of things;contracts;smart cities;resource management;uncertainty;industries;internet of things;random contract;contract theory;blockchain;sidechainblockchain;mechanism;design
145	协同技术	Blockchain-Assisted Distributed Fog Computing Control Flow Attestation	The control flow hijacking attack poses a serious threat to the integrity of the software. The attacker exploits the loophole to hijack the control flow of the running program to achieve the purpose of the attack. Remote control flow attestation is a method for embedded devices to ensure the integrity of the software. With the continuous development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, embedded devices have exploded. None of the existing control flow attestation schemes can adapt to the real-time attestation requests of such massive embedded devices. This paper proposes a blockchain-assisted distributed fog computing control flow attestation scheme BDFCFA to deal with this scenario. The scheme uses a simplified control flow representation model, which can effectively represent the control flow of the program and reduce the runtime overhead of the prover in the attestation process. We use SGX technology to protect the integrity and confidentiality of verifier and prover data during the attestation process. Our proposed bidirectional control flow attestation protocol based on the elliptic curve can greatly protect the communication security between verifiers and provers without incurring excessive performance overhead and communication cost. We evaluate the performance of BDFCFA through the SNU real-time benchmark and demonstrate that BDFCFA has better performance. Finally, compared to the existing remote control flow attestation scheme, the results show that BDFCFA has the highest security.	authentication

However, this industry has also gained attention from adversaries who exploit users' computers to mine cryptocurrency covertly. To detect cryptojacking attacks, many static and dynamic methods are proposed. However, the existing solutions still have some limitations in terms of effectiveness, performance, and transparency. To address these issues, we present CJSpector, a novel hardware-based approach for cryptojacking detection. This method first leverages the Intel Processor Trace mechanism to collect the run-time control flow information of a web browser. Next, CJSpector makes use of two optimization approaches based on the library functionality and information gain to preprocess the control flow information. Finally, it leverages Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for cryptojacking detection. The evaluation shows that our method can detect in-browser covert cryptocurrency mining effectively and transparently with a small performance cost.	cryptojacking detection;control flow;intel processor trace;rnn
148	实体经济	Cooperative Spectrum Sensing and Fusion Based on Tangle Networks	Cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is a promising solution to improve the spectrum sensing performance. However, some cooperative secondary users (SUs) may intentionally send wrong spectrum sensing results for the benefit of themselves, which will bring security problems to the CSS-enabled systems. Besides, the behavior of the primary user (PU) may change dynamically when SUs sense the spectrum, which affects the accuracy of CSS. In this paper, a CSS architecture based on the Tangle blockchain is proposed, where massive mobile devices (MDs) act as spectrum sensing nodes and blockchain nodes. A novel dynamic spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed based on the mean-field game. A two-step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism based on the age of information (AoI) and cumulative weight (CW) of transactions is proposed to address the impact of perceptual data differences on the overall decision. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional fixed spectrum sensing strategy, the MDs' weighted sensing utility in the proposed dynamic spectrum sensing scheme is improved by 10% on average. Moreover, compared to the traditional maximal ratio combining fusion mechanism, the detection probability of the proposed two-step spectrum sensing fusion mechanism is maximally increased by 30.23%, and the false alarm probability is minimally reduced by 9.92%.	sensors;blockchains;games;wireless networks;heuristic algorithms;throughput;information age;age of information;cooperative spectrum sensing;mean field game;sensing fusion;tanglecognitive radio networks;cellular networks;optimization;load

156	市场治理	Adoption of Blockchain Technology: Exploring the Factors Affecting Organizational Decision	Blockchain (BCT) is an emerging technology that promises many benefits for organizations, for instance, disintermediation, data security, data transparency, a single version of the truth, and trust among trading partners. Despite its multiple benefits, the adoption rate of BCT among organizations has not reached a significantly high level worldwide, thus requiring further research in this space. The present study addresses this issue in the Australian context. There is a knowledge gap in what specific factors, among the plethora of factors reported in the extant literature, affect the organizational adoption of BCT in Australia. To fill this gap, the study uses the qualitative interpretative research approach along with the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework as a theoretical lens. The data was mainly drawn from the literature review and semi-structured interviews of the decision-makers and senior IT people from the BCT adopter and potential adopter organizations in Australia. According to the findings, perceived information transparency, perceived risks, organization innovativeness, organization learning capability, standards uncertainty, and competition intensity influence organizational adoption of BCT in Australia. These factors are exclusively identified in this study. The study also validates the influence of perceived benefits and perceived compatibility on BCT adoption that are reported in the past studies. Practically, these findings are helpful for the Australian government and public and private organizations to develop better policies and make informed decisions for the organizational adoption of BCT. The findings would guide decision-makers to think about the adoption of BCT strategically. The study also has theoretical implications explained in the discussion section.	supply chain;innovation
157	实体经济	GT-Chain: A Fair Blockchain for Intelligent Industrial IoT Applications	In Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a number of mutually untrusted devices with diverse computing resources and application requirements often need to work together to serve industrial production. When applying permissionless blockchain to process transactions among these devices, we are concerned with two types of fairness: mining fairness (i.e., miners should obtain commensurate rewards according to their respective invested computing power) and transaction-processing fairness (i.e., transaction packing and confirming is in a desired fair order). To address the two types of fairness simultaneously, this paper proposes GT-Chain, in which miners select transactions according to Geometric-distribution and propagate transactions with a Time-to-live limit for achieving transaction-processing fairness as well as balancing the processing efficiency and fairness. Besides, GT-Chain inherits properties of a famous blockchain called FruitChain for achieving mining fairness. We then conduct a probability analysis to quantify the efficiency of transaction processing and define a Euclidean-distance-based fair degree to measure the fairness of transaction processing. Extensive simulations verify that GT-Chain can well achieve our design objectives, and our theoretical model is accurate. This paper is helpful in better designing blockchain protocols for IIoT.	blockchains;industrial internet of things;peer-to-peer computing;data mining;urban areas;sensors;resource management;gt-chain;blockchain;fair;intelligent;industrial iotinternet;system;cloud;edge
158	协同技术	Performance Analysis of Storage Systems in Edge Computing Infrastructures	Edge computing constitutes a promising paradigm of managing and processing the massive amounts of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Data and computation are moved closer to the client, thus enabling latency- and bandwidth-sensitive applications. However, the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the edge as well as its limited resource capabilities pose several challenges in implementing or choosing an efficient edge-enabled storage system. Therefore, it is imperative for the research community to contribute to the clarification of the purposes and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of various edge-enabled storage systems. This work aspires to contribute toward this direction by presenting a performance analysis of three different storage systems, namely MinIO, BigchainDB, and the IPFS. We selected these three systems as they have been proven to be valid candidates for edge computing infrastructures. In addition, as the three evaluated systems belong to different types of storage, we evaluated a wide range of storage systems, increasing the variability of the results. The performance evaluation is performed using a set of resource utilization and Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. Each storage system is deployed and installed on a Raspberry Pi (small single-board computers), which serves as an edge device, able to optimize the overall efficiency with minimum power and minimum cost. The experimental results revealed that MinIO has the best overall performance regarding query response times, RAM consumption, disk IO time, and transaction rate. The results presented in this paper are intended for researchers in the field of edge computing and database systems.	performance evaluation;blockchain;bigchaindb;minio;ifps;object storage;file storage;databases;edge;secure storageblockchain
159	协同技术	Dynamic Rendering-Aware VR Service Module Placement Strategy in MEC Networks	Combining multiaccess edge computing (MEC) technology and wireless virtual reality (VR) game is a promising computing paradigm. Offloading the rendering tasks to the edge node can make up for the lack of computing resources of mobile devices. However, the current offloading works ignored that when rendering is enabled at the MEC server, the rendering operation depends heavily on the environment deployed on this MEC serve. In this paper, we propose a dynamically rendering-aware service module placement scheme for wireless VR games over the MEC networks. In this scheme, the rendering tasks of VR games are offloaded to the MEC server and closely coupled with service module placement. At the same time, to further optimize the end-to-end latency of VR video delivery, the routing delay of the rendered VR video stream and the costs of the service module migration are jointly considered with the proposed placement scheme. The goal of this scheme is to minimize the sum of the network costs over a long time under satisfying the delay constraint of each player. We model our strategy as a high-order, nonconvex, and time-varying function. To solve this problem, we transform the placement problem into the min-cut problem by constructing a series of auxiliary graphs. Then, we propose a two-stage iterative algorithm based on convex optimization and graphs theory to solve our object function. Finally, extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can ensure low end-to-end latency for players and low network costs over the other baseline algorithms.	online resource-allocation;wireless networks;migration;video;blockchain;radio;6g
160	元分析	Investigating the themes in supply chain finance: the emergence of blockchain as a disruptive technology	Blockchain has gained momentum as a disruptive technology in supply chain management against its introduction as a finance-related instrument. Nevertheless, the developing academic understanding and the limited practical implications lead to insufficient insights into the use of blockchain technology, particularly in the supply chain finance (SCF) domain. Thus, the expected potential of blockchain technology remains underexplored. Accordingly, this study explicates this situation by examining the extant literature findings and web-based big data that can provide evidence about the real needs in supply chains, and investigating how blockchain emerges as a disruptive SCF-oriented technology. The study employs a web analytics method, Search Engine Results Page (SERP) analysis which considers the trends in blockchain technology use and the interactions between blockchain, supply chain and finance appearing in Google searches. The SERP method examined real-time clicks, web traffics and most commonly asked questions about blockchain. The SERP findings revealed that the interest in blockchain technology neither focused on finance nor data privacy as emphasised in the literature but mainly on the benefits of increasing digitalisation and efficiency in supply chains. The results offered practical implications for capturing recent blockchain- and supply chain-related trends and designing more digital and efficient supply chains.	blockchain;search engine results page (serp);supply chain finance;web analytics;web trafficdestination marketing organizations;web analytics;innovation;capabilities;management;framework
161	实体经济	Security research of blockchain technology in electronic medical records	Background: A blockchain-based Electronic Health Record(EHR) data-sharing scheme was proposed to solve the problems of data sharing difficulties and privacy disclosure. Methods: This paper designs a blockchain-based electronic health record model based on the characteristics of blockchain antitampering, decentralization, and distributed storage. Utilize blockchain network and distributed database to store encryption-related access control policies to prevent EHR data from being tampered with and leaked. Data security sharing protocol combines Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and reencryption. Results: The protocol used the Delegated Proof of Stake(DPOS) algorithm to select the proxy node, which reencrypted the EHR to share data between a pair of users. Simulation experiments and comparative analysis showed that DPOS efficiency was higher than Proof of Work (POW) and slightly lower than the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance(PBFT). Conclusions: The scheme proposed in this paper is more decentralized and less computationally intensive.	blockchain;data sharing;distributed key generation;dpos;electronic medical records;pbft;pow
162	协同技术	A blockchain scheme for authentication, data sharing and nonrepudiation to secure internet of wireless sensor things	A blockchain based scheme is proposed in the underlying work for performing registration, mutual authentication, data sharing and nonrepudiation in internet of wireless sensor things. The nodes are divided into three types in the proposed scheme: sensor nodes, cluster heads and coordinators. Moreover, a consortium blockchain, deployed on the coordinators, is employed for storing the legitimate nodes' identities. Furthermore, coordinators also help in the execution of smart contracts, which facilitate the sensor nodes in authentication, data sharing and nonrepudiation processes. Additionally, for storing the nodes' ambient data, artificial intelligence based interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used. Furthermore, to increase the transaction throughput and efficiency of the network, a stellar consensus protocol is used. From the simulation results, the transaction latency of the proposed model is approximately 81.82% lower than the proof of work based model. Moreover, the gas consumption of data request and provisioning is 0.10 US Dollars.	mutual authentication;consortium blockchain;data sharing;data nonrepudiation;artificial intelligence;interplanetary file system;internet of wireless sensor thingsiot;architecture;system

164	协同技术	A Fuzzy-Based Method for Objects Selection in Blockchain-Enabled Edge-IoT Platforms Using a Hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Model	The broad availability of connected and intelligent devices has increased the demand for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require more intense data storage and processing. However, cloud-based IoT systems are typically located far from end-users and face several issues, including high cloud server load, slow response times, and a lack of global mobility. Some of these flaws can be addressed with edge computing. In addition, node selection helps avoid common difficulties related to IoT, including network lifespan, allocation of resources, and trust in the acquired data by selecting the correct nodes at a suitable period. On the other hand, the IoT's interconnection of edge and blockchain technologies gives a fresh perspective on access control framework design. This article provides a novel node selection approach for blockchain-enabled edge IoT that provides a quick and dependable node selection. Moreover, fuzzy logic to approximation logic was used to manage numerical and linguistic data simultaneously. In addition, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), a powerful tool for examining Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) problems, is used. The suggested fuzzy-based technique employs three input criteria to select the correct IoT node for a given mission in IoT-edge situations. The outcomes of the experiments indicate that the proposed framework enhances the parameters under consideration.	blockchain;security;iot;fuzzy method;node selection;mcdmdeployment optimization;node selection;relay

The proposed three phases are used to enhance the security mechanism in the employee performance assessment system: authentication, encryption, and data retrieval phase. The authentication process is performed in the first phase by utilizing Lamport Merkle digital signature (LMDS) algorithm. The LMDS algorithm generates and verifies a digital ID for each employee. In the next phase blockchain based encryption is carried on employee data using the new light weight cryptography algorithm (NLCA), which uses a 16 bytes (128 bit) block cipher and needs 16 bytes (128-bit) key to encrypt the data. At last, the data retrieval phase allows users to access the data through the secret key. Proposing a modified Diffie-Hellman (ReDH) algorithm to exchange the secret key to ensure security. The proposed approach is implemented in the Python platform, and the performance of the proposed approach is compared with existing methods in terms of encryption time, throughput, decryption time, storage efficiency, and search time. Using a blockchain-based employee performance assessment system enhances system trust level, transparency, accountability, and security efficiency.	authentication phase;blockchain;data retrieval phase;digital id;employee performance assessment system;encryption phasehealth

169	协同技术	Securing federated learning with blockchain: a systematic literature review	Federated learning (FL) is a promising framework for distributed machine learning that trains models without sharing local data while protecting privacy. FL exploits the concept of collaborative learning and builds privacy-preserving models. Nevertheless, the integral features of FL are fraught with problems, such as the disclosure of private information, the unreliability of uploading model parameters to the server, the communication cost, etc. Blockchain, as a decentralized technology, is able to improve the performance of FL without requiring a centralized server and also solves the above problems. In this paper, a systematic literature review on the integration of Blockchain in federated learning was considered with the analysis of the existing FL problems that can be compensated. Through carefully screening, most relevant studies are included and research questions cover the potential security and privacy attacks in traditional federated learning that can be solved by blockchain as well as the characteristics of Blockchain-based FL. In addition, the latest Blockchain-based approaches to federated learning have been studied in-depth in terms of security and privacy, records and rewards, and verification and accountability. Furthermore, open issues related to the combination of Blockchain and FL are discussed. Finally, future research directions for the robust development of Blockchain-based FL systems are proposed.	federated learning;blockchain;security;privacy;blockchain-based fl;systematic literature reviewtechnology;challenges;framework

Legacy credential verification systems are typically time-consuming, costly, and bureaucratic, and struggle against certain classes of credential fraud. In this article, we propose a comprehensive blockchain-based credential verification solution, Cerberus, which is considerably more efficient, easy, and intuitive to use, and effectively mitigates widespread manifestations of credential fraud. Cerberus also improves significantly upon other blockchain-based solutions in the research literature: it adheres closely to the existing credential verification ecosystem and addresses real-world fraud scenarios. Moreover, Cerberus uses on-chain smart contracts for credential revocation, and it does not entail students or employers to manage digital identities or cryptographic credentials to use the system. We prototype our solution and describe our attempt to design an online verification service with a rich feature set, including data privacy, transcript verification, and selective disclosure of data. We hope this effort contributes positively to alleviating the problem of fake credentials.	fraud;accreditation;education;ecosystems;blockchains;medical services;investment;accreditation;blockchain;credential fraudhigher-education

In today's era, the number of connected vehicles is growing intending to make life easier and more luxurious. However, with the advancements and demand for connected vehicles, there is a necessity to rethink the trustworthiness and safety of the data transmitted by the vehicles. The malicious vehicles may send incorrect information to peer vehicles just for the sake of their benefit. Data validation issues as well as issues like Authentication, Non-repudiation, Integrity, and Reliability related to VANET, are also addressed in this paper using Blockchain technology. B-VANET, a system that is the amalgamation of blockchain with VANET is proposed in this paper. Blockchain a peer-to-peer, decentralized, open distributed ledger technology is applied with VANET to make the network secure. Another major issue is the lack of interest in vehicles to forwarding messages is also addressed in this paper. To resolve this issue, a motivation-demotivation mechanism is embedded which will give incentives to all the involved vehicles in correct message communication and validation. The proposed B-VANET is implemented on the Hyperledger fabric platform and the performance of B-VANET is analyzed using the Hyperledger Caliper tool. B-VANET ensures that the network will not accept the fake messages and will not propagate them further which if propagated will affect the system adversely.	vanet;connected vehicles;blockchain;b-vanet;hyperledger fabric;hyperledger caliper

One of the supply chains most affected by COVID-19 is food supply chains. Since the sustainable food supply chain processes are complex and vulnerable in terms of product variety, it has been negatively affected by the operational effects of COVID-19. While the problems experienced in the supply chain processes and raw material constraints caused stops in production, the importance of new business models and production approaches came to the fore. One of the issues of increasing importance is the adoption of reverse logistics activities in sustainable food supply chains and increasing the resilience of food supply chains by integrating blockchain technology into processes. However, adapting blockchain technology to increase the resilience of reverse logistics activities in the food supply chain has advantages as well as risks that need to be considered. Therefore, it is aimed to determine these risks by using fuzzy synthetic evaluation method for eliminating the risks of blockchain adaptation for flexible reverse logistics in food supply chains to increase resiliency. The novelty of this study is that besides discussing about the benefits of BC-T, it is to identify the risks it can create, to eliminate these risks and to guide the establishment of resilience in reverse logistics activities of SFSCs. According to results, the risks with the highest value among the subrisks are determined as data security risks.

The combination of a demand for products of high quality and safety standards and the increasing number of stakeholders in supply chain networks has required the agri-food business to transform from vertically integrated to vertically operated supply chain networks. Nevertheless, this traditional agri-food supply chain form has exposure to some drawbacks. Meanwhile, blockchain technology as a disruptive technology today has the potential to provide value-added contributions towards multiple-disciplinary applications. Blockchain technology gains success and proves its functionality in improving the current supply chain by ensuring traceability, transparency and efficiency across the network from farmer to consumer. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the existing literature on vertical coordination in the supply chain and its mechanism and to develop a framework that explores how blockchain technology can address the challenges in coordination mechanisms. Furthermore, taking the current Vietnamese vertical coordination cashew supply chain as a case study, this research is based on the proposed framework to suggest a solution combining blockchain and other relative technologies for the Vietnamese cashew business.

The modern evolution of Healthcare 4.0 applying the Internet of Things (IoT) elements with cloud computing reforms to obtain remote medical services has grown the researcher's recognition with the perspective of the smart city. The Healthcare 4.0 standard has consists of different layers to perform medical operations like periodic data sensing, data storage, data sharing, and auditing. The delicate and private medical records of victims lead to numerous difficulties while defending them from hackers. Therefore saving, obtaining, and distributing the patient medical data on the remote storage requires safety attentions so that medical records should not be compromised by the authorized user's components of E-healthcare systems. To achieve secure medical data storage, sharing, and accessing in Cloud Service Provider (CSP), various cryptography algorithms have been designed so far. But these traditional resolutions disappointed to manage the trade-off among the provisions of EHR safety in terms of computational competence, user-side verification, service-side verification, security, and without the trusted third party. Blockchain-based security techniques achieved notable recognition due to the strength to give strong security provisions for medical records storage and sharing with the least computation forces. The blockchain made focused on bitcoin technology among the researchers. Employing the blockchain in healthcare systems has been of current interest. This paper aims to present a systematic study of different blockchain-based solutions for the smart healthcare 4.0 system. The recent blockchain-based security solutions have been reviewed first and, then we presented a research gap considering the various parameters. The outcome of this paper discusses the current research gaps, the challenges of implementing the blockchain-based secure healthcare system, and the future roadmap or solutions.	bitcoin;blockchain;cloud service provider;electronic heath records;healthcare 4;0;medical data;data storage;data sharing;securitybig data;scheme
179	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Access Control in a Globalized Healthcare Provisioning Ecosystem	The COVID-19 pandemic further outlined the importance of global healthcare services provisioning for diagnosing and treating patients who tend to travel and live for large periods away from home and can be anywhere at any given time. Advances in technology enable healthcare practitioners to access critical data regarding a person's health status to provide better services. Medical data are sensitive in nature, and therefore, a reliable mechanism should ensure that only authorized entities can access data when needed. This paper, through a layered consideration of a Globalized Healthcare Provisioning Ecosystem (GHPE), reveals the interdependencies among its major components and suggests a necessary abstraction to identify requirements for the design of an access control suitable for the ecosystem. These requirements are imposed by the nature of the medical data as well as by the newly introduced potentials of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. As a result, an attribute-based access control framework is proposed aiming to provide prompt and secure access to medical data globally by utilizing state-of-the-art technologies and standards, including Next-Generation Access Control (NGAC), blockchain and smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are proposed that enable access control to implement attribute and policy stores where policy classes and attributes are decentralized and immutable. In addition, the usage of blockchain-based distributed identities allows patients to be in control of access to their medical data and also enables healthcare service providers to access medical data promptly and reliably through the proposed access control framework. The qualitative characteristics of the proposed approach toward a decentralized and patient-centric access control in GHPE are demonstrated and discussed based on an application paradigm.	access control;ngac;blockchain;ethereum;smart contracts;healthcare;iomtauthentication;internet;systems

Making secure communication between IoT devices is one approach to accomplish this. To address this issue, we present an effective technique for intranetwork and internetwork device-to-device secure communication that enables IoT device identification and authentication while also providing secure communication in an open environment. The method also provides data integrity in addition to authentication and secure communication. We have presented informal security analysis, which confirms that there is no important security threats in our protocol.

Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain (BC) are emerging as potentially disruptive technologies. Whereby, the IoT is a system of inter-related devices with unique identifiers for data sharing and device management and control. IoT is based on the inte-gration of traditional technologies including embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, and automation. While, the concept of IoT is continuously evolving with the convergence of multiple technologies including real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensor, and embedded systems. On the other hand, BC technology is a distributed ledger used to maintain the transaction logs of a network, and it has started revolutionizing data provenance, storage, secure, and traceable transaction management systems.

This article reviews the current state-of-art blockchain technology and its current utilization in different application domains of IoT. Furthermore, it presents the use of blockchain technology with digital ledger technology (DLT) and IoT. Similarly, the notable challenges of BC and IoT integration are presented. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such SLR available that provides a comprehensive review in this domain. Applying blockchain to solve IoT problems improves IoT security.

182	市场治理	Cryptocurrency Connectedness: Does Controlling for the Cross-Correlations Matter?	A growing literature has employed the existing generalized spillover measures to measure the connectedness - or market integration - of cryptocurrencies. This method, while useful, does not properly control for the cross-correlations of the cryptocurrencies when computing aggregate spillovers from all others to any given cryptocurrency, whereas the joint spillover method of Lastrapes and Wiesen (2021) does. This paper further describes the novel multivariate conditioning sets employed by the joint spillover method. By employing these two techniques and evaluating the differences in the results, we demonstrate that controlling for the cross-correlations of cryptocurrencies matters for measuring aggregate spillovers and the overall connectedness of the cryptocurrency market. Using data on ten of the most traded cryptocurrencies, we find that the generalized spillover index overestimates overall connectedness by over nine percentage points relative to the new joint spillover index. This difference varies temporally and across cryptocurrencies.	bitcoin;connectedness;cryptocurrency;market integration;variance decomposition;volatility spilloversimpulse-response analysis;volatility spillovers;market;integration;return

Usually, the transmission of quantum states between banks and user needs to be involved. It is difficult to ensure the safe transmission of quantum states, which will lead to the loss and reconstruction of quantum money. In this paper, we make and store quantum states by the bank, and then the bank adds its own signature, which is public and verifiable by anyone. After the user adds his signature, the quantum currency is considered to be effective. We propose a trading application based on quantum money.

This study analyses the impact of different uncertainties on commodity markets to assess commodity markets' hedging or safe-haven properties. Using time-varying dynamic conditional correlation and wavelet-based Quantile-on-Quantile regression models, our findings show that, both before and during the COVID-19 crisis, soybeans and clean energy stocks offer strong safe-haven opportunities against cryptocurrency price uncertainty and geopolitical risks (GPR). Soybean markets weakly hedge cryptocurrency policy uncertainty, US economic policy uncertainty, and crude oil volatility. In addition, GSCI commodity and crude oil also offer a weak safe-haven property against cryptocurrency uncertainties and GPR.

The focus of this paper is to examine the role of bullish, neutral, and bearish investors' sentiments on the connection between the five (5) most traded crypto-currencies and the precious metals market. The following findings are perceptible from our analyses. First, in the spillover tests, there exists a significant high level of connection between the two markets. Second, the spillover results also reveal that tetherum and silver are net receivers of the shocks, while most of the cryptocurrencies are net transmitters of the volatility. Third, the BDS test shows strong evidence of non -linearity is a very crucial factor to be put into consideration when examining the role of investors' senti-ments on the interactions between the cryptocurrency and precious metals markets. Fourth, the non -parametric causality-in-quantile test confirms that the connectedness between the cryptocurrency and precious metal markets is speculation driven. These results have important policy implications for pol-icymakers and market participants.(c) 2022 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Published by Elsevier Inc.

186	市场治理	Safe-haven properties of soft commodities during times of Covid-19	We use wavelet coherence analysis on global COVID-19 fear index and, soft commodities' spot and futures prices to investigate safe-haven properties of soft commodities over the period from January 28, 2020 to April 29, 2021. Our findings show that each of the sampled soft commodities shows safe-haven behavior in one of the spot or futures markets and for one of the short-term or long-term investors during the times of COVID-19. Our results also show that safe-haven properties of soft commodities are contingent upon the nature of the commodity. The findings of our mean-variance portfolio analysis indicate that the portfolios with commodity futures are less risky and efficient compared to the portfolio containing stocks only, thus robustly supporting the safe-haven properties of soft commodities during COVID-19. Our results not only have important implications for individual investors and asset managers in suggesting particular soft commodities to strengthen safe-haven and diversification features of their portfolios but also can assist the policy makers to understand and disentangle health fear dimension of several interlocking dynamics affecting the spot and futures prices of soft commodities during COVID-19.	wavelet coherence;soft commodities;global covid-19 fear indexdiversification benefits;stock-market;gold;prices;hedge;oil;dependence;returns;bitcoin;crisis
187	核心技术	A Reputation-Based Mechanism for Transaction Processing in Blockchain Systems	Blockchain protocols require nodes to verify all received transactions before forwarding them. However, massive spam transactions cause the participants in blockchain systems to consume many resources in verifying and propagating transactions. This paper proposes a reputation-based mechanism to increase the efficiency of processing transactions by considering the reputations of the sending nodes. Reputations are in turn adjusted based on the quality of transaction processing. Our proposed reputation-based mechanism offers three main contributions. First, we modify the verification strategy so that nodes set a probability of verifying a received transaction considering the likelihood of it being spam: transactions from a node with a low reputation have a high probability of being verified. Second, we optimize the transaction forwarding protocol to reduce propagation delay by prioritizing forwarding transactions to reputable receivers. Third, we design a data request protocol that provides alternative data exchange methods for nodes with different reputations. A series of simulations demonstrate the performance of our reputation-based mechanism.	blockchains;costs;peer-to-peer computing;generators;bitcoin;denial-of-service attack;delays;blockchain;reputation-based mechanism;strategic verification;forwarding protocol;data requestalgorithm;model

189	核心技术	A Comparative Study of Consensus Mechanisms in Blockchain for IoT Networks	The consensus mechanism is a core component of Blockchain technology, allowing thousands of nodes to agree on a single and consistent view of the Blockchain. A carefully selected consensus mechanism can provide attributes such as fault tolerance and immutability to an application. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a use case that can take advantage of these unique Blockchain properties. IoT devices are commonly implemented in sensitive domains such as health, smart cities, and supply chains. Resilience and data integrity are important for these domains, as failures and malicious data tampering could be detrimental to the systems that rely on these IoT devices. Additionally, Blockchains are well suited for decentralised networks and networks with high churn rates. A difficulty involved with applying Blockchain technology to the IoT is the lack of computational resources. This means that traditional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) are unsuitable. In this paper, we will compare several popular consensus mechanisms using a set of criteria, with the aim of understanding which consensus mechanisms are suitable for deployment in the IoT, and what trade-offs are required. We show that there are opportunities for both PoW and PoS to be implemented in the IoT, with purpose-made IoT consensus mechanisms like PoSCS and Microchain. Our analysis shows that Microchain and PoSCS have characteristics that are well suited for IoT consensus.	consensus;iot;blockchainsupply chain;cryptocurrency;time
190	核心技术	Holistic Research on Blockchain's Consensus Protocol Mechanisms with Security and Concurrency Analysis Aspects of CPS	In the present era, the consensus for blockchain is of three types: consortium/permissioned, decentralized/permissionless, and somewhat decentralized. Presently, security and privacy of blockchain scenarios are in four directions: auditability and transparency, accountability and non-repudiation, contract privacy, and transactional privacies. Blockchain works on multilayered architectures with its consensus mechanisms. In this paper, important mechanisms of various consensus protocols for application specific usage are analyzed. In general, these consensus mechanisms have four groups of properties; all are examined and discussed. Moreover, the security analysis is shown. Furthermore, the paper examines the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), which is in use by the cryptocurrencies along with many blockchain-based systems. Moreover, a variant of ECDSA (vECDSA) is also considered. In particular, ECDSA and vECDSA are compared in this research. In addition, modeling and analysis aspects related to the security and concurrency aspects of CPS are discussed. In particular, Petri-net-based models of CPS are considered, especially in terms of liveness and boundedness properties of the system.	cyber-physical systems (cps);consensus protocols;security;petri nets;proof of work (pow);elliptic curve cryptography (ecc);ecdsa;elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ecdlp);vecdsa;proof of stake (pos)dynamic partial reconfiguration;petri nets;control-systems;internet;design
191	核心技术	Stochastic performance modeling for practical byzantine fault tolerance consensus in the blockchain	The practical Byzantine fault tolerant (PBFT) consensus mechanism is one of the most basic consensus algorithms (or protocols) in blockchain technologies. Thus its performance evaluation is an interesting and challenging topic due to the higher complexity of its consensus work in a peer-to-peer network. This study describes a simple stochastic performance model of the PBFT consensus mechanism. This model is refined not only as a queuing system with complicated service times but also as a level-independent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. With regard to the level-independent QBD process, we apply the matrix-geometric solution to obtain the necessary and sufficient condition under which the PBFT consensus system is stable and then numerically compute the stationary probability vector of the QBD process. Thus, we provide four useful performance measures for the PBFT consensus mechanism, and we can numerically calculate these performance measures. Finally, we use numerical examples to verify the validity of our theoretical results and demonstrate how the four performance measures are influenced by certain key parameters of the PBFT consensus. Considering theory of multi-dimensional Markov processes, we are optimistic that the methodology and results presented in this study are applicable to a wide range of PBFT consensus mechanism and even other types of consensus mechanisms.	blockchain;practical byzantine fault tolerant (pbft);consensus mechanism;quasi-birth-and-death (qbd) process;matrix-geometric solution;performance evaluationnetwork
192	实体经济	A data-driven, comparative review of the academic literature and news media on blockchain-enabled supply chain management: Trends, gaps, and research needs	The application of blockchain technology in supply chain management has become a popular area of discussion in research and practice. This paper develops a computational, data-driven synthesis of the scholarly literature versus news media on BT-enabled supply chain management (BT-SCM) to uncover major trends, understand how academic research is aligned with business practice, and find out existing gaps. Through text mining and topic modeling of 1148 full-text research papers and 5130 news articles, major themes within each domain, their patterns of evolution over time, and the depth and breadth of their associations were identified. Mapping ana-lyses were also conducted based on the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model and the main SCM research streams to further explore existing knowledge gaps. The findings revealed that BT-enabled supply chain asset management, BT-enabled reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain, and actual versus anticipated performance outcomes of BT-SCM are among important pathways for future research. The findings also high-lighted where there is more need to enhance the practical relevance of BT-SCM research considering advances in business adoption. The paper provides a comprehensive, unbiased assessment of the BT-SCM knowledge land-scape and a taxonomy of the research questions related to the technical and managerial aspects of BT-SCM that are particularly useful for the community of researchers in the field. It offers a practical framework that can be applied to assess the academic literature on other emerging technologies in SCM where state-of-the-practice is key to guiding research efforts.	blockchain technology (bt);bt-enabled supply chain management (bt-scm);data-driven modeling;latent dirichlet allocation (lda);literature review;news mediaindustry 4.0;intelligence;innovation;systems;green
193	实体经济	Accelerated optimal maintenance scheduling for generation units on a truthful platform	Maintenance of generation units is a measure to ensure the reliability of power systems. In this paper, a novel blockchain-based truthful condition-based maintenance of generation units (T-CBMGU) platform is proposed to innovate and upgrade state-of-the-art CBMGU. In addition, two valid inequalities are proposed to accelerate the convergence speed of Benders decomposition in maintenance scheduling process. The proposed valid inequalities are formulated based on technical/physical analysis and greedy-based heuristic initialization. More specifically, for data acquisition and failure rate diagnosis/prognosis processes, T-CBMGU can ensure the immutability of the collected operational data. In this way, the influence of tampered data on the diagnosis/prognosis results in state-of-the-art CBMGU can be reduced. For maintenance scheduling and bidding to change scheduled time slot processes, in state-of-the-art CBMGU, the decision makers, i.e., independent system operators (ISOs), may not be trusted. However, in T-CBMGU, the scheduling and bidding processes are implemented automatically via smart contracts rather than by the ISOs; as such, incentives to manipulate data can be avoided. Finally, regarding performance of maintenance actions, in contrast to state-of-theart CBMGU, the implementation process can be truthfully recorded by the T-CBMGU platform, which facilitates backtracking of responsibility. Then, the T-CBMGU platform and the valid inequalities are tested for the IEEE 300-bus power system. Furthermore, cases with tampered data and distrust caused by fairness manipulation are simulated to show the importance of using T-CBMGU. Finally, the Benders decomposition algorithm with valid inequalities is compared with other solvers to demonstrate its fast convergence speed. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

We outline the process of integrating QuickChick a framework for property-based testing built on top of the Coq proof assistant into a real-world language implementation in OCaml. We discuss the challenges we have encountered when generating well-typed programs for a realistic higher-order smart contract language, which mixes purely functional and imperative computations and features runtime resource accounting. We describe the set of the language implementation properties that we tested, as well as the semantic harness required to enable their validation. The properties range from the standard type safety to the soundness of a control- and type-flow analysis used by the optimizing compiler. Finally, we present the list of bugs discovered and rediscovered with the help of QuickChick and discuss their severity and possible ramifications.	random testing;property-based testing;definitional interpreters;higher-order control-flow analysis;smart contracts;quickchick;scilla
195	核心技术	Blockchain-Based Light-Weighted Provable Data Possession for Low Performance Devices	Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes have long been proposed to solve problem of how to check the integrity of data stored in cloud service without downloading. However, with the emerging of network consisting of low performance devices such as Internet of Things, we find that there are still two obstacles for applying PDP schemes. The first one is the heavy computation overhead in generating tags for data blocks, which is essential for setting up any PDP scheme. The other one is how to resist collusion attacks from third party auditors with any possible entities participating the auditing. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based light-weighted PDP scheme for low performance devices, with an instance deployed on a cloud server. We design a secure outsourced tag generating method for low performance devices, which enables a kind of "hash-sign-switch" two-phase tag computing. With this method, users with low performance devices can employ third party auditors to compute modular exponential operations that accounts for the largest portion of computation overhead in tag generation, without leaking their data content. Chaincodes in blockchain network ensure the correctness of such outsourcing and prevent collusion attacks. The security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our scheme is both secure and efficient.	provable data possession;outsourced computation;blockchain;smart contract;chameleon hashdata-storage
196	技术治理	Leveraging Contractive Autoencoder with Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning and Resilient KNN for Detection of multi-level Bitcoin Ransomware	In recent years, ransomware attacks have become increasingly rampant by the offenders for which ransomware has maintained a major cyber security threat as time progresses. With paradigm shift from social to technical factors, ransomware has also maintained the equal adaptiveness by shifting its focus from initial days' scareware and locker attacks to most recent crypto-ransomware threats. There is no silver bullet available to wipe out completely crypto-ransomware attacks for its obvious relationships between social engineering which investigates more infections with encrypted malware. Bitcoin, a means of digital payment demanded by Ransomware family needs characterization and analysis to predict the crypto-ransomware attack types. In this paper, at first, contractive autoencoder (CAE) is used on bitcoin transaction dataset for dimensionality reduction as a filter approach in order to obtain a reduced yet a powerful representation of the raw data and then the output of CAE is applied to the classifier for its improved performance and to make it a robust model. We use two classifiers for our experiments namely: Resilient KNN and Fuzzy Lattice Reasoning (FLR). The original KNN classifier was successful in dealing with homogenous data where the values of the numerical attribute exist completely but poses limitations while dealing with heterogeneous incomplete data containing mixed data (numeric and categorical) yet having missing values. Further, KNN used same K values for all the query objects that sometimes leads to misclassification. Resilient KNN is proposed in this paper to deal with these pitfalls effectively by assigning different k-values for different query objects, so as to obtain a most accurate predictive model. Next, the FLR is used for its ability to handle different types of data types and moreover, it is incremental and fast learning which tempted us to explore its possibility in detecting the crypto-ransomware attacks efficiently. The experimental results with several conventional and new evaluation metrics justifies the suitability of our proposed approach in building a robust and efficient classifier model to detect crypto ransomware families in comparison to existing research.	bitcoin;crypto-ransomware;cyber security;autoencoder;flr;resilient knn;likelihood ratio;youden's index;net benefit;efficiency index;gain;detection accuracysystem
197	实体经济	Blockchain-based solution for COVID-19 vaccine waste reduction	Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have been produced on a large scale since 2020. However, large-scale vaccine production has led to two forms of waste; namely, overproduction and underutilization. Most of today's systems and technologies used to manage waste data related to COVID-19 vaccines fall short of providing transparency, traceability, accountability, trust, and security features. In this paper, we address the problem of COVID-19 vaccines waste due to their overproduction and underutilization. We propose a blockchain-based solution that is composed of five phases: registration, commitment; production and delivery; consumption; and waste assessment. These phases make up the complete life cycle of a COVID-19 vaccine, and they are governed by several smart contracts to ensure accountability of all the actions taken by the involved entities and reduce any excessive waste caused by overproduction, overordering, or underconsumption. We ensure security, traceability, and data provenance by recording all actions through smart contracts in the form of events on an immutable ledger. We utilize decentralized storage such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to reduce the costs posed by large-sized file storage when stored on-chain. We present algorithms that describe the logic behind our developed smart contracts. We test and validate the functionalities of our proposed solution. We conduct security, cost, and scalability analyses to show that our solution is affordable, scalable, and secure. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain-based solutions to show its novelty and superiority. The smart contract code is made publicly available on GitHub.	vaccine waste accountability;blockchain;ethereum;smart contracts;vaccine production;covid-19 vaccinesupply chain;management
198	实体经济	MB-BC: Drug Traceability System Based on Multibranched Blockchain Structure	The establishment of a complete drug traceability system is essentially important for public drug security and the business of pharmaceutical companies which is aimed at tracking where the drug has gone along the drug supply chain. Traditional centralized server-client technical solutions have been far from satisfaction for their bad performances in data authenticity, privacy, system resilience, and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a drug traceability scheme called MB-BC, which realizes the security and traceability of drug data through a novel multibranched blockchain scheme. Different from the characteristics of transparency of traditional blockchains, MB-BC realizes fine-grained access control of data between all levels in the system, which improves the security and privacy of data. MB-BC has further improved the existing consensus mechanism, strengthened the supervision of pharmaceutical companies, and further improved the safety and robustness of the system. Furthermore, the system combines data access strategies with smart contracts; each branch chain can also issue its smart contract to provide personalized services. Finally, security and performance evaluations show that the solution is advantageous in terms of data security, system robustness, supervisibility, and traceability, as well as efficient in terms of blockchain throughput, data query time, and blockchain consensus consumptions, compared with other typical approaches.	
199	协同技术	On the Integration of Blockchain With IoT and the Role of Oracle in the Combined System: The Full Picture	The remarkable increase in the number of interconnected smart devices in today's Internet of things networks introduces more challenges related to security, trust, and centralization, which require more effective solutions. Fortunately, blockchain technology has recently emerged as a potential rescuer for IoT-based solutions due to its decentralization and enhanced security features. It is usual for smart contracts to arise in handling and processing the generated data when IoT devices are combined with blockchain. However, blockchain and smart contracts need to interact with input data of the same level of trust to guarantee correct applications execution. This implies using oracles to provide trust compatibility between inserted information collected from IoT devices and blockchain and smart contracts. Therefore, this study adopts a methodology that was shaped based on current literature and design and experiments to provide a full narrative of the process of combining two of the most intriguing systems in today's world of technology, namely, blockchain and IoT including a very important part of the comprehensive system, viz. blockchain oracle. Moreover, it was found that the literature lacks a complete view of the IoT-blockchain integration process that covers all its important and related aspects. Therefore, this work is an attempt to fill the gap in literature and contribute to the body of knowledge by surveying the literature about existing IoT-blockchain architectures and shed light on the role of blockchain in addressing IoT issues while demonstrating the concept of oracles as well as their functions in addition to the main operating blockchain oracles. Additionally, this work illustrates a CO2 measuring use case where a smart contract is developed and tested as part of two proposed oracle-based designs. The obtained results demonstrate a full picture of a practical integrated IoT-blockchain system architecture.	blockchains;internet of things;smart contracts;security;peer-to-peer computing;carbon;trust management;data quality;information integrity;data integrity;blockchain;challenges;data authentication;enhanced performance;internet of things;integration;oracle;smart contract;trustinternet;technology;framework;security;edge;performance;things;cloud

Second, considering the difference in price fluctuations between gold and Bitcoin, based on the GARCH-EVT model to increase the risk uncertainty of financial assets, proposes how to achieve the best trading strategy under risk characteristics. Finally, considering the influence of transaction rate on income, we use particle swarm algorithm and genetic algorithm to study what kind of transaction rate can achieve maximum income. The study found that although traders can predict future trends based on daily price changes, due to the different risk factors of gold and Bitcoin, and the different sensitivity of the two financial assets to transaction costs, trading strategies will be very different.	price prediction;trading strategy;neural networkportfolio selection;price;rates;gold

We analyse these differential features of the cryptocurrency market by studying their return persistence, return asymmetry, interdependency, and volatility spillover. The vector autoregressive moving average model with variance gamma innovations is proposed to capture these features before and during the pandemic outbreak.

204	实体经济	A blockchain based lightweight peer-to-peer energy trading framework for secured high throughput micro-transactions	With the electric power grid experiencing a rapid shift to the smart grid paradigm over a deregulated energy market, Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions are gaining prominence and innovative Peer To Peer (P2P) energy trading at micro-level are being deployed. Such advancement, however leave traditional security models vulnerable and pave the path for Blockchain, an Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with its decentralized, open and transparency characteristics as a viable alternative. However, due to deregulation in energy trading markets, massive volumes of micro transactions are required to be supported, which become a performance bottleneck with existing Blockchain solution such as Hyperledger, Ethereum and so on. In this paper, a lightweight 'Tangle' based framework, namely IOTA (Third generation DLT) is employed for designing an energy trading market that uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based solution that not only alleviates the reward overhead for micro-transactions but also provides scalability, quantum-proof, and high throughput of such transactions at low confirmation latency. Furthermore the Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) protocol is used over the IOTA P2P energy trading framework that allows energy producer and consumer to share the data while maintaining the confidentiality, and facilitates the data accessibility. The Raspberry Pi 3 board along with voltage sensor (INA219) used for the setting up light node and publishing and fetching data from the Tangle. The results of the obtained benchmarking indicate low confirmation latency, high throughput, system with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Moreover, the effect of transaction rate decreases when the IOTA bundle size increases more than 10. For bundle size 5 and 10 it behaves absolutely better than any other platform. The speedy confirmation time of transactions in IOTA, is most suitable for peer to peer energy trading scenarios. This study serves as a guideline for deploying, end-to-end transaction with IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and improving the performance of Blockchain in the energy sector under various operating conditions.	research challenges;internet;system;things

206	核心技术	Technology and Security Analysis of Cryptocurrency Based on Blockchain	Blockchain technology applied to cryptocurrencies is the dominant factor in maintaining the security of cryptocurrencies. This article reviews the technological implementation of cryptocurrency and the security and stability of cryptocurrency and analyzes the security support from blockchain technology and its platforms based on empirical case studies. Our results show that the security support from blockchain technology platforms is significantly insufficient and immature. In addition, we further Zyskind and Nathan (2015) and Choi (2019) and find that the top ten platforms play critical roles in security support and have significant advantages in terms of funds, duration, and human resources. Moreover, these platforms provide computational resources and benefits to the consensus algorithm selection for blockchain practitioners. Second, encryption ensures the security of cryptocurrencies. On the one hand, the digital signatures identify the identity of the signatory and the transaction. However, the principle of the hash algorithm (SHA256) confirms ownership. Meanwhile, SHA256 is infeasible to compute in the reverse direction and is difficult to attack. Furthermore, the records in the blockchain can be queried by every participant, making the system information transparent and open reliable. Third, compared to the study of Fu and Fang 2016, we find that the blockchain structure is composed of security components and basic components of six layers that are independent and cannot be extended completely and have a certain coupling among them. Fourth, the underlying ledger structures of Bitcoin and DAG are highly correlated to their security. Specifically, we follow Sompolinsky et al. (2016) and detect that the structure of SPECTRE ensures network security and robustness from its block production, conflict resolution, and generated trusted transaction sets. Meanwhile, the voting algorithm of SPECTRE makes resolving conflicting transactions by calculating votes and ensuring the transaction information that is virtually unable to be tampered with possible. In particular, the security calculation power of SPECTRE can reach 51% and resist "double-spend attacks" and "censorship attacks" effectively. In addition, the RDL framework of SPECTRE achieves security confirmation of transferring funds. Moreover, PHANTOM identifies evil blocks by employing block connectivity analysis and ensures its security. Eventually, we also expand the studies of (Sompolinsky et al., 2016 and Sompolinsky et al., 2017) and compare the basic characteristics of the protocols of Bitcoin, SPECTRE, and PHANTOM and find that protocols play imperative roles throughout the implementation process of cryptocurrency. In addition, the underlying ledger structure and consensus mechanism make up a blockchain while the confirmation time, throughput limit, and ordering are prerequisites for smart contracts.	governance;trust
207	核心技术	CR-BA: Public Key Infrastructure Certificate Revocation Scheme Based on Blockchain and Accumulator	With the development of blockchain, many studies apply blockchain to certificate revocation. However, existing blockchain-based certificate revocation schemes have two shortcomings. First, the storage overhead on the blockchain is relatively large. Second, as the number of revoked certificates increases, the misjudgment rate of certificate status will increase accordingly, so a public key infrastructure implementation certificate revocation scheme based on blockchain and accumulators, called CR-BA, is proposed. First, CR-BA expands the certificate structure, adding a revocation factor and a smart contract account for accessing the blockchain in the certificate extension, which is filled by the CA when the certificate is generated. Then, when the certificate is to be revoked, CA generates the revocation fingerprint through the revocation factor and publishes it to the blockchain. Finally, when the user needs to verify the status of the certificate, CA calculates the revocation fingerprint according to the revocation factor on the certificate, then compares it with the existing revocation fingerprint on the blockchain, and returns the comparison result to the user. The experimental results show that this scheme can effectively overcome the storage and misjudgment problems caused by existing blockchain-based certificate revocation schemes and improve the query efficiency of certificate revocation information.	
208	核心技术	Delay Analysis of Consensus Communication for Blockchain-Based Applications Using Network Calculus	Blockchain has been witnessed a growing application in mobile communication. The application field ranges from the Internet of Things (IoT), Vehicle to Everything (V2X), Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), etc. The conjunction with blockchain can significantly avoid data tempering and protect user privacy. Although blockchain guarantees the security of mobile communication, the operation cost is increasing. The consensus algorithm of blockchain drives multiple untrust parties to keep data consistency, and it generates a large number of communication overheads. In this letter, we focus on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) type of consensus and conduct a performance model. By utilizing the deterministic network calculus method, we analyze the delay bound of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and HotStuff consensus algorithm. The result of the simulation provides a valuable guideline for delay-sensitive blockchain-based applications.	delays;blockchains;calculus;task analysis;complexity theory;peer-to-peer computing;mobile communication;blockchain;pbft;hotstuff;delay analysis;network calculus
209	实体经济	Using FIWARE and blockchain in smart cities solutions	Nowadays, Blockchain has been widely used to store decentralized and secure transactions involving cryptocurrency, e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. However, Blockchain can also store other types of information besides monetary transactions. On the other hand, innovative solutions for smart cities are concerned with how services and information can be safely stored and shared. For this reason, smart city systems can benefit from using Blockchain to integrate their data and services. These smart solutions also demand consistency and standardization across the industry. However, this Blockchain integration varies according to its implementation. FIWARE, a framework of an open-source platform for smart solutions, adopts NGSI Standards (Context Information Management (CIM); NGSI-LD API: Tech. Rep., CIM and ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG), 2020) to enable the integration of components and provides the basis for interoperability and portability among smart solutions. Unfortunately, FIWARE does not support any integration with Blockchain technology. Hence, this paper proposes a set of new components to allow FIWARE to be integrated with Blockchain technology. With these proposed components, it is possible to support Blockchain technology with smart city applications via the FIWARE platform. For instance, we have designed and implemented a FIWARE Blockchain adapter to submit/listen to transactions from/to FIWARE Context Broker to/from any Blockchain implementation without human intervention.

This article proposes the advantages and disadvantages of blockchain and the current factors that trigger network security defense. A multimicrogrid customer transaction system under the blockchain technology is also proposed. We will illustrate the compatibility between multimicrogrid and blockchain, which is self-adaptive and can be adjusted in time with market changes. Third, in order to ensure the normal operation of the distribution network, a smart contract dynamic constraint scheme is designed for power flow constraints and voltage offset problems. Multimicrogrid system as energy interconnection research on multiagent competitive game on multimicrogrid system is crucial to the development of energy Internet technology. Blockchain-based decision-making systems exist based on a comprehensive analysis of the needs and interests of microgrid operators, large users, and distributed aggregators. For the complex problem of multimicrogrid system competition game model, a suitable solution method (IACO) is proposed. The model and solution algorithm established by the experiment are accurately analyzed, and the simulation result is that the optimal electricity price strategy in the subdivision field can effectively balance the interests of different market players and achieve win-win and coordinated development. Experiments show that IACO can deal with the multiple problems of blockchain.	
211	实体经济	A Blockchain Architecture for Trusted Sub-Ledger Operations and Financial Audit Using Decentralized Microservices	Blockchain has become an unavoidable future in enterprise finance, particularly enabling and securing cross-company transactions. By introducing a comparable notion of smart contract, the trusted sub-ledger operation (TSLO), this article will propose a complete architecture based on the Blockchain to solve the traceability and validity of accounting data by assets groupement. TSLO is a more flexible and adaptable method for asset management in the corporate accounting system and the enterprise resource planner. This method is built on a decentralized microservices tree (DMST) and is an extendable E-Bidding form of TEA (Triple Entry Accounting). Instead of using a multi-ledger architecture, the Hyperledger Fabric skeleton, limited to participant channels inside one entity or organization, our approach uses decentralized sub-ledgers with an implementation tree (DMST) for an assets-driven transactions. Furthermore, the government's audit and taxation procedures for financial groups are more accessible by combining Proof of Authority and Proof of Stake to assure the logic of More stake more reputation to preserve.	blockchains;smart contracts;cryptography;computer architecture;companies;peer-to-peer computing;distributed ledger;blockchain;sub-ledger;accounting;hyper-ledger;decentralized;assets;authority;stakesmart contracts
212	虚拟经济	Jumping from mother monkey to bored ape: the value of NFTs from an artist's and intellectual property perspective	2021 was a miraculous year for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which led to confusion among observers of the phenomenon from both the art industry and regulatory authorities. This article provides a dispassionate analysis of the value of NFTs from an artist's and intellectual property (IP) perspective. In the longer term, NFTs could improve the fate of artists to authenticate their works, set their conditions and get a resale compensation per transaction. This could happen, once their underlying works can be minted too, so that an NFT entails more than just a self-referential certificate. The article focuses on the US jurisdiction where the NFT phenomenon originated and only touches upon the EU jurisdiction in regard to the droit de suite right and Chinese jurisdiction in regard to the transmutation of NFTs into the speculation-proof 'digital collectibles'. The introduction provides a primer on the blockchain, NFTs, and the paradox of digital uniqueness and authenticity. Section II addresses the value game of art before and after the emergence of NFTs. Section III investigates the commercial side of NFT art and its new version of Maecenas. Section IV provides an analysis of the rights of the NFT holder versus the rights of the artist from an IP perspective; and focuses on unauthorized use of underlying works and regulation in the US and China. Section V provides the conclusions and contemplates whether NFTs will redefine the future of art and artists: from a showcase of bragging rights to an essential tool for artists to protect their IP rights.	value of art;copyright;maecenas;nft;resale right
213	虚拟经济	Blockchain and NFTs for Time-Bound Access and Monetization of Private Data	Digital data has enabled organizations to anticipate future threats, opportunities, and trends. However, digital data owners do not know how their data is accessed, shared, and monitized. In this paper, we propose using blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to enable time-bound access and monitization of private data. Our approach allows users to upload encrypted content and mint it into NFTs. Other users can access the NFTs' content by requesting a purchase or a license. Purchasing content transfers the ownership of the NFTs to the buyer; whereas, licensing them permits accessing the private data for a limited period of time, after which the data gets automatically deleted. Our developed approach uses the decentralized application (DApp), proxy reencryption (PRE), InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and trusted execution environment (TEE) for managing a fully decentralized and robust system. We implement a proof-of-concept system in an Ethereum-based environment, which is used for testing and vulnerability checks. We present the cost and security analyses and discuss the generalization aspect of the solution. Our smart contracts and testing scripts are publicly available under an open-source license.	blockchains;smart contracts;peer-to-peer computing;nonfungible tokens;licenses;decentralized applications;information storage;trust management;market research;file systems;blockchain;non-fungible tokens;ethereum;data sharing;data monetization;decentralized application;trusted execution environment;decentralized storage;proxy reencryptionchallenges
214	核心技术	Form Specification of Smart Contract for Intellectual Property Transaction Based on Blockchain	In view of the current chaotic structure of smart contracts and no unified definition of smart contracts, the implementation of smart contracts for the same business in the same field is quite different due to different development institutions and operating platforms, resulting in a low level of smart contract sharing and high development costs, hindering the development of smart contracts. Combined with the intellectual property transaction scenario, this paper proposes a blockchain-based intellectual property transaction smart contract form specification, designs the overall structure and process specification of the smart contract in the intellectual property transaction process, formulates a standard for the standardization of smart contract writing in intellectual property transaction scenarios, and solves the current chaotic structure of intellectual property transaction smart contracts, which is conducive to the collaborative development of scholars in various fields.	
215	核心技术	Design and Application of Legally Valid Payment Templates Based on Linking Contracts	Smart contracts are widely employed in many industries as a result of the high-quality development of science and economic technology, as well as the introduction of blockchain, which can automatically conduct retrieval, verification, and payment tasks. Smart contracts as an emerging topic, particularly the study of smart legal contracts, must remain forward-looking, and the smart contract sector cannot wait for the legal status of smart contracts to be resolved before advancing. The relative lag of the law becomes unavoidable due to the unassembled and unpredictable character of the law and thus its legislation. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of smart contracts into the scope of legal regulation, the construction of a series of systems for smart contracts, and the prognosis of smart contracts in terms of contract logic, arbitration process, and formal verification from the current law. Furthermore, a smart contract payment template based on semantic-aware graph neural networks is proposed to address the traditional smart contract vulnerability detection payment template method's low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate, as well as the neural network-based method's insufficient mining of bytecode-level smart contract features. Experiments comparing the method described in this research to comparable methods reveal that the strategy proposed in this study improves all types of indicators significantly.

217	虚拟经济	Teaching a Lean masterclass in the metaverse	Purpose This paper reports exploratory findings about teaching in the metaverse using a virtual reality (VR) platform and head-mounted displays. This paper addresses three research questions: Is the metaverse an appropriate platform for teaching Lean? What are the benefits and problems of this approach over traditional classroom methods? What are the future implications for teaching Lean in the VR-enabled metaverse? Design/methodology/approach The research presented in this paper is exploratory. A critical realism approach is adopted using action research through the preparation, delivery and review of the first four masterclasses entitled Leading Intelligent Lean offered by Gemba (formerly The Leadership Network). The data collection methods included a pre-workshop questionnaire, participant observation, focus groups and end-of-course surveys. Findings It was found that Lean can be taught successfully in the metaverse. There are many related benefits, particularly in terms of the high levels of immersion and the "wow" factor. Remaining technological limitations are reduced by continually improving the metaverse platform and the course content and delivery. The authors conclude that the metaverse is a useful addition to teaching Lean - and is especially promising when used in a blended teaching approach. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of teaching Lean in a VR-enabled metaverse and one of the first of teaching and learning in the metaverse regardless of topic. The respective problems and benefits of this approach versus teaching in a traditional classroom setting are discussed.	teaching;learning;lean;metaverse;virtual reality;vr;covid-19vr
218	虚拟经济	The Bifold Triadic Relationships Framework: A Theoretical Primer for Advertising Research in the Metaverse	The concept of the metaverse was first coined in the science fiction novel Snow Crash published 30 years ago, serving as the pregenesis concept of the next groundbreaking development in communication and technology fields for several decades. Today, the concept of the metaverse is complicated and often discussed as a multidimensional notion, generally referring to multiple interconnected virtual worlds where large numbers of users can simultaneously interact in embodied form. In this article, we propose the bifold triadic relationships model to help advertising scholars understand how advertising may work in the metaverse and to guide future research endeavors. Although the metaverse as a concept has yet to fully form, we hope that this primer presents a clearer layout of how advertising can be studied at the unit level of triadic relationships among consumer, media, and engagement behaviors in the metaverse space. Using what we know thus far about immersive virtual environments and how they relate to advertising practice and scholarship, the present article serves as an impetus for new directions in advertising theory and research in the metaverse in the years to come.	immersive virtual environments;augmented reality;brand attitude;digital twin;model;self;communication;involvement;media;gratifications

221	市场治理	Forecasting the Volatility of Cryptocurrencies in the Presence of COVID-19 with the State Space Model and Kalman Filter	During the COVID-19 pandemic, cryptocurrency prices showed abnormal volatility that attracted the participation of many investors. Studying the behaviour of volatility for the prices of cryptocurrency is an interesting problem to be investigated. This research implements the state space model framework for volatility incorporating the Kalman filter. This method directly forecasts the conditional volatility of five cryptocurrency prices (Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH)) for 10,000 consecutive hours, i.e., approximately 417 days during the COVID-19 pandemic from 26 February 2020, 00:00 h until 18 April 2021, 00:00 h. The performance of this model is compared to the GARCH (1,1) model and the neural network autoregressive (NNAR) based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and the volatility plot. The autocorrelation function plot, histogram and the residuals plot are used to examine the model adequacy. Among the three models, the state space model gives the best fit. The state space model gives the narrowest confidence interval of volatility and value-at-risk forecasts among the three models.	cryptocurrency;volatility;state space model;kalman filtertime-series;stationarity
222	市场治理	Hedging Bitcoin with conventional assets	The recent 50% drop in the price of the flagship cryptocurrency Bitcoin reinforces the persistent anxiety among cryptocurrency investors. Can alternative assets hedge Bitcoin risk? This study investigates the ability of equities, commodities, bonds, currencies, and VIX futures to hedge Bitcoin. Our in-sample analysis shows that the USDX, Gilt, Australian dollars, wheat, cocoa, cotton, sugar, copper, and lean hog can hedge Bitcoin, and the out-of-sample analysis reveals that the DAX, Dow-Jones, Nikkei, S&P 500, Brent, and WTI futures can be effective hedging instruments. We use a wavelet-based dynamic hedging model to account for heterogeneous investors in the Bitcoin market. For a short-term horizon, soybean futures reduce the variance in the in-sample hedged portfolio, and cotton futures offer the highest out-of-sample utility. Copper futures are the best for in-sample hedging in a long-term horizon, whereas live cattle futures have the best out-of-sample performance. These results show that conventional assets can hedge wild swings in Bitcoin. Copyright (C) 2021, Borsa Istanbul Anonim Sirketi.

223	平台项目	Bitcoin network measurement and a new approach to infer the topology	Bitcoin has made an increasing impact on the world's economy and financial order, which attracted extensive attention of researchers and regulators from all over the world. Most previous studies had focused more on the transaction layer, but less on the network layer. In this paper, we developed BNS(Bitcoin Network Sniffer), which could find and connect nodes in the Bitcoin network, and made a measurement in detail. We collected nearly 4.1 million nodes in 1.5 hours and identified 9,515 reachable nodes. We counted the reachable nodes' properties such as: service type, port number, client version and geographic distribution. In addition, we analyzed the stability of the reachable nodes in depth and found nearly 60% kept stable during 15 days. Finally, we proposed a new approach to infer the Bitcoin network topology by analyzing the Neighbor Addresses of Adjacent Nodes and their timestamps, which had an accuracy over 80%.	bitcoin;peer-to-peer computing;network topology;ip networks;topology;protocols;databases;bitcoin network;reachable nodes;node properties;node stability;network topologynodes
224	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Traceability System for Product Recall	In this paper, a blockchain-based framework involving a traceability system for product recall (TSPR) is proposed to develop a traceability system integrated into the product recall system deployed to the Ethereum to ensure the transparency and visibility of the recall process for all stakeholders. The proposed system incorporates all four stakeholders, including supply chain (SC) participants, the food safety regulatory system, the admin, and end customers, into one chain. In the proposed TSPR system, individual components are developed to provide primarily product traceability events, product recall data and status, which are stored in the blockchain to authorized stakeholders. Moreover, the entity relationship and activity diagram of the TSPR system are developed. In the experiment, three smart contracts of the TSPR system are developed using Remix IDE running on an Ethereum test network. A scenario of the events of product traceability and recall in the SC is developed. Two criteria are used to test the validation of contracts: the correct operation and measurement of gas costs. The results show the correctness of three smart contracts, thereby ensuring that the stakeholder chain is provided with visibility and transparency primarily for the product recall process. Moreover, the summation of gas costs deployed in the TSPR system in Ethereum Mainnet for the regulator and manufacturer is $30.23 and $111.54, respectively. However, when using the Polygon Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the gas cost remains $0.022 and $0.083, respectively; thus, this system for stakeholders may help them to achieve lower costs and increased economic worth.	traceability system;product recall;blockchain;ethereum smart contract
225	技术治理	SoK: Network-Level Attacks on the Bitcoin P2P Network	Over the last decade, Bitcoin has revolutionized the global economic and technological landscape, inspiring a new generation of blockchain-based technologies. Its protocol is today among the most influential for cryptocurrencies and distributed networks. In particular, the P2P layer represents a reference point for all permissionless blockchains, which often implement its solutions in their network layer. Unfortunately, the Bitcoin network protocol lacks a strong security model, leaving it exposed to several threats. Attacks at this level can affect the reliability and trustworthiness of the consensus layer, mining the credibility of the whole system. It is therefore of utmost importance to properly understand and address the security of the Bitcoin P2P protocol. In this paper, we give a comprehensive and detailed overview of known network-level attacks in Bitcoin, as well as the countermeasures that have been implemented in the protocol. We propose a generic network adversary model, and propose an objective-based taxonomy of the attacks. Finally, we identify the core weaknesses of the protocol and study the relationship between different types of attack. We believe our contribution can help both new and experienced researchers have a broader and deeper understanding of the Bitcoin P2P network and its threats, and allow for a better modeling of its security properties.	bitcoin;security;protocols;blockchains;consensus protocol;data mining;internet;economics;taxonomy;blockchain;bitcoin p2p network;bitcoin security;surveyblockchain
226	实体经济	Smart contract and IPFS-based trustworthy secure data storage and device authentication scheme in fog computing environment	The traditional Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) ecosystem utilizes the Trusted Third Party (TTP) to store sensitive data, and TTP acts as a middleware for device authentication. Therefore, maintaining data privacy is one of the main challenges and research issues due to third-party involvement. Moreover, several known challenges such as Single-Point-of-Failure (SPoF), trust issues, centralized systems, and security vulnerabilities exist in the IIoT ecosystem. Blockchain is one of the solutions to address above mentioned challenges. This article proposes a fully decentralized system (without TTP) based on the ethereum smart contracts and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for IIoT. Moreover, we propose a device authentication mechanism by utilizing smart contracts and storing the data in a distributed manner using IPFS. This work also provides data accessing policies for the end-users. The proposed contract is implemented in both JavaScript VM and ropsten test networks. It provides an in-depth analysis of the smart contract while simulating the contract in local and global environments. Moreover, the various costs involved in proposing the protocol are also calculated and compared to current studies. The informal investigation demonstrates that the solutions are secure and meet critical security criteria.	industrial internet-of-thing (iiot);blockchain;smart contract;ipfs;trust;securityblockchain
227	实体经济	A customer satisfaction centric food delivery system based on blockchain and smart contract	Food delivery systems are gaining popularity recently due to the expansion of internet connectivity and for the increasing availability of devices. The growing popularity of such systems has raised concerns regarding (i) Information security, (ii) Business to business (B2B) deep discounting race, and (iii) Strict policy enforcement. Sensitive personal data and financial information of the users must be safeguarded. Additionally, in pursuit of gaining profit, the restaurants tend to offer deep discounts resulting in a higher volume of orders than usual. Therefore, the restaurants and the delivery persons fail to maintain the delivery time and often impair the food quality. In this paper, we have proposed a blockchain and smart contract-based food delivery system to address these issues. The main goal is to remove commission schemes and decrease service delays caused by a high volume of orders. The protocols have been deployed and tested on the Ethereum test network. The simulation manifests a successful implementation of our desired system; with the payment being controlled by our system. The actors (restaurant, delivery-person or consumer) are bound to be compliant with the policies or penalized otherwise.	blockchain;smart contract;decentralized food delivery;commission business controliot

With the "carbon peak, carbon neutrality" goal and the proposal of a new power system, the construction of a power system in the metaverse is the trend of future development. For the application of the Metaverse in the power system, the Metaverse is recognized by means of digital twin technology, Internet of Things technology and other means, and then the energy storage power station system in the Metaverse is analyzed. To this end, this paper proposes a Metaverse-driven remote management scheme for energy storage power stations, and gives a specific design scheme. With the help of large-scale computing experiments and the parallel execution of virtual and real closed loops, the remote management and virtual-real interaction of the real energy storage power station system is realized, and the energy storage power station system is promoted from the management and control that relies on simulation to the intelligent management and control driven by the metaverse. In addition, in view of the demand of energy storage power station system for high-precision power load prediction, this paper also proposes a power load prediction model based on genetic algorithm-BP neural network. Considering the data characteristics, a scene-based classification model generation method is designed. The simulation results show that, compared with the BP neural network algorithm, the performance of the prediction model proposed in this paper has been significantly improved, and it can achieve effective prediction of power load.	metaverse;load prediction;bp-neural network;remote management

233	实体经济	Privacy Aware Internet of Medical Things Data Certification Framework on Healthcare Blockchain of 5G Edge	The 5G communication technology and edge computing jointly form 5G Edge and eliminate the constraints of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT) devices to facilitate several real-time healthcare services, including patient monitoring and diagnoses from anywhere. Nevertheless, the 5G Edge platform introduces risks of internal attacks to the data integrity and privacy of IoMT data. Hence, end users cannot trust data retrieved from the 5G Edge. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving search result certification framework for IoMT data on 5G and edge computing-assisted blockchain networks. The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, the proposed framework introduces a blockchain platform involving 5G Edge servers to ensure tamperproof data storage. In addition, an encrypted data storage model and a symmetric-key cryptography-based privacy-preserving search mechanism are developed for the 5G Edge blockchain. Second, the framework leverages an efficient multi-signature scheme to design a tamperproof search result certification mechanism for IoMT data on the blockchain of 5G Edge. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.	internet of medical things;iomt data privacy;smart medical systems;blockchain;privacy-preserving search;iomt data integrity;search result certification;query result verification;verifiable query;multi-signaturecloud;search;system;secure

235	协同技术	Exploiting Zero Knowledge Proof and Blockchains Towards the Enforcement of Anonymity, Data Integrity and Privacy (ADIP) in the IoT	In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been contemplated as the next technological advancement in the era of data communication and networking. However, although hundreds of new IoT platforms are introduced to the market every few months, the security of IoT ecosystems is still not fully understood. This paper discloses the architecture of a multilayer, multimode security system for the IoT. The proposed system is capable of providing multiple security solutions that support anonymous authentication, device privacy, data integrity, device sybil attack detection and IoT server spoofing attack detection. For IoT access control and authentication, our system can support two modes of operations, with one mode endorsing device privacy protection over the network and the second mode relinquishing device identity to establish data tracing during safety-critical IoT events. The new security system includes two innovative crypto approaches, zero knowledge proof (ZKP) and blockchains. IoT device anonymity was achieved via the multimode ZKP protocol, while data integrity and protection against sybil and IoT spoofing attacks were maintained via blockchains. Our threat analysis models showed that data modification and data injection attacks are not feasible. Probabilistic modeling of an IoT spoofing attack was performed in this paper, and the results show that our security system provides high resiliency against such attacks, with a probability approaching 1.	blockchains;servers;security;medical services;data privacy;authentication;internet of things;anonymity;blockchain;iot;sybil attacks;zkpsecurity;internet;scheme;health

Given the fact that communications in numerous IoT devices through wireless links are unreliable, blockchain technology, as a promising solution, has emerged to achieve reliable and secure sharing services in a decentralized manner. However, applying blockchain in large-scale wireless networks confronts scalability challenges. This motivates us to propose a real-time, trusted data interactive, and fine-grained transaction supportable sharing framework, the core of which is a novel two-layer scaling blockchain design. In the on-chain layer, sharing-oriented sharding is employed to enable secure and efficient processing of macro-transactions on the chain. In the off-chain layer, cross-zone off-chain channels are set up to provide real-time sharing transactions with high-frequency micro-trading scenarios. Finally, a proof-of-concept case study of electric vehicle sharing data is implemented with experimental results to demonstrate the feasibility of our framework.	
237	协同技术	SECURE AND TRUSTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OF THINGS	Empowered by promising artificial intelligence, the traditional Internet of Things is evolving into the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), which is an important enabling technology for Industry 4.0. Collaborative learning is a key technology for AIoT to build machine learning (ML) models on distributed datasets. However, there are two critical concerns of collaborative learning for AIoT: privacy leakage of sensitive data and dishonest computation. Specifically, data contains sensitive information of users, which cannot be openly shared for model learning. Furthermore, to protect the privacy of data or other selfish purposes, participants of collaborative learning may behave dishonestly, submitting dummy data or incorrect model computation. Therefore, it is important to guarantee privacy preservation of data and honest computation on collaborative learning. Our work tackles the two concerns wherein a model demander can securely train ML models with sensitive data and can regulate the computation of participants. To this end, we propose a secure and trusted collaborative learning framework called TrusCL. The framework guarantees privacy preservation via a delicate combination of homomorphic encryption (HE) and differential privacy (DP), achieving the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, based on blockchain, in our design, the key steps of secure collaborative learning are recorded on blockchain so that malicious behaviors can be effectively tracked and choked in a timely manner to facilitate trusted computation. Experimental results validate the trade-off performance of TrusCL between model training efficiency and trained model accuracy.

240	技术治理	Blockchain-Enabled Intrusion Detection and Prevention System of APTs Within Zero Trust Architecture	In a world where organisations are embracing new IT working models such as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and remote working, the traditional mindset of defending the network perimeter is no longer sufficient. Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has recently emerged as a new security model in which the breach mindset dominates the threat model. By default, the ZTA considers any endpoint (i.e., device), user, or application to be untrusted until proven otherwise. Nonetheless, once proven by the endpoint, using Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), attackers can still take over an authenticated and authorised session via that endpoint. Therefore, they can perform several user/device centric malicious activities in addition to lateral movement rendering the endpoint the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively deter APT attack capabilities on the endpoints, this work proposes a Blockchain-enabled Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (BIDPS) that augments ZTA onto endpoints. The BIDPS aims to achieve two core outcomes: first, detect and prevent attackers' techniques and tactics as per MITRE's ATT&CK enterprise matrix earlier than the lateral movement stage, and secondly, strip trust out of the endpoint itself and place it on-chain, thus creating an immutable system of explicit trust. To evaluate the effectiveness of the BIDPS, a testbed was built where techniques of over ten APTs attacks were launched against the endpoint. BIDPS has a high rate of success defending against the launched attacks owing to its Blockchain's immutability, fortifying the detection/prevention processes.	blockchains;monitoring;peer-to-peer computing;distributed ledger;smart contracts;intrusion detection;computer architecture;security;advanced persistent threats;blockchain;endpoints;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;security;mitre's att&ck;zero trust
241	实体经济	Application of Edge Computing and Blockchain in Smart Agriculture System	The development of Internet technology provides a lot of convenience for the promotion of smart agriculture. At present, smart agriculture has gradually realized unmanned and automatic management, which can realize monitoring, supervision, and real-time image monitoring. However, the data in smart agriculture system cannot be guaranteed to be complete and vulnerable to attack. Based on this, this paper studies and analyzes the application of edge computing and blockchain in smart agriculture systems. Based on the simple analysis of the development of smart agriculture, the edge computing framework and the advantages of blockchain are used to build the framework system of smart agriculture. The classical architecture of edge computing and the confidentiality of blockchain are used to realize the analysis and storage of data. In view of the shortcomings of crop image overlap detection, it is proposed to detect the overlapping area and determine the feature points to analyze the image based on the edge computing and hash algorithm. In terms of data integrity, based on the advantages of blockchain, an edge data detection method based on short signature is proposed, and experiments are designed to analyze the accuracy and efiectiveness of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the image mosaic algorithm can extract the contour information of the image and realize the fast image matching. The edge data integrity calculation based on short signature can meet the requirements and shorten the response time.	management
242	协同技术	Adoption of Federated Learning for Healthcare Informatics: Emerging Applications and Future Directions	The smart healthcare system has improved the patients quality of life (QoL), where the records are being analyzed remotely by distributed stakeholders. It requires a voluminous exchange of data for disease prediction via the open communication channel, i.e., the Internet to train artificial intelligence (AI) models efficiently and effectively. The open nature of communication channels puts data privacy at high risk and affects the model training of collected data at centralized servers. To overcome this, an emerging concept, i.e., federated learning (FL) is a viable solution. It performs training at client nodes and aggregates their results to train the global model. The concept of local training preserves the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the patient's data which contributes effectively to the training process. The applicability of FL in the healthcare domain has various advantages, but it has not been explored to its extent. The existing surveys majorly focused on the role of FL in diverse applications, but there exists no detailed or comprehensive survey on FL in healthcare informatics (HI). We present a relative comparison of recent surveys with the proposed survey. To strengthen healthcare data privacy and increase the QoL of patients, we proposed an FL-based layered healthcare informatics architecture along with the case study on FL-based electronic health records (FL-EHR). We discuss the emerging FL models, and present the statistical and security challenges in FL adoption in medical setups. Thus, the review presents useful insights for both academia and healthcare practitioners to investigate FL application in HI ecosystems.	medical services;data privacy;biological system modeling;data models;computational modeling;servers;bioinformatics;blockchains;informatics;aggregation;gradient methods;collaborative work;blockchain;federated learning;healthcare informatics;gradient;model aggregationblockchain;challenges;privacy;6g;communication;networks;iot
243	核心技术	A New Secure Crowdfunding Transaction Scheme Based on Blockchain	Online crowdfunding, an innovative model based on "Internet + Finance", is a hot spot for financing via Internet. Crowdfunding based on blockchain is an emerging economic phenomenon and becomes one of the most advanced risk financing strategies. However, crowdfunding transactions face security threats due to identity leaks, quantum attacks and the untraceable nature of blind signatures, which facilitate criminal activity. Different from the previous works, which ignored the importance of traceability, in this paper, we establish a blockchain-empowered secure crowdfunding architecture and propose an anti-quantum partially blind signature algorithm based on the verifiable identity of both sides. Specially, for one thing, the private key decided by user identity is generated by lattice-based sample matrix, and the privacy of user identity can be ensured and traced by the rejection sampling theorem. For another thing, we design an improved krill herd algorithm (IKHA) to increase the credit factor of fundraisers for dealing with project investment issues. The simulation evaluates the correctness and effectiveness of our theoretical analyses. Compared with the current popular schemes, the proposed IKH algorithm has a higher convergence speed and can optimize investment efficiency.	blockchain;crowdfunding;partially blind signature (pbs);improved krill herd algorithmperformance
244	实体经济	Ultra-Lightweight and Secure Blockchain-Assisted Charging Scheduling Scheme for Vehicular Edge Networks by Utilization of NanoPi NEO	In vehicular edge computing networks, electric vehicles can get charging services from edge servers through some road-side charging stations. Several recent studies have investigated how to deal with security requirements in these communications. Nevertheless, simultaneous provision of security and lightness, which is crucial for resource-constrained vehicles, is still an open issue. More critically, the anonymity from the perspective of honest-but-curious edge nodes has not been yet addressed. Thus, this paper proposes a novel ultra-lightweight framework for the secure and anonymous communications of vehicles during their charging reception by means of blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain technology, the accountability of electric vehicle possessors guaranteed. The proposed scheme has been validated in terms of security metrics and also implemented on two ARM-based platforms, one 32-bit ARM microcontroller and one 64-bit ARM processor. Further, its blockchain part has been deployed on a Hyperledger Fabric network. The obtained results besides the comparison with well-respected similar schemes acknowledge the usefulness and practicability of the presented scheme.	servers;electric vehicles;blockchains;authentication;privacy;edge computing;smart contracts;blockchain;edge computing;privacy;secure communications;vehicular networksauthentication

246	核心技术	A public blockchain consensus mechanism for fault-tolerant distributed computing in LEO satellite communications	In LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite communication systems, the satellite network is made up of a large number of satellites, the dynamically changing network environment affects the results of distributed computing. In order to improve the fault tolerance rate, a novel public blockchain consensus mechanism that applies a distributed computing architecture in a public network is proposed. Redundant calculation of blockchain ensures the credibility of the results; and the transactions with calculation results of a task are stored distributed in sequence in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). The transactions issued by nodes are connected to form a net. The net can quickly provide node reputation evaluation that does not rely on third parties. Simulations show that our proposed blockchain has the following advantages: 1. The task processing speed of the blockchain can be close to that of the fastest node in the entire blockchain; 2. When the tasks' arrival time intervals and demanded working nodes(WNs) meet certain conditions, the network can tolerate more than 50% of malicious devices; 3. No matter the number of nodes in the blockchain is increased or reduced, the network can keep robustness by adjusting the task's arrival time interval and demanded WNs.	distributed computing;public blockchain network;consensus mechanism;credibility;fault-toleranceperformance analysis
247	协同技术	Blockchain-based Authentication and Proof-of-Reputation Mechanism for Trust Data Sharing in Internet of Vehicles	Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology with storage and computing capabilities and deployed at the edge of the network, is widely used to solve the problems of high bandwidth, low latency and high mobility for the Internet of vehicles (IoV). Edge computing servers are generally deployed on road side unit (RSU). However, since the vehicles need to share data and collaborate on computations through RSUs, RSUs may be attacked by malicious vehicles which take up RSU resources or gain control of RSU. Therefore, a trust management system needs to be designed to build a secure and trustworthy MEC data-sharing envi-ronment in IoV. Most of the previous studies have centralized authen-tication of vehicle identity through certificate authority (CA), which has the risk of privacy leakage. In addition, in the previously proposed blockchain-based distributed trust management schemes, the consensus mechanism consumes huge resources. Therefore, this paper proposes an autonomous and controllable distributed authentication scheme based on decentralized identifier (DID) to ensure the credibility of the vehi-cle's identity, and a novel proof-of-reputation consensus mechanism based on blockchain to enhance trust management for RSU. And this paper considers the capability and reputation value of RSU and uses the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the assignment of ver-ification nodes, block size and block interval in order to maximize the transaction throughput and improve system scalability and efficiency. The experiment shows that our scheme has good results for building a trusted data sharing system for vehicular networks.	blockchain;reputation management;authentication;pbft;markov decision process;internet of vehiclesresource-allocation;edge;architecture;networks;systems
248	实体经济	Secured blind digital certificate and Lamport Merkle cloud assisted medical image sharing using blockchain	In the standard Electronic Health Record (EHR) management system, the medical service center supervises and dispenses the corresponding health records that are found to be a laborious process for sharing on several medical platforms. In recent years, blockchain technology has started gaining as one of the most favored possibilities based on dissimilar platforms to share EHRs. However, with the increased nature and size of the EHR storing data also involves a tedious process. The computation and communication cost are the challenges involved in accessing medical image information is not analyzed. The falsification rate for HER was not focused. To sort out this issue, the cloud computing (CC) environment is contemplated as an encouraging solution. Woefully, the EHR with CC environment is found to be susceptible to several attacks due to the sending of sensitive medical image data over a public channel. A secured method with Blind Digital Certificate and Lamport Merkle (BBDC-LM) Cloud-assisted Medical Image Sharing using Blockchain is proposed in our work. In the proposed BBDC-LM method, blockchain performs the task of access control and therefore ensuring security and minimum falsification of the entire process. Blind Digital Certificate is used for generating keys to contribute communication and computational cost. On the other hand, the cloud server stores and manages the patient's five different classes of images (i.e., MRI, CT, X-ray, Annotated, and Ultrasound) to provide computationally efficient storage. The empirical results show that our proposed BBDC-LM method provides an efficient solution for reliable medical image data sharing between patients and medical analyzers in a secured manner. Lamport Merkle functions where the leaves from the authentication among patient and medical analyzer are performed by cloud server. The system evaluation and security analysis also demonstrate the performance improvements in minimum communication and computation cost with a minimum false positive rate compared to the existing medical image sharing methods.	electronic health record;cloud computing environment;blockchain;blind digital certificate;lamport merkle;authenticationsystem
249	协同技术	Sharded Blockchain for Collaborative Computing in the Internet of Things: Combined of Dynamic Clustering and Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	Immutability, decentralization, and linear promoted scalability make the sharded blockchain a promising solution, which can effectively address the trust issue in the large-scale Internet of Things (IoT). However, currently, the throughput of sharded blockchains is still limited when it comes to high proportion of cross-shard transactions (CSTs). On the other hand, the assemblage characteristic of the collaborative computing in IoT has not been received attention. Therefore, in this article, we present a clustering-based sharded blockchain strategy for collaborative computing in the IoT, where the sharding of the blockchain system is implemented in two steps: K-means-clustering-based user grouping and the assignment of consensus nodes. In this framework, how to reasonably group the IoT users while simultaneously guaranteeing the system performance is the key point. Specifically, we describe the data transactions among IoT devices by data transaction flow graph (DTFG) based on a dynamic stochastic block model. Then, formed as a Markov decision process (MDP), the optimization of the cluster number (shard number) and the adjustment of consensus parameters are jointly trained by deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the scalability of the sharded blockchain in the IoT application.	collaborative computing;deep reinforcement learning (drl);dynamic graph analysis;internet of things (iot);k-means clustering;sharded blockchainscalable access management;iot;consensus;optimization;reputation
250	协同技术	Multi-criteria approach for handling sophisticated data transmission over gateways in blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) federated networks	In the real-world scenario, the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain federated networks implicate smart devices for gathering the data and then directing the data to the destined nodes through gateway devices. A gateway usually supports a number of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) irrespective of their underlying communication technologies. Furthermore, a gateway usually supports a number of WSNs with blockchain master nodes, which employ diverse communication technologies. As a result, gateways are meant to play a versatile role without worrying about the underlying architecture, hardware, and software details of the connecting nodes in blockchain federated networks. This paper proposes a two-phased methodology for blockchain and IoT federated networks where efficient link selection based on a multi-criteria-based approach is performed. The dynamic gateway scheduling strategy is capable enough to support blockchain-based transactions as well as communication in IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed methodology enhances data transfer fairness for each gateway, resulting in efficient data transmission. Machine learning (ML) methods are also devised to analyze the status of the communication channels before employing the link selection mechanism. Then the selection of links is performed based on multi-criteria statistical techniques. Finally, the scheduling is performed for selecting the appropriate gateway for channelizing the blockchain data speedily. The selection of links is made based on the dynamic status of the links. The usage of time series ML methods such as LSTM is made to predict the upcoming traffic on the links. Multiple criteria-based statistical approaches are utilized for the selection of the link optimally. Finally, the scheduling is performed to fulfil the criteria of 6G networks, where network users are rewarded with seamless connectivity and uninterrupted services. The efficacy of the proposed two-phased mechanism is demonstrated through simulation results. The results are demonstrated with respect to the total data conveyed, packet delivery ratio (PDR), energy consumed by the links, and throughput of the network. The PDR obtained by the proposed work for the high volume of data is 93% and for the low volume of data is 97%. The packet delay is reduced by 21% for low volume data and 19% for high volume data by the proposed methods. The data transmission is also optimized remarkably by the proposed method. The proposed fairness-driven mechanism (FDM) is compared with the state-of-the-art methods to prove the viability and robustness of the two-phased proposed mechanism of link selection for data transmission over blockchain and IoT federated networks.	blockchain;internet of things (iot);iot gateways (igws);sixth generation (6g) networks;solution specific gateways (ssgws)
251	协同技术	Risk-Based Access Control Mechanism for Internet of Vehicles Using Artificial Intelligence	Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks because of the lack of security measures. IoV systems can be infiltrated by malicious and unauthorized nodes, which can cause the authenticity, accessibility, and privacy of shared information resources to be compromised. Indeed, the use of an access control system can help; as a result, it is unable to respond to such attacks on time. This paper introduces an artificial intelligence-enabled access control mechanism (AI-ACM) with vehicle nodes and roadside units (RSUs) to overcome these issues. Here, use vehicle nodes as lightweight nodes, while RSUs act as comprehensive and edge nodes to provide access control service. A generative adversarial network (GAN) is used in place of risk prediction (RP) due to the lack of training sets, resulting in a sequence generation rather than an accurate risk prediction. Afterward, the blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (BIoV) approach is summarized for the security mechanisms of vehicles that are discussed from the aspects of access control and authentication to sustain the distributed processing architecture and solve security issues. The simulation results show that AI-ACM is more accurate than the previous GANs at predicting the future. In addition, the RP model's access control accuracy can be improved as a result of this technique.	avoidance;scheme;system

Based on the analysis on 597 cryptocurrencies from 2014 to 2020, our findings show that static investor attention improves cryptocurrency market liquidity over the next three months by attracting more investors into the market and stimulating buy and sell transactions. By contrast, abnormal attention persistently and negatively affects the liquidity and leads to excessive net buying pressure in the market and a crowded buyers' market, resulting in a sharp deterioration of liquidity. Moreover, these effects intensify during low global economic policy uncertainty periods and for cryptocurrencies with small market capitalization and low idiosyncratic volatility. Overall, our results have important implications for investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers.	cryptocurrency markets;investor attention;liquidity;investor trading behaviorcross-section;returns evidence;stock returns;preference;skewness;demand;search;bias

255	市场治理	Discussion of "Currency Stability Using Blockchain Technology"	The volatility of crypto currencies hinders their ability to be media of exchange or stores of value, leading to the implementation of exchange-rate pegs in an attempt to stabilize these currencies. This strategy has been used by crypto currencies such as US Dollar Tether, Steem Backed Dollar and TrueUSD; and was previously adopted in countries such as Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. However, an exchange-rate peg is vulnerable to speculative attacks if it is not 100% backed by reserves, as discussed in Obstfeld (1996). Using insights from the bank-run literature, Routledge and Zetlin-Jones (2018) build on Green and Lin (2003) and propose a model of speculative attacks. They show that adjustments to the exchange rate can prevent speculative attacks in equilibrium. They also show how to implement such contracts using blockchain technology. In this discussion paper, I provide a cautionary tale. I show also in a version of Green and Lin (2003) that the information content in the blockchain prevents agents from attaining all the gains from risk sharing-highlighting the downsides of too much public information.

256	实体经济	A crop yield prediction model based on an improved artificial neural network and yield monitoring using a blockchain technique	Nowadays, improving a crop yield (C-Y) is an emerging and essential task to reduce food scarcity. Factors impacting C-Y improvement include rising population, water shortage, fertilizer use, climate change and unprecedented insect attacks. To resolve these issues, a smart agriculture technique is proposed in this work. Internet of Things (IoT) sensor devices are used to collect data from farms, following which the fuzzy association rule-based classification technique classifies the data into two, valuable and nonvaluable. An improved artificial neural network (IANN) algorithm is applied to identify and analyze the factors involved in monitoring C-Y's. Thereafter, all valuable data pertaining to the type of seed, fertilizer and crop cost is stored in blocks to secure data and communication between members of the farming community. Finally, an edge computing device is used to store the blocks and transfer information. The valuable data collected is classified using the fuzzy association rule and analyzed using the IANN technique, both of which facilitate a comparison with the historical data so as to enable better decision making in terms of seed and fertilizer selection. Similarly, crop price is predicted through a comparison of present and historical yields. To overcome breaches in security, a blockchain technique is employed in this work to secure communication between farmers, investors and merchants. The investor dispatches instructions on the selection of the seed and fertilizer, as well as the crop cost, through the blockchain to the farmer and the merchant. Such secure communication bypasses third-party involvement and inconsistencies in the data. When compared to the traditional method, the proposed technique offers better accuracy and profits, right from seed selection to trading. The proposed IANN technique produced a higher yield than the traditional method with a profit of 51%, 35% and 20% for rice, bananas and flowers, respectively. Similarly, the IANN technique provides 99.15% prediction accuracy in terms of a profit analysis. The blockchain and edge computing-based transactions improve security and reduce transactional latency. The proposed system ensures sustainability and traceability in agriculture.	crop yield prediction;random forest;artificial neural network;agriculture yield;cloud storage;internet of things;blockchain;fuzzy and association rulesprecision agriculture;system
257	实体经济	Smart Integrated Decentralization Strategies of Solar Power System in Buildings	This study signifies the need for a smart integrated decentralized solar energy system in Pakistan. Since the outlook of energy is highly dominated by its power sector, policy measures must be adopted to ensure its penetration in the system of any country. After the industrial, the housing sector is the major energy-consuming sector. The goal of this study is to assess energy generation through a smart integrated decentralized solar energy system in the power hub of a commercial area in Taxila, Pakistan. Model development involves a hypothetical model built on LabVIEW which allows the user interface a way to intermingle with the source code. It permits the user to the transformation of the values sent to the source code and sees the information that the source code calculates. The proposed system is a collaborative sharing integrated decentralized solar system that credits sunlight-based energy framework proprietors for the power they add to different buildings due to the collaborative sharing mechanism at Rs.10 per kWh. This low-cost electricity is available at your doorstep that you can share according to the collaborative sharing basis that will not range any certain variable. Results from the literature describe that 30% of the cost associated with the commercial price of electricity amounts to distribution cost. This system of the utilization of energy would be applied at a local level to achieve the maximum power generation from solar panels through blockchain use of solar systems, especially in regions that have no entrance to traditional power with little odds of getting associated in the next 5-10 years.

With the continuous expansion of the scale of university laboratories, the number of managers is also increasing, but the management of laboratories is still in the exploratory stage. The current laboratory information management system of Internet of Things has high degree of data heterogeneity, poor data interoperability, and difficult guarantee of data privacy, all of which lead to the difficulty in mining the data value of Internet of Things. The decentralized and zero-trust architecture of blockchain subverted the traditional centralized system architecture and has been applied in many aspects. Blockchain technology was a good addition to IOT to improve the privacy security, versatility, and reliability of the network. This thesis developed an IOT information management system for smart labs based on blockchain technology and the Internet of Things. The data processing efficiency, accuracy, and system throughput are compared with the original IOT laboratory information management system. The results showed that compared with the current laboratory IOT information management system, this system had higher speed, higher efficiency, and better performance in processing the information and data.	iot
260	实体经济	Fortifying Smart Transportation Security Through Public Blockchain	Smart vehicles-enabled intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports a wide range of applications, such as, but not limited to, traffic planning and management, collision avoidance alert system, automated road speed enforcement, electronic toll collection, and real-time parking management, to name a few. However, it suffers from various types of security and privacy issues due to insecure communication among the entities over public channels. Therefore, an efficient and lightweight security mechanism is essential to protect the data that is both at rest as well as in transit. To this direction, we propose a public blockchain-envisioned secure communication framework for ITS (PBSCF-ITS). The proposed PBSCF-ITS guarantees access control and key management among the vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to roadside unit, and roadside unit to cloud server. We analyze the security of PBSCF-ITS to prove its resilience against various types of possible attacks. Furthermore, the performance of PBSCF-ITS with other related competing schemes has been compared. The obtained results illustrate that PBSCF-ITS outperforms the existing ones. Additionally, the pragmatic study of PBSCF-ITS is conducted to check its influence on various network-related performance parameters, like the number of mined blocks and transactions per block.	security;blockchains;servers;computational modeling;authentication;cloud computing;accidents;access control and key management;blockchain;intelligent transportation system (its);security;vehicular networkkey agreement scheme;user authentication scheme;management protocol;internet;sensor;mechanism;vehicles;framework;design

One of the major challenges in a CAV environment is handling the positional-forgery of Basic Safety Messages while calculating critical traffic gaps at a Stop Sign Gap Assist controlled intersection. Traditionally, positional-forgery has been handled by isolated instances of physical layer detection and correction mechanisms, which proved unreliable during the multi-hop and majority malicious vehicle scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Positional-forgEry Resistant traFfic gap Estimation for Connected inTersection management (PERFECT) that performs optimal traffic gap estimation even during multi-hop scenarios and majority malicious positional-forgery attacks. The framework reduces traffic gap estimation error during majority malicious scenarios by over 60%, keeps the average error within 8.17%-10.62% and minimizes the maximum error across a range of malicious situations.	blockchains;distance measurement;reliability;laser radar;estimation error;computational modeling;clustering algorithms;connected and autonomous vehicles;forgery;group recommendation;security;stop sign gap assist;trust model;vehicle-to-everythingemergency message dissemination;trust model;secure;blockchain
262	核心技术	A Hybrid Encryption Scheme for Quantum Secure Video Conferencing Combined with Blockchain	Traditional video conference systems depend largely on computational complexity to ensure system security, but with the development of high-performance computers, the existing encryption system will be seriously threatened. To solve this problem, a hybrid encryption scheme for quantum secure video conferencing combined with blockchain is proposed in this study. In the system solution architecture, first, the quantum key distribution network is embedded in the classic network; then, the "classical + quantum" hybrid encryption scheme is designed according to the secret level required for the video conference content. Besides, the real-time monitoring module of the quantum key distribution network is designed to ensure that users can check the running state of the network at any time. Meeting minutes can be shared by combining with blockchain. In order to quickly query meeting minutes, a cache-efficient query method based on B+ tree is proposed. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional video conference system, the quantum secure video conference system sufficiently integrates the technical advantages of the quantum key distribution to resist the security threats such as channel eavesdropping and high-performance computational attacks while ensuring the stable operation of the classic system, thus providing a video conference system with a higher security level. Meanwhile, the query time cost of blockchain with different lengths is tested, and the query efficiency of the proposed method is 3.15-times higher than the original query efficiency of blockchain.	video conference systems;quantum key;blockchain;hybrid encryption
263	实体经济	Analysis on the evolution of shipping logistics service supply chain market structure under the application of blockchain technology	With the digital transformation of the shipping industry, the business potential of shipping companies is gradually expanding. In recent years, shipping companies have begun operating freight forwarding businesses powered by the advantages of cost and network. As a result, their business expansion and gradually occupying the market share of agency services. At the same time, the development requirements of digitization are further highlighted, while the problems of opaque information and inaccurate data in the operation of the shipping logistics service supply chain have become more prominent. Thus, the shipping industry has begun to apply Blockchain Technology (BCT) to the shipping logistics. However, the promotion of BCT, an emerging technology in the shipping logistics service market, is not systematic. The members of the supply chain do not have a deep understanding of it, which have led to changes in market demand. We take the shipping logistics service supply chain composed of shipping companies and freight forwarders as the research object in order to investigate the vertical competition between shipping companies and freight forwarders as well as the impact of BCT application on market structure changes. From the perspectives of freight rate competition and the promotion of BCT, the Stackelberg game theory is applied to create a mathematical model that can be used to discuss the evolution of the shipping logistics service market. The results indicate that, the impact of freight rate competition on market evolution is reduced after the application of BCT. Shipping companies should actively promote BCT to reduce the impact of freight competition on the market. Furthermore, freight forwarders can actively participate in the initial stage of application to increase market demand, and the cost of promoting BCT should be reduced in the later stage.	shipping logistics service supply chain;blockchain technology;market structurepricing strategies;competition;lines;intention;transport;models;choice;roles
264	核心技术	Scaling proof-of-authority protocol to improve performance and security	Following the widespread application of blockchain, a variety of consensus protocols have been proposed recently for different scenarios. Proof of Authority (PoA) is a newly proposed Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocol for permissioned blockchains. It relies on a set of trusted nodes to generate blocks and adopts the longest-chain rule to reach consensus. However, the protocol suffers from performance and security issues due to its simple design. This paper proposes CoPoA, a novel proof-of-authority protocol that aims to improve performance and security. In terms of performance, we allow all authority nodes to generate blocks concurrently and process all types of blocks to improve throughput and feedback their blockchain information to the rest of the nodes on time to provide fast confirmation. In terms of security, we select the leader by a random number and set a tight confirmation boundary to protect the protocol from attack. We make a theoretical analysis to prove the safety and liveness properties of the protocol and demonstrate its performance through a prototype implementation and multiple tests. In our experiments, when the number of authority nodes is 9, CoPoA achieves 2x throughput improvement and 5x latency reduction compared to the original PoA protocol.	proof-of-authority;consensus protocol;permissioned blockchain;concurrency techniques
265	核心技术	Formal verification of persistence and liveness in the trust-based blockchain crowdsourcing consensus protocol	Crowdsourcing is a potential computing paradigm that exploits collective human intelligence to solve complex tasks, but it suffers from various safety and security problems. Blockchain has emerged as a promising technology to address most of the security issues, however, it is challenging to find an appropriate and trusted blockchain-based consensus protocol for crowdsourcing services. This work proposes a novel Trust-based Blockchain Crowdsourcing consensus protocol that selects a leader and validators based on various trust factors. The proposed protocol addresses a major issue of ensuring correctness associated with the safety and security-critical systems which has a vital importance because failure of such systems may lead to adverse consequences. Mainly it is focused on persistence and liveness properties preventing invalid block insertion and consensus delay attacks. Model checking technique is utilized because of its effectiveness and automatic nature to perform formal verification. The proposed protocol is specified using Communicating Sequential Programs, and the persistence and liveness properties are specified through Linear Temporal Logic. The model verification is performed by giving the formal model and the properties as input to the Process Analysis Toolkit which checks for the satisfaction or violation of the properties.	blockchain;crowdsourcing;model checking;persistence;livenesscyber-physical systems;chain

Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a structured review of the academic literature to identify and assess papers providing empirical insight on operational blockchain applications. The authors complement the findings from this review with primary empirical data from 11 interviews with blockchain providers, users and experts involved in four recent projects. Findings The paper presents an integrated research framework that illustrates the impact of blockchain on supply chain performance. The findings highlight that blockchain can affect supply chain performance directly - via one of its core technological features - and indirectly via the broader business project through which blockchain technology is implemented. Practical implications Insights from this paper should provide managers with a more nuanced understanding of how blockchain technology can be leveraged to address important supply chain management challenges. Originality/value Prior research addressing the relationship between blockchain and supply chain performance mostly discusses potential performance effects of blockchain, presents individual blockchain applications and/or provides little explanation for how the core technological features of blockchain affect supply chain performance. This paper systematically assesses the ways in which blockchain can affect supply chain performance. In doing so, it goes beyond the initial hype around blockchain technology while countering some of the more recent critiques.	blockchain;supply chain management;empirical study;information systemstechnology;management;framework;networks;industry

Such technology has several typical characteristics, such as openness, automation, independence, security, sharing, and modularity. The logistics system is greatly beneficial from such characteristics. Therefore, blockchain technology can provide core technical support for the construction of logistics supply chain system. In this paper, we focus on the current demands of "blockchain + logistics" business system and reduce half risks in the supply chain through decentralization and detrusting of blockchain technology.

269	实体经济	BlockCrime: Blockchain and Deep Learning-Based Collaborative Intelligence Framework to Detect Malicious Activities for Public Safety	Detecting malicious activity in advance has become increasingly important for public safety, economic stability, and national security. However, the disparity in living standards incites the minds of certain undesirable members of society to commit crimes, which may disrupt society's stability and mental calm. Breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) make it feasible to address such challenges and construct a complete intelligent framework that automatically detects such malicious behaviors. Motivated by this, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Xception model, i.e., BlockCrime, to detect crimes and improve public safety. Furthermore, we integrate blockchain technology to securely store the detected crime scene locations and alert the nearest law enforcement authorities. Due to the scarcity of the dataset, transfer learning has been preferred, in which a CNN-based Xception model is used. The redesigned Xception architecture is evaluated against various assessment measures, including accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall, where it outperforms existing CNN architectures in terms of train accuracy, i.e., 96.57%.	convolutional neural network;deep learning;transfer learning;blockchain;smart contracts;public safety
270	协同技术	Blockchain-Enabled Network Sharing for O-RAN in 5G and Beyond	The innovation provided by network virtualization in 5G, together with standardization and openness boosted by the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance, has paved the way to a collaborative future in cellular systems, driven by flexible network sharing. Such advents are expected to attract new players like content providers and verticals, increasing competitiveness in the telecom market. However, scalability and trust issues are expected to arise, given the criticality of ownership traceability and resource exchanging in a sharing ecosystem. To address that, we propose integrating blockchain technology for enabling mobile operators and other players to exchange radio access network (RAN) resources (e.g., infrastructure) in the form of virtual network functions autonomously and dynamically. Blockchain will provide automation, robustness, trustworthiness, and reliability to mobile networks, thus bringing confidence to open RAN environments. In particular, we define a novel O-RAN-based blockchain-enabled architecture that allows automating RAN sharing procedures through either auction or marketplace-based mechanisms. The potential advantages of the proposed solution are demonstrated through simulation results. The used simulation platform is openly released.	blockchains;computer architecture;5g mobile communication;radio access networks;automation;microprocessors;smart contractsmanagement;framework

272	协同技术	On the Integration of Blockchain and SDN: Overview, Applications, and Future Perspectives	Blockchain (BC) and software-defined networking (SDN) are leading technologies which have recently found applications in several network-related scenarios and have consequently experienced a growing interest in the research community. Indeed, current networks connect a massive number of objects over the Internet and in this complex scenario, to ensure security, privacy, confidentiality, and programmability, the utilization of BC and SDN have been successfully proposed. In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey regarding these two recent research trends and review the related state-of-the-art literature. We first describe the main features of each technology and discuss their most common and used variants. Furthermore, we envision the integration of such technologies to jointly take advantage of these latter efficiently. Indeed, we consider their group-wise utilization-named BC-SDN-based on the need for stronger security and privacy. Additionally, we cover the application fields of these technologies both individually and combined. Finally, we discuss the open issues of reviewed research and describe potential directions for future avenues regarding the integration of BC and SDN. To summarize, the contribution of the present survey spans from an overview of the literature background on BC and SDN to the discussion of the benefits and limitations of BC-SDN integration in different fields, which also raises open challenges and possible future avenues examined herein. To the best of our knowledge, compared to existing surveys, this is the first work that analyzes the aforementioned aspects in light of a broad BC-SDN integration, with a specific focus on security and privacy issues in actual utilization scenarios.	blockchain;software defined networking;bc-sdn integration;security;privacy;confidentiality;internet of thingssoftware-defined networking;privacy issues;security;internet;iot;architecture;challenges;management;things;authentication

274	协同技术	AI-driven network softwarization scheme for efficient message exchange in IoT environment beyond 5G	Internet of things (IoT) has massively adopted the market due to the current era demanding fully intelligent and autonomous services. However, efficient network management and message exchange are challenging in a dynamic and energy-constrained IoT environment. Hence, for efficient message passing in IoT applications, softwarization of the IoT network is essential, wherein the logical control plane is decoupled from the data plane consisting of hardware devices such as routers and switches. Using softwarization, a centralized software-defined networking (SDN) controller is responsible for routing data packets from source to destination in a dynamic environment. However, to reduce the computational overhead of filtering malicious and nonmalicious packets, artificial intelligence (AI) classifiers prove beneficial. Moreover, such challenges have trade-offs with network requirements such as ultralow latency, high reliability, and higher data rates. Motivated by this, we propose an AI-enabled network softwarization scheme for efficient message exchange under the 6G network. Lastly, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated with different performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, f1-score, packet drop ratio, and latency. The empirical result revealed that the proposed scheme outperforms in terms of accuracy and controller efficiency, that is, 81.64% and 82.2%, respectively.	6g network;artificial intelligence;internet of things;lstm;network softwarization;software-defined networkingcontrol plane;routing protocol;sdn;communication;blockchain;security
275	协同技术	Enabling Blockchain Services for IoE with Zk-Rollups	The Internet of Things includes all connected objects from small embedded systems with low computational power and storage capacities to efficient ones, as well as moving objects like drones and autonomous vehicles. The concept of Internet of Everything expands upon this idea by adding people, data and processing. The adoption of such systems is exploding and becoming ever more significant, bringing with it questions related to the security and the privacy of these objects. A natural solution to data integrity, confidentiality and single point of failure vulnerability is the use of blockchains. Blockchains can be used as an immutable data layer for storing information, avoiding single point of failure vulnerability via decentralization and providing strong security and cryptographic tools for IoE. However, the adoption of blockchain technology in such heterogeneous systems containing light devices presents several challenges and practical issues that need to be overcome. Indeed, most of the solutions proposed to adapt blockchains to devices with low resources confront difficulty in maintaining decentralization or security. The most interesting are probably the Layer 2 solutions, which build offchain systems strongly connected to the blockchain. Among these, zk-rollup is a promising new generation of Layer 2/off-chain schemes that can remove the last obstacles to blockchain adoption in IoT, or more generally, in IoE. By increasing the scalability and enabling rule customization while preserving the same security as the Layer 1 blockchain, zk-rollups overcome restrictions on the use of blockchains for IoE. Despite their promises illustrated by recent systems proposed by startups and private companies, very few scientific publications explaining or applying this barely-known technology have been published, especially for non-financial systems. In this context, the objective of our paper is to fill this gap for IoE systems in two steps. We first propose a synthetic review of recent proposals to improve scalability including onchain (consensus, blockchain organization, horizontal ellipsis ) and offchain (sidechain, rollups) solutions and we demonstrate that zk-rollups are the most promising ones. In a second step, we focus on IoE by describing several interesting features (scalability, dynamicity, data management, horizontal ellipsis ) that are illustrated with various general IoE use cases.	iot;ioe;blockchain;rollup;zero-knowledge;zk-rollup;scalabilityinternet

277	市场治理	Trading cryptocurrencies using algorithmic average true range systems	This research makes the first attempt to design, optimize and use average true range (ATR)-based trading systems for five popular cryptocurrencies. We used particle swarm optimization procedures to optimize systems with multiple objectives that are based on the ATR concept. Our aim was to determine the best configurations for each system that would maximize net profits, the profit factor, and the percentage of profitable trades. We demonstrate that the ATR-based systems can predict the price trends of the examined cryptocurrencies. Our results also indicate that optimized Keltner Channel-based systems improve the ability of the stand-alone optimized ATR systems to forecast trends, net profits, and the profit factor. Finally, both systems perform better for long trades than for short trades.	algorithmic;artificial intelligence;cryptocurrencies;intraday trading
278	核心技术	CCUBI: A cross-chain based premium competition scheme with privacy preservation for usage-based insurance	Usage-based insurance (UBI) provides reasonable vehicle insurance premiums based on vehicle usage and driving behavior. In general, there are three major issues in realizing intelligent UBI systems. First, UBI evaluation mechanisms are not auditable to drivers. Insurers may thus deliberately adjust the UBI premiums. Second, the process of collecting driving data by insurers may lead to serious privacy breaches. Third, forging safer driving data for reducing insurance premiums may cause economic losses for insurers. To address these challenges, in this study, we propose CCUBI, a cross-chain-based premium competition scheme with privacy preservation for intelligent UBI systems. We introduce tamper-resistant blockchain and smart contracts to construct credible insurance mechanisms. The cross-chain technology connects these blockchains in the entire network to form an open premium competition scheme. Vehicle owners can assess designated insurers by sharing historical data with them to get a suitable CCUBI plan. In addition, we propose a data aggregation method used for CCUBI analysis with privacy preservation. Vehicle owners only publish proofs of the driving data. Proofs can still maintain privacy and computability in cross-chain flows. Finally, we adopt roadside units to detect forged driving data. We conduct a detailed security analysis. Experimental results also demonstrate the efficiency of CCUBI.	blockchain;cross-chain;data aggregation;privacy preservation;usage-based insurance
279	虚拟经济	Circular economy performance measurements and blockchain technology: an examination of relationships	Purpose This study proposes a systematic and comprehensive circular economy (CE) performance measure as an instrument to operationalize and quantify circularity. It seeks to evaluate the relative contribution of blockchain technology to evaluate various measures in this study. A general research agenda for investigating blockchain capabilities to performance assessment in CE is presented. Design/methodology/approach Empirical survey data from 32 CE and blockchain experts are collected to inform this study. Inductive reasoning, heatmaps, and a middle-range theory building approach are utilized to generalize theoretical patterns for blockchain support of CE performance assessment and measurement. A series of propositions are then developed as a middle-range theory for the true, false, perceptible, and hidden affordances of blockchain technology capabilities for CE performance measurement. Findings Overall, sixteen performance measures and metrics are identified and examined. The authors find most of these measures and metrics - based on literature and expert opinion - can be supported using blockchain technology capabilities. Four major blockchain capabilities, transparency and traceability, reliability and security, smart contracts, and incentivization and tokenization are shown to have varying potential support for CE performance assessment. There needs to be an evaluation of true, false, perceptible, and hidden affordances of blockchain technology capabilities for CE performance measurement in future studies. Originality/value Blockchain application for CE, and specifically performance measurements, is a new area. Research and practice evaluation on this issue is important but needs substantially additional investigation to help CE progress. This study provides a framework for evaluation and a foundation for future research at the nexus of CE, blockchain technology, and performance measurement.	circular economy;blockchain technology;performance measurement;sustainability;supply chainsupply chains;management;potentials;framework;lessons
280	实体经济	An Intelligent Automated System for Detecting Malicious Vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems	The exponential growth of intelligent vehicles(IVs) development has resulted in a complex network. As the number of IVs in a network increases, so does the number of connections. As a result, a great deal of data is generated. This complexity leads to insecure communication, traffic congestion, security, and privacy issues in vehicular networks (VNs). In addition, detecting malicious IVs, data integration, and data validation are major issues in VNs that affect network performance. A blockchain-based model for secure communication and malicious IV detection is proposed to address the above issues. In addition, this system also addresses data integration and transaction validation using an encryption scheme for secure communication. A multi-chain concept separates the legitimate and malicious data into two chains: the Integrity chain (I-chain) and Fraud chain (F-chain). This multi-chain mechanism solves the storage problem and reduces the computing power. The integration of blockchain in the proposed model provides privacy, network security, transparency, and immutability. To address the storage issue, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is integrated with Certificate Authority (CA). A reputation mechanism is introduced to detect malicious IVs in the network based on ratings. This reputation mechanism is also used to prevent Sybil attack. The evaluation of the proposed work is based on the cost of smart contracts and computation time. Furthermore, two attacker models are presented to prevent the selfish mining attack and the Sybil attack. Finally, a security analysis of the proposed smart contracts with their security vulnerabilities is also presented.	certificate authority;intelligent vehicles;interplanetary file system;vehicular networkelectric vehicle;blockchain;internet;secure;mechanism;model
281	核心技术	Decentralized identifier based illegal digital content distribution tracking system using the format-preserving encryption algorithm	The coronavirus pandemic, which first began in December 2019, has completely changed our daily lives. In particular, daily online digital content consumption over the world has soared since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. For preventing illegal digital content distribution, various technologies have been applied, but current copyright protection technologies are still lacking to provide secure digital content distribution while preserving privacy. In this article, we introduce a new digital content distribution system, which utilizes blockchain-based decentralized identifier and format-preserving encryption to enable user privacy preserved digital content tracking. We present the system architecture with detailed message flows of the proposal and provide its analysis result in terms of security and overhead.	decentralized identity;forensic watermarking;format-preserving encryption;illegal digital content distribution tracking system
282	核心技术	A Blockchain-Enabled Incentive Trust Management with Threshold Ring Signature Scheme for Traffic Event Validation in VANETs	As a part of the intelligent transportation system, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) provide timely information about road events and traffic to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, VANETs face many challenges, such as attacks from malicious vehicles, identity privacy leakage, and the absence of trust between vehicular nodes. In addition, vehicles nearby an event usually lack the motivation to participate in the traffic event validation whenever it occurs, which requires the cooperation of vehicles on the network. To solve these problems, a blockchain-enabled incentive trust model with a privacy-preserving threshold ring signature scheme for VANETs is proposed. Firstly, a threshold ring signature scheme is designed in order to allow participants in the non-trusted environment to anonymously witness the message's authenticity and reliability while guaranteeing the vehicle's privacy. Second, a blockchain-enabled incentive trust management model is presented to enable the roadside units (RSUs) to thwart various attacks and guarantee the trustworthiness of event messages transmitted in VANETs and also motivate the senders of the traffic information and their witnesses with incentives. Finally, to improve efficiency, a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus mechanism is used. Our proposed system is demonstrated to be effective and secure for VANETs, according to both security analysis and performance evaluation.	vehicular ad hoc networks;trust;privacy;security;event validation;incentives;blockchain;ring signatureauthentication scheme;safety;cloud;model
283	核心技术	XAuth: Efficient Privacy-Preserving Cross-Domain Authentication	It is well known that each Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system forms a closed security domain and only recognizes certificates in its own domain (such as medical systems, financial systems, and 5G networks). When users need to access services in other domains, their identities often cannot be recognized or PKI systems require extremely complex operations to authenticate the users' identities. This is the cross-domain authentication problem. The distributed consensus feature of blockchain provides a technical approach to solve this problem. However, there are some unresolved problems in existing blockchain-based schemes. On one hand, due to the low throughput of blockchain systems, the response speed may be insufferable when the number of cross-domain authentication requirements becomes enormous. On the other hand, these schemes insufficiently consider the privacy risk in the cross-domain scenario. In this article, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving cross-domain authentication scheme called XAuth that is integrated naturally with the existing PKI and Certificate Transparency (CT) systems. Specifically, we design a lightweight correctness verification protocol based on Multiple Merkle Hash Tree for rapid response. To protect users' privacy, we present an anonymous authentication protocol for cross-domain authentication. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that XAuth is secure and efficient.	authentication;security;blockchain;privacy;public key;protocols;computer architecture;cross-domain authentication;public key infrastructure;blockchain;privacy-preserving
284	市场治理	Blockchain adoption: value creation or insider selling?	Using a sample of listed firms in China, we aim to examine the motivation of blockchain adoption and propose two opposite hypotheses, namely value creation hypothesis and insider selling hypothesis. The empirical results demonstrate that initial blockchain adoption announcement leads to approximately 2% CAAR over the three-day interval around the release, whereas the abnormal return quickly reverses after the announcement, implying that the blockchain adoption can only provide short-term value and against the value creation hypothesis. The finding remains robust for largest industries (manufacturing and information technology) and release channels. On the contrary, we observe a significant positive effect of insider selling on the blockchain adoption announcement, which supports the insider selling hypothesis. Our findings can provide a better understanding on firms' motivation of blockchain adoption, warn the investors to keep a rational attitude to 'blockchain hysteria' when making investment decisions, and motivate the regulators to propose strict information disclosure mechanism and prevent insider selling behaviours.	blockchain;value creation;insider selling;event study;two-stage least square regression
285	核心技术	Making Byzantine consensus live	Partially synchronous Byzantine consensus protocols typically structure their execution into a sequence of views, each with a designated leader process. The key to guaranteeing liveness in these protocols is to ensure that all correct processes eventually overlap in a view with a correct leader for long enough to reach a decision. We propose a simple view synchronizer abstraction that encapsulates the corresponding functionality for Byzantine consensus protocols, thus simplifying their design. We present a formal specification of a view synchronizer and its implementation under partial synchrony, which runs in bounded space despite tolerating message loss during asynchronous periods. We show that our synchronizer specification is strong enough to guarantee liveness for single-shot versions of several well-known Byzantine consensus protocols, including PBFT and HotStuff. We furthermore give precise latency bounds for these protocols when using our synchronizer. By factoring out the functionality of view synchronization we are able to specify and analyze the protocols in a uniform framework, which allows comparing them and highlights trade-offs.	byzantine consensus;blockchain;partial synchrony;livenessunreliable failure detectors
286	核心技术	Research on Convergence Media Consensus Mechanism Based on Blockchain	In recent years, the media industry has achieved rapid development and experienced three development stages from traditional media to new media and then to the current convergence media. Convergence media has brought about great changes in content production, communication mechanism, operation and maintenance management, but also brought about problems such as declining credibility of the industry, difficulty in confirming content rights, difficulty in protecting user privacy, etc. Research on convergence media based on blockchain can make use of the characteristics of blockchain to design or optimize the media industry. In this paper, we introduced the development of convergence media, blockchain and consensus mechanism, then we described a sustainable convergence media ecology based on blockchain. Furthermore, we designed and implemented a consensus mechanism named proof of efficiency (PoE). After analysis, PoE can provide high security and resist 51% resource attack, sybil attack, etc. The experimental results show that PoE has the characteristics of decentralization, strong consistency, low energy consumption, short average block generation time, high throughput and short block confirmation time; the consensus results of PoE can reflect the node's ecological characteristics in convergence media which can stimulate the activity of nodes and better solve the generation of the Matthew effect.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;convergence media;media ecology;half-life;pagerankdistributed ledger technologies;fake news;secure;model
287	实体经济	Optimal joint decision of information disclosure and ordering in a blockchain-enabled luxury supply chain	This paper explores the optimal joint decision of product information disclosure and ordering in a blockchain-enabled luxury supply chain. Using analytical models, we investigate the optimal joint decision of information disclosure and ordering under three scenarios (i.e., wholesale contracts only, revenue-sharing (RS) contracts only, and a hybrid of these two types of contracts). Furthermore, we extend our study to examine the impacts of the number of competing retailers and the retailers' fairness concerns on supply chain members' optimal decisions. Lastly, the theoretical results are checked and illustrated by numerical examples with sensitivity analysis. The main findings are as follows: (1) As the proportion of information-sensitive consumers in the market increases, the level of product information disclosure of supply chain members increases in varying degrees, while supply chain members' order quantities and profits first decrease and then increase in varying degrees. (2) When a RS contract is acceptable for all supply chain members, all members benefit from the cooperation between the manufacturer and retailers. (3) Although all supply chain members may benefit from an increase in the number of retailers, when the number of retailers is greater than a certain threshold, retailers would be caught in a "prisoner's dilemma" of product information disclosure due to consumer information overload. Moreover, to maximize business profits, manufacturers should sometimes strictly limit and control the number of their reseller partners, rather than blindly expand their markets. (4) Retailers may benefit from their own fairness concerns if and only if the level of fairness concerns is sufficiently low, otherwise such concerns would be harmful to all supply chain members.	blockchain technology;information disclosure;wholesale and revenue-sharing contracts;luxury supply chain;newsvendor modelnewsvendor model;coordination;fairness;operations;contracts
288	实体经济	Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain platform for Indian Dairy Industry: Safety and Traceability	Conventional food supply chains are centralized in nature and possess challenges pertaining to a single point of failure, product irregularities, quality compromises, and loss of data. Numerous cases of food fraud, contamination, and adulteration are daily reported from multiple parts of India, suggesting the absolute need for an upgraded decentralized supply chain model. A country such as India, where its biggest strength is its demographic dividend, cannot afford to malnutrition a large population of its children by allowing them to consume contaminated and adulterated dairy products. In view of the gravity of the situation, we propose a blockchain-enabled supply chain platform for the dairy industry. With respect to the supply chain platform, the dairy products of choice include milk, cheese, and butter. Blockchain is one of the fastest growing technologies having widespread acceptance across multiple industry verticals. Blockchain possesses the power to transform traditional supply chains into decentralized, robust, transparent, tamper proof, and sustainable supply chains. The proposed supply chain platform goes beyond the aspect of food traceability and focuses on maintaining the nutritional values of dairy products, identification of adulteration and contamination in dairy products, the increasing economic viability of running a dairy farm, preventing counterfeit dairy products, and enhancing the revenue of the dairy company. The paper collates the mentioned functionalities into four distinct impact dimensions: social, economic, operations, and sustainability. The proposed blockchain-enabled dairy supply chain platform combines the use of smart contracts, quick response code (QR code) technology, and IoT and has the potential to redefine the dairy supply chains on socio-economic, operational, and sustainability parameters.	dairy products;food safety;traceability;supply chain management;blockchainfood;adulteration
289	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Cloud Manufacturing SCM System for Collaborative Enterprise Manufacturing: A Case Study of Transport Manufacturing	Sheet metal part manufacture is a precursor to various upstream assembly processes, including the manufacturing of mechanical and body parts of railcars, automobiles, ships, etc., in the transport manufacturing sector. The (re)manufacturing of railcars comprises a multi-tier manufacturing supply chain, mainly supported by local small and medium enterprises (SMEs), where siloed information leads to information disintegration between supplier and manufacturer. Technology spillovers in information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) are disrupting traditional supply chains, leading to a sustainable digital economy, driven by new innovations and business models in manufacturing. This paper presents application of industrial DevOps by merging industry 4.0 technologies for collaborative and sustainable supply chains. A blockchain-based information system (IS) and a cloud manufacturing (CM) process system were integrated, for a supply chain management (SCM) system for the railcar manufacturer. A systems thinking methodology was used to identify the multi-hierarchical system, and a domain-driven design approach (DDD) was applied to develop the event-driven microservice architecture (MSA). The result is a blockchain-based cloud manufacturing as a service (BCMaaS) SCM system for outsourcing part production for boxed sheet metal parts. In conclusion, the BCMaaS system performs part provenance, traceability, and analytics in real time for improved quality control, inventory management, and audit reliability.	scm;cloud manufacturing;industry 4.0;event-driven microservices;permissioned blockchain;kubernetes;statefulindustry 4.0;serverless;design
290	实体经济	Leveraging Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain Sustainability: A Provenance Perspective	Technological advancements in the past few decades have played a critical role in enhancing supply chain management from varied dimensions. While advancements in information technology have significantly improved various facets of the supply chain, supply chain visibility still lags in tracking and tracing capabilities. The disruptive and emergent blockchain technology (BCT) presents enormous potential to address issues of supply chain sustainability. This paper seeks to evaluate the proximity of BCT to resolve provenance issues throughout the supply chain. The research considers the immaturity of BCT alongside limited success stories in supply chain management. It uses a content analysis methodology to examine recent literature about using BCT in supply chain sustainability and provenance. A conceptual model for using BCT to create an enabled, visible, and sustainable supply chain is provided to frame the investigation. Findings reveal that the benefits of BCT have mostly been conceptually demonstrated in the sustainable supply chain literature, but with few practical applications. Moreover, technically driven challenges including scalability and control are still prevalent. It reaffirms the fact that participants within a blockchain enabled supply chain network must be at the same level of knowledge regarding the technology and its functionality. The study also indicates evidence of a growing research interest in the niche, which will eventually bring about solutions to address ongoing challenges faced by BCT in its integration into supply chain management. These findings contribute to the literature about improving the security and utility of supply chain sustainability and provenance by using BCT.	sustainable supply chain;blockchain technology;visibility;traceability;provenancevisibility;trust

292	核心技术	A Blockchain Storage Architecture Based on Information-Centric Networking	Blockchain technology is a unique distributed ledger technology that has been widely used in various areas. With the increase in data on the blockchain and the append-only nature of the blockchain, the traditional blockchain's full replica storage technique leads to blockchain storage scalability problem. Existing methods prioritize minimizing the storage strain on blockchain nodes while ignoring the availability of data, resulting in a lengthy average response time for users to access the blockchain. To address the shortcomings, this paper proposes an Information-Centric Networking-based blockchain storage architecture. The architecture uses the enhanced resolution system for community division to build blockchain node partitions and store blockchain ledgers in the underlying network. It introduces virtual chain for rapid blockchain indexing and adopts a collaborative block replica deletion algorithm across neighboring partitions, including replica number decision based on blockchain access decay characteristics and replica deletion based on resource relationship. Finally, we compare and analyze the proposed blockchain storage architecture with BC-store and KASARASA, and the results demonstrate that this architecture has significantly lower average access time than others. The replica data volume of this method is reduced by 57.2% compared to the full replica policy, but the access time is only 5.2% slower when compared to the full replica policy, which substantially increases the replica storage utilization.	blockchain storage;informationcentric networking;replica delete;decaymanagement

An ICO can result in a better or worse alignment of the interests of the entrepreneur and the investors compared with debt and venture capital financing. Notably, an ICO can be the only form of financing that induces optimal effort, and there are projects that should not take place unless they can be financed through an ICO.

However, due to limited computing power and bandwidth resources, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks can cause more severe damage to SI, and even paralysis of the entire network. Current DDoS defense mechanisms are built on abundant computing power and bandwidth resources, making applying in the SI scenario challenging. Aiming at protecting SI from DDoS attacks, a blockchain-based distributed collaborative entrance defense (DCED) framework is proposed, in which network traffic characteristics can be recorded and aggregated at the entrances of SI. The proposed framework consists of a distributed detection digesting procedure, a digest virtual aggregation procedure, and an entrance control strategy. The former procedure detects and extracts multidimensional characteristics of DDoS attacks and pushes them onto the blockchain. The latter procedure collects block data and aggregates attack features using the MapReduce algorithm and then compares them with baseline and gives an alert. The strategy completes the filtering and interception of traffic. Experiments use the IXIA platform to generate malicious traffic, and results show that the framework can accurately identify attack traffic within 1500 ms, reaching an area of 0.99 under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The proposed framework is more effective than other similar DDoS methods, protecting the precious SI bandwidth resources.	denial-of-service attack;computer crime;internet;satellites;feature extraction;blockchains;servers;blockchain;distributed denial-of-service (ddos) detection;mapreduce;satellite internet (si)networks;mechanisms
295	实体经济	A survey on blockchain, SDN and NFV for the smart-home security	Due to millions of loosely coupled devices, the smart-home security is gaining the attention of industry professionals, attackers, and academic researchers. The smart home is a typical home where many sensors, actuators, and IoT devices are used to automate home users' daily activities. Although a smart home provides comfort, safety, and satisfaction to users, it opens up multiple challenging security issues when automating and offering intelligent services. Recent studies have investigated not only blockchain but SDN and NFV to address these challenges. We present a comprehensive survey on blockchain, SDN, and NFV for smart-home security. The paper also proposes a new architecture of the smart-home security. First, we describe the features of the smart home and its current security issues. Next, we outline the characteristics of blockchain, SDN, and NFV, including their contribution to improving the smart-home security. While SDN enhances the management and access control of the home network by providing a programmable controller to home nodes, NFV implements the functions of network appliances (e.g., network monitoring, firewall) as virtual machines and ensures the high availability of the network. Blockchain reinforces IoT data's privacy, integrity, and security and improves the trust in transactions among untrusted IoT devices. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in the field and propose recommendations towards high-level security for the smart home.	smart homes;iot;privacy;security;trust;blockchain;sdn;nfvddos attack detection;network architecture;iot;internet;things;infrastructure;authentication;simulation;challenges;management
296	协同技术	A Survey on Integrity Auditing for Data Storage in the Cloud: From Single Copy to Multiple Replicas	The rapid advancement of cloud computing has promoted the development of cloud storage services. One of the biggest concerns of cloud users is whether the completeness and recoverability of data can be guaranteed when cloud servers encounter problems. Only when the integrity of data is fully guaranteed can users consume cloud storage with confidence, especially in a complicated cloud environment with multiple clouds. However, the literature still lacks a thorough survey on cloud data integrity auditing for both single copy and multiple replicas. In this article, we survey and compare existing auditing schemes for single copy and multiple replicas based on a set of criteria. Based on our review and analysis, we discuss open issues, potential applications and future directions in the field of the integrity auditing in the cloud, including the implications of such trendy topics as merging blockchain and edge computing into data integrity auditing.	cloud computing;computational modeling;data integrity;servers;memory;gold;integrity auditing;data storage;cloud computing;singly copy;multiple replicasprovable data possession;checking;retrievability;proof
297	技术治理	Cryptocurrency Mining Malware Detection Based on Behavior Pattern and Graph Neural Network	Miner malware has been steadily increasing in recent years as the value of cryptocurrency rises, which poses a considerable threat to users' device security. Miner malware has obvious behavior patterns in order to participate in blockchain computing. However, most miner malware detection methods use raw bytes feature and sequential opcode as detection features. It is difficult for these methods to obtain better detection results due to not modeling robust features. In this paper, a miner malware identification method based on graph classification network is designed by analyzing the features of function call graph and control flow graph of miner malware, called MBGINet. MBGINet can model the behavior graph relationship of miner malware by extracting the connection features of critical nodes in the behavior graph. Finally, MBGINet transforms these node features into the feature vectors of the graph for miner malware identification. In the test experiments, datasets with different volumes are used for simulating real-world scenarios. The experimental results show that the MBGINet method achieves a leading and stable performance compared to the dedicated opcode detection method and obtains an accuracy improvement of 3.08% on the simulated in-the-wild dataset. Meanwhile, MBGINet gains an advantage over the general malware detection method Malconv. These experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the MBGINet method, which has excellent characteristics in adapting to realistic scenarios.	
298	实体经济	On the Design of Secured and Reliable Dynamic Access Control Scheme of Patient E-Healthcare Records in Cloud Environment	Traditional healthcare services have changed into modern ones in which doctors can diagnose patients from a distance. All stakeholders, including patients, ward boy, life insurance agents, physicians, and others, have easy access to patients' medical records due to cloud computing. The cloud's services are very cost-effective and scalable, and provide various mobile access options for a patient's electronic health records (EHRs). EHR privacy and security are critical concerns despite the many benefits of the cloud. Patient health information is extremely sensitive and important, and sending it over an unencrypted wireless media raises a number of security hazards. This study suggests an innovative and secure access system for cloud-based electronic healthcare services storing patient health records in a third-party cloud service provider. The research considers the remote healthcare requirements for maintaining patient information integrity, confidentiality, and security. There will be fewer attacks on e-healthcare records now that stakeholders will have a safe interface and data on the cloud will not be accessible to them. End-to-end encryption is ensured by using multiple keys generated by the key conclusion function (KCF), and access to cloud services is granted based on a person's identity and the relationship between the parties involved, which protects their personal information that is the methodology used in the proposed scheme. The proposed scheme is best suited for cloud-based e-healthcare services because of its simplicity and robustness. Using different Amazon EC2 hosting options, we examine how well our cloud-based web application service works when the number of requests linearly increases. The performance of our web application service that runs in the cloud is based on how many requests it can handle per second while keeping its response time constant. The proposed secure access scheme for cloud-based web applications was compared to the Ethereum blockchain platform, which uses internet of things (IoT) devices in terms of execution time, throughput, and latency.	privacy issues;big data;storage;devices;system;robust;model
299	实体经济	Privacy Preserving Biometric Authentication on the blockchain for smart healthcare	Privacy Preserving Biometric Authentication (PPBA) schemes are designed for anonymous authentication of patients to protect patient's privacy in accessing healthcare services. Recently, blockchain technology in healthcare has emerged as a new research area to provide tamper-resistance and non-repudiation in e-health systems. One aspect of this research could lead to blockchain-based secure biometric identification for smart healthcare, which may face the paradox of anonymous biometric authentication on public blockchains. In this paper, we describe an efficient, fully anonymous and GDPR-compliant PPBA protocol built into the blockchain of any privacy coin such as Monero. The new protocol provides encrypted offline storage and processing in the encrypted domain. The infrastructure necessary for the online authentication is outsourced to the public blockchain that provides integrity of its data. In addition to auditing capabilities for misbehaving entities, the new system reduces the number of transactions necessary for authentication and enables revocation of biometric identities. We provide new PPBA schemes both for set difference/overlap and Euclidean distance metrics without using bilinear pairings, where the former leads to an efficient solution to the compatibility for organ transplant. We limit the generation of encrypted templates for public testing even if biometric/health data is of low min-entropy. Due to the anonymity of the cryptocurrency, we break the link between the stealth address of an authenticating user and its biometrics. We describe the user and identity privacy notions independent of the underlying privacy coin and guarantee the security of our proposal in the framework of those generic notions. Finally, we simulate the new proposal on Monero blockchain and analyze the transaction fees required for hill climbing attacks. The results show that our design leads to a natural hindrance against these attacks that could be successful even if the templates are stored as encrypted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient blockchain-based PPBA scheme that exhibits a punishment against hill climbing attacks through transaction fees. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

300	实体经济	DAAC: Digital Asset Access Control in a Unified Blockchain Based E-Health System	The use of the Internet of Things and modern technologies has boosted the expansion of e-health solutions significantly and allowed access to better health services and remote monitoring of patients. Every service provider usually implements its information system to manage and access patient data for its unique purpose. Hence, the interoperability among independent e-health service providers is still a major challenge. From the structure of stored data to its large volume, the design of each such big data system varies, hence the cooperation among different e-health systems is almost impossible. In addition to this, the security and privacy of patient information is a challenging task. Building a unified solution for all creates significant business and economic issues. In this article, we present a solution to migrate existing e-health systems to a unified Blockchain-based model, where access to large scale medical data of patients can be achieved seamlessly by any service provider. A core blockchain network connects individual & independent e-health systems without requiring them to modify their internal processes. Access to patient data in the form of digital assets stored in off-chain storage is controlled through patient-centric channels and policy transactions. Through emulation, we show that the proposed solution can interconnect different e-health systems efficiently.	access control;blockchain;medical services;big data;interoperability;servers;medical diagnostic imaging;blockchain;e-health systems;digital assets;access control;electronic medical records (emr);interoperabilityauthentication scheme;privacy protection;management;internet
301	实体经济	Blockchain-Assisted Adaptive Reconfiguration Method for Trusted UAV Network	Due to the high mobility of nodes and the complexity of the mission environment, mission-oriented UAV networks are not only subject to frequent topology changes, but also to the risk of being compromised, hijacked and corrupted. As a result, an operating UAV network is essentially a Byzantine distributed system whose physical structure and node trustworthiness change over time. How to implement the global management of UAV networks to achieve a rational allocation of UAV network resources and reconfiguration of trusted networks is a problem worthy of in-depth study. The method proposed in this paper introduces a lightweight storage blockchain in the UAV network through two-stage consensus, firstly performing data consensus on the local state records of the nodes, then performing decision consensus on the data consensus results using algorithms such as fuzzy K-Modes clustering and global trustworthiness assessment, and finally recording the decision consensus results into a new block as the new configuration information of the UAV network. A lightweight storage blockchain-assisted trusted zone routing protocol (BC_TZRP) is designed to dynamically and adaptively build configurable trusted networks in a way that the blockchain continuously adds new blocks. Using QualNet simulation experimental software, an experimental comparison between the classical routing protocol for mobile self-organizing networks and the traditional consensus algorithm for blockchains is conducted. The results show that the approach has significant advantages in terms of packet delivery rate, routing overhead and average end-to-end delay, and can effectively improve the overall working life and fault tolerance of the UAV network.	mission-oriented uav network;lightweight storage blockchain;reconfiguring trusted networks;fuzzy k-modes clusteringrouting protocol;hoc;lanmar
302	核心技术	SIGNORA: A Blockchain-Based Framework for Dataflow Integrity Provisioning in an Untrusted Data Pipeline	In a typical data pipeline, the dataflow starts from the first node, where the data is initiated, and moves to the last node in the pipeline, where the processed data will be stored. Due to the sheer number of involved participants, it is crucial to protect the dataflow integrity in the pipeline. While previous studies have outlined solutions to this matter, the solution for an untrusted data pipeline is still left unexplored, which motivates us to propose SIGNORA. Our proposal combines the concept of a chain of signatures with blockchain receipt to provide dataflow integrity. The chain of signatures provides a non-repudiation guarantee from participants, while the hash of the data and signatures is anchored in the blockchain for a non-tampering guarantee through blockchain receipt. Aside from that, SIGNORA also satisfies essential requirements of running data pipeline processing in an open and untrusted environment, such as (i) providing reliable identity management, (ii) solving the trust and accountability issues through a reputation system, (iii) supporting various devices through multiple cryptographic algorithms (i.e., ECDSA, EdDSA, RSA, and HMAC), and (iv) off-chain processing. Our experiment results show that SIGNORA can provide dataflow integrity provisioning in multiple scenarios of data payload size with reasonable overhead. Furthermore, the cost of smart contract methods has also been analyzed, and several off-chain solutions have been addressed to reduce transaction costs. Finally, the reputation system can adapt to the history of nodes' activities by increasing their scores when they actively perform honest behavior while reducing their scores when they become inactive. Therefore, SIGNORA can provide a high degree of accountability for participants collaborating in an untrusted environment.	blockchains;data processing;cloud computing;pipeline processing;receivers;behavioral sciences;smart contracts;data flow computing;dataflow integrity;blockchain;chain of signatures;blockchain receipt;data pipeline
303	实体经济	A Practical Anonymous Voting Scheme Based on Blockchain for Internet of Energy	E-voting allows us to build a democratic business in most Internet of things (IoT) systems. For example, we may vote to choose a proper energy broker in a smart grid system. In this study, we focus on e-voting services in an Internet of energy (IoE) system, which is a new-style smart grid. A practical e-voting in IoE may focus on the properties of fairness, decentralization, eligibility, anonymity, compatibility, verifiability, and coercion resistance. It is difficult to fulfil all these properties simultaneously. Traditional voting schemes often use a public bulletin board or administrator in the voting process, which makes them become centralized. Services that offer e-voting via blockchain can make the voting schemes decentralized. However, many of them ignore the complexity of organizing the data of the transactions, which should be confirmed by the miners. Moreover, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no works have tested the performance in the blockchain while considering practical use cases and constraints. Concerning all the challenges, we propose a practical anonymous voting scheme for IoE called IoEPAV. The proposed scheme fulfils all the mentioned design goals simultaneously. We tested IoEPAV both in different test networks of the Ethereum blockchain to give an overall evaluation. The practical evaluation can show that the proposed scheme is easy to be integrated into a real system like IoE. We also gave a comparison analysis with the state-of-the-art blockchain-based e-voting. All the results show that IoEPAV is decentralized, verifiable, anonymous, and highly efficient.	things
304	实体经济	A cross-chain enabled day-ahead collaborative power-carbon-TGC market	The contradiction between the independent operation and inner connection of the power market, carbon market and TGC market have become the primary challenge towards developing renewable energy and low-carbon technologies. This paper proposes a day-ahead collaborative power-carbon-TCG market framework and its implementation methodology based on the cross-chain technology to cope with the challenge. The daily collaborative market is designed to operate sequentially to reflect the time attribute of carbon emission and TGC production. Penalty factors are introduced in the power market to indicate the inter-market influences from the carbon and TGC markets. Furthermore, cross-chain technologies are leveraged to form a unified framework for the coordination of the three markets, and the chain structures of each market are redesigned to fit into the unified framework. The conclusion is drawn from the case studies on the modified IEEE-30 bus system. The results indicate that the total carbon emission of the system is reduced under the collaborative market framework. The market shares and profits of low-emission and renewable units increase vastly, benefiting low-carbon and renewable energy companies in the long term.	market mechanism;carbon market;tradable green certificate;cross -chain technology;blockchainelectricity;operation;energy;generation;blockchain;wind
305	核心技术	Secure Deterministic Wallet and Stealth Address: Key-Insulated and Privacy-Preserving Signature Scheme With Publicly Derived Public Key	Deterministic Wallet (DW) and Stealth Address (SA) mechanisms have been widely adopted in the cryptocurrency community, due to their virtues on functionality and privacy protection, which come from a key derivation mechanism that allows an arbitrary number of derived keys to be generated from a master key. However, these algorithms suffer a vulnerability that, when one derived key is compromised somehow, the damage is not limited to the leaked derived key only, but to the master key and in consequence all derived keys are compromised. In this article, we introduce and formalize a new signature variant, called Key-Insulated and Privacy-Preserving Signature Scheme with Publicly Derived Public Key (PDPKS), which fully captures and improves the functionality, security, and privacy requirements of DW and SA. We propose a PDPKS construction and prove its security and privacy in the random oracle model. Furthermore, we implement the construction with parameters for 128-bit security, and the results show that it is practically efficient for the setting of cryptocurrencies. With its solid guarantee on functionality, security and privacy, as well as its practical efficiency, our PDPKS construction provides a practical cryptographic tool that refines DW and SA, without security vulnerability.	public key;privacy;companies;bitcoin;digital signatures;approximation algorithms;solids;signature scheme;publicly derived public key;key-insulated security;privacy;cryptocurrency;stealth addresses;deterministic walletsidentity-based encryption;efficient
306	协同技术	Golden Grain: Building a Secure and Decentralized Model Marketplace for MLaaS	ML-as-a-service (MLaaS) becomes increasingly popular and revolutionizes the lives of people. A natural requirement for MLaaS is, however, to provide highly accurate prediction services. To achieve this, current MLaaS systems integrate and combine multiple well-trained models in their services. Yet, in reality, there is no easy way for MLaaS providers, especially for startups, to collect sufficiently well-trained models from individual developers, due to the lack of incentives. In this article, we aim to fill this gap by building up a model marketplace, called as Golden Grain, to facilitate model sharing, which enforces the fair model-money swapping process between individual developers and MLaaS providers. Specifically, we deploy the swapping process on the blockchain, and further introduce a blockchain-empowered model benchmarking process for transparently determining the model prices according to their authentic performances, so as to motivate the faithful contributions of well-trained models. Especially, to ease the blockchain overhead for model benchmarking, our marketplace carefully offloads the heavy computation and designs a secure off-chain on-chain interaction protocol based on a trusted execution environment (TEE), for ensuring both the integrity and authenticity of benchmarking. We implement a prototype of our Golden Grain on the Ethereum blockchain, and conduct extensive experiments using standard benchmark datasets to demonstrate the practically affordable performance of our design.	benchmark testing;blockchain;computational modeling;data models;smart contracts;predictive models;urban areas;ml-as-a-service;blockchain;marketplace;trusted execution environmentattacks
307	核心技术	Fast distributed consensus seeking in large-scale and high-density multi-agent systems with connectivity maintenance	With the rapid development of wireless communication and localization technologies, multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful distributed artificial intelligence for consensus control. However, the connectivity of an MAS with a limited sensing range is vulnerable to the evolution of agents with high mobility, so converging to one common equilibrium rapidly while maintaining connectivity under a large-scale and high-density topology has been a research challenge. To address this problem, we develop a heuristic combinatorial algorithm that combines a distributed sector-division-based (SDB) consensus algorithm and a d-subgraph (DSG) connectivity maintenance algorithm. First, the communication region is heuristically divided into multiple sectors, and agents select representative neighbors to calculate control inputs by simultaneously considering the number and the distribution of perceived neighbors. Second, the d-subgraph is designed to update agents in accordance with constraint set constructed from the nearest neighbors in their locally perceived connected components. Thus, sequentially combining the SDB and the DSG algorithms affords a heuristic combinatorial (SDB&DSG) algorithm that can effectively accelerate convergence to a common equilibrium and retain global connectivity. The theoretical proofs of connectivity and convergence are given geometrically. Extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm, especially in large-scale and high-density topologies. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

308	核心技术	Neural Fairness Blockchain Protocol Using an Elliptic Curves Lottery	To protect participants' confidentiality, blockchains can be outfitted with anonymization methods. Observations of the underlying network traffic can identify the author of a transaction request, although these mechanisms often only consider the abstraction layer of blockchains. Previous systems either give topological confidentiality that may be compromised by an attacker in control of a large number of nodes, or provide strong cryptographic confidentiality but are so inefficient as to be practically unusable. In addition, there is no flexible mechanism to swap confidentiality for efficiency in order to accommodate practical demands. We propose a novel approach, the neural fairness protocol, which is a blockchain-based distributed ledger secured using neural networks and machine learning algorithms, enabling permissionless participation in the process of transition validation while concurrently providing strong assurance about the correct functioning of the entire network. Using cryptography and a custom implementation of elliptic curves, the protocol is designed to ensure the confidentiality of each transaction phase and peer-to-peer data exchange.	blockchain;distributed consensus;neural networks;elliptic cryptographic curves;decentralized applications;tokens;machine learning;confidentiality preserving;cryptocurrenciesalgorithm
309	实体经济	Secured information sharing in supply chain management: Modified data sanitization with optimal key generation via hybrid algorithm	In the majority of commercial scenarios, supply chain management (SCM) is turning out to be a fundamental focus area. In SCM, a hopeful solution for secured information sharing (IS) is blockchain technology. Never-theless, it is a bit crucial to maintain security at all levels of blockchain, and therefore private and public-key cryptography is often favored. This study improves the security and privacy of a suggested "blockchain assis-ted supply chain management (SCM)," in which "Modified Data Sanitization and Data Restoration" is performed with an ideal key generation technique to retain sensitive data in each block. The major challenge that must be overcome to make data transmission security is optimal key selection. Significantly, the proposed hybridized algorithm is used to generate the optimal key in both processes. The proposed hybrid model is known as Whale Updated Butterfly Optimization (WU-BO) and is a conceptual mixture of "Butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)."Eventually, the examination is performed for verifying the enhancement of the developed model.	supply chain management;data sanitization;block chain;optimal key generation;wu-bomodelperformance;impact
310	核心技术	An Overview of Technologies for Improving Storage Efficiency in Blockchain-Based IIoT Applications	Since the inception of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, researchers have been fascinated with the idea of integrating blockchain technology into other fields, such as health and manufacturing. Despite the benefits of blockchain, which include immutability, transparency, and traceability, certain issues that limit its integration with IIoT still linger. One of these prominent problems is the storage inefficiency of the blockchain. Due to the append-only nature of the blockchain, the growth of the blockchain ledger inevitably leads to high storage requirements for blockchain peers. This poses a challenge for its integration with the IIoT, where high volumes of data are generated at a relatively faster rate than in applications such as financial systems. Therefore, there is a need for blockchain architectures that deal effectively with the rapid growth of the blockchain ledger. This paper discusses the problem of storage inefficiency in existing blockchain systems, how this affects their scalability, and the challenges that this poses to their integration with IIoT. This paper explores existing solutions for improving the storage efficiency of blockchain-IIoT systems, classifying these proposed solutions according to their approaches and providing insight into their effectiveness through a detailed comparative analysis and examination of their long-term sustainability. Potential directions for future research on the enhancement of storage efficiency in blockchain-IIoT systems are also discussed.	blockchain;iiot;scalability;storage efficiency;storage optimization;compression;summarization;machine learningiot;optimization;internet;things;architecture;challenges;management;systems;design;scheme
311	核心技术	A Parking Sharing Network Over Blockchain With Proof-of-Planned-Behavior Consensus Protocol	Parking problem has become a bottle neck of urban traffic management. On one hand, there is no effective way to get timely information of available parking lots. On the other hand, owners of private parking spaces are less willing to share their spare lots. To deal with the parking problem, a new parking sharing network named ParkChain is firstly proposed using blockchain to build a decentralized but trustworthy network. Herein, ParkChain provides a distributed autonomous infrastructure for both vehicle drivers and park granters, which can promote the extensive parking resource sharing and relieve the parking problem. A new blockchain consensus protocol named Proof-of-Planned-Behavior (PoPB) is proposed. It builds the model of the autonomous consensus process based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), derives a computable threshold for qualification of block data authorizers, and then develops a dynamic authorizer group mechanism for creditability and decentrality considerations. Furthermore, various smart contracts are developed to carry out the parking services transparently. Finally, the prototype has been successfully implemented in a university campus setting to demonstrate the effectiveness of ParkChain.	smart contracts;consensus protocol;resource management;peer-to-peer computing;computer architecture;industries;vehicle dynamics;blockchain;parking sharing network;popb consensus protocol;smart contractsecure;internet
312	实体经济	ReliefChain: A blockchain leveraged post disaster relief allocation system over smartphone-based DTN	One of the major concerns in any emergency relief operation is appropriate allocation of scarce emergency relief materials to the affected community. Due to several reasons ranging from lack of mechanism to accurately assess demand and utility of relief materials to malicious participation of some of the stakeholders, such allocation may become ad-hoc. Thus, it becomes imperative to have an unchallengeable and globally accessible record of relief requirement vis-a-vis allocation for efficient relief management. Emergency response organizations (e.g. UNICEF) have recommended the adoption of blockchain technology to create such immutable records. However, the usage of blockchain is restricted by the availability of end-to-end internet connection which may not be available in a post-disaster scenario. This paper proposes ReliefChain, a blockchain leveraged post disaster relief allocation system over delay tolerant network that works in such environments. We validate relief requirements to mitigate resource diversion, forecasting the exact demand and enumerating precise utilities of relief items. We design smart contracts for creating new transactions to upload relief requirements and allocations in the blockchain network. The proposed system executes these smart contracts to create an immutable and globally accessible record of relief requirement and allocation. Effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through extensive simulation in Ethereum platform. Results substantiate the efficiency of the system over a system using baseline methodologies, in terms of design parameters like shelter specific deficit and average resource deficit while not compromising the blockchain performance in terms of processing time and gas consumption even in presence of malicious forwarders.	blockchain;delay-tolerant network (dtn);ethereum;post disaster relief allocation;smart contracts
313	实体经济	Electronic Health Records Sharing Model Based on Blockchain With Checkable State PBFT Consensus Algorithm	With the popularity of IoT devices and cloud technology in the medical industry. Sharing EHRs (Electronic Health Records) among medical institutions improves the accuracy of medical diagnosis and promotes the development of public medical. However, it is difficult to share EHRs among hospitals, and patients typically don't know about the usage of their health records. In this paper, we propose a patient-controlled EHRs sharing scheme based on cloud computing collaborating blockchain technology. The medical abstract and the access strategy are stored in the blockchain to avoid being tampered with. To achieve the fine-grained access control, we propose the attribute-based encryption scheme and multi-keyword encryption scheme to encrypt EHRs. Moreover, we proposed a node-state-checkable Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm (sc-PBFT) to prevent the Byzantine nodes from sneaking into the consortium blockchain. First, we check the state of the elected master node to avoid the master node having any malicious records. Then, using pre-prepared, prepare, and commit processes to complete the consensus request submitted by the client. At last, the proposed consensus algorithm evaluates the state of the master node according to the completion of the three-stage process to reduce the impact of the malicious node on the whole consortium blockchain. By doing this, the malicious node will be marked and isolated into the isolation area. The experimental results show that the proposed sc-PBFT algorithm has better handling capability and lower consensus latency. Compared with the PBFT algorithm in the case of Byzantine nodes, sc-PBFT not only improves the robustness of the consortium blockchain network but also improves the handling capability.	medical services;cryptography;blockchains;medical diagnostic imaging;cloud computing;information sharing;encryption;data sharing;ehr;blockchain;byzantine node;pbft;consortium blockchainattribute-based signcryption;cloud;scheme;encryption;secure
314	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based and SGX-Enabled Access Control Framework for IoT	With the rapid development of physical networks, tens of billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices have been deployed worldwide. Access control is essential in the IoT system, which manages user access to vital IoT data. However, access control for the IoT is mainly based on centralized trusted servers, which face problems such as a single point of failure and data leakage. To tackle these challenges, we propose an access control framework for the IoT by combining blockchain and Intel software guard extension (SGX) technology. A blockchain validates both IoT devices and edge servers added to the network. The access control contract is deployed on the blockchain, which can manage attribute-based access control policies in a fine-grained manner and make access control decisions flexibly. SGX technology is introduced into the edge computing server to realize the confidentiality of data processing. Finally, we implemented the prototype of the framework on Quorum and conducted extensive experiments and theoretical analyses on the performance of the blockchain. The results of the experimental tests and theoretical analyses show that our framework has more advantages in computing costs and on-chain storage costs.	blockchain;software guard extensions (sgx);internet of things (iot);access control;smart contractinternet

Security protocols are required to increase the security of the system. Therefore, in this article, an enhanced Elman spike neural network (EESNN) with green proof of work consensus algorithm (GPoW) is proposed for enhancing the security of IoT network. Initially, the generalized security mechanism as EESNN approach is proposed for the IoT network by categorizing the devices into malicious and benign. Then, the GPoW consensus algorithm is used for enhancing the security of the devices from malicious attacks. Subsequently, a coalition formation (CF) algorithm is used for reducing the excess energy consumption in a network. The proposed EESNN-GPoW-CF approach has effectively classified the malicious attacks and enhances the security of the IoT network. The simulation of this work is done in Python. From the simulation, the proposed EESNN-GPoW-CF approach attains high efficiency outcomes in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, PDR, PLR, throughput, overhead, computation time, and delay. Moreover, the proposed EESNN-GPoW-CF approach attains 3.1%, 5.3%, 7.4% high accuracy rate, and 7.5%, 12.5%, 14.7% lower computation time with 4.8%, 2.3%, 5.7% lower energy utilization than the existing methods, such as deep learning based blockchain for IoT security, deep reinforcement learning based blockchain for IoT security, and deep blockchain-based trustworthy privacy preserving secured framework in IoT, respectively.	industrial internet
316	实体经济	BLOCKCHAIN-BASED LIGHTWEIGHT AUTHENTICATION FOR RESILIENT UAV COMMUNICATIONS: ARCHITECTURE, SCHEME, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS	Representing a new stage in the industrial value chain, Industry 4.0 paves the way to the future ecosystems of industrial innovation, where cyber-physical systems (e.g., smart machines) form its basis by bridging the physical and digital worlds. As one of the most popular groups in intelligent devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown great potential for facilitating various industrial sectors. With research on new applications flourishing, the accompanying communication security issue between UAVs is also of concern because of the vital role of communication in enabling the reliable performance of UAV networks. Authentication is recognized as the first defense line for guaranteeing communication security, but traditional authentication schemes are either highly dependent on the central authority or too costly for UAV networks, making them less feasible in practical applications. In this article, we propose a novel authentication scheme for UAV networks using blockchain technology, where blockchain edge nodes are introduced to maintain the ledger, while drones can just be clients to use the distributed blockchain services by calling smart contract APIs. Experimental results illustrate its efficiency, and future research directions are also summarized to guide explorations for realizing more general authentication systems for UAV-assisted industrial applications.	
317	实体经济	DELIA: Distributed Efficient Log Integrity Audit Based on Hierarchal Multi-Party State Channel	Audit log contains the trace of different activities in computing systems, which makes it critical for security management, censorship, and forensics. However, experienced attackers may delete or modify the audit log after their attacks, which makes the audit log unavailable in attack investigation. In this article, we focus on the log integrity audit in the same domain, in which a number of servers update audit logs for a single or several organizations as an alliance. We propose a distributed efficient log integrity audit framework, called DELIA, which employs the distributed ledger technique to protect audit information, and utilizes the idea of state channel to improve the throughput of distributed ledger. To generate stable state from the rapidly-updated logs in the domain, we propose a log state generation scheme, which not only generates state suitable for audit logs, but also enables mutual supervision within the domain. To overcome the high latency in existing state channel schemes, we propose a hierarchal multi-party state channel scheme, which makes the latency in our framework independent of the number of servers in the domain. We implement DELIA on Ethereum and evaluate its performance. The results show that our framework is efficient and secure in practice.	servers;distributed ledger;data structures;gold;forensics;organizations;intrusion detection;audit log;integrity;blockchain;state channel
318	市场治理	Multiscale complexity fluctuation behaviours of stochastic interacting cryptocurrency price model	The price dynamics of the emerging cryptocurrency market become an important factor affecting the current global investment market. To investigate its microscopic nonlinear dynamics mechanism, we develop a novel financial agent-based price model by combining the stochastic interacting system and two opposite directions of random jump processes, in which the attribute interactions between particles in the interacting system are utilized to imitate the influence of information transmission on investor's investment attitude in the cryptocurrency market. Return series of the model, generated by Monte Carlo simulations, can reproduce a number of "stylized facts" of real cryptocurrency data. Additionally, we apply the composite multiscale fuzzy entropy algorithm and the matching energy method to detecting the complexity of price volatility behaviours in both actual and simulated cryptocurrency markets. The similarity of empirical results indicates that the proposed model can replicate the properties of price volatility in actual cryptocurrency market to some extent. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

The equilibrium set is composed of a unique equilibrium where the value of money increases until it reaches a steady state and, if money has no intrinsic value, a continuum of perfect-foresight equilibria where the price of money inflates and bursts over time. Early on private money is held for a speculative motive and it acquires a transactional role when money supply becomes sufficiently abundant. We study different mining and matching technologies, fiat and commodity monies, single and Money competing currencies. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

320	技术治理	A General Quantitative Analysis Framework for Attacks in Blockchain	Decentralized cryptocurrency systems have become primary targets for attackers due to substantial profit gain and economic rewards. A number of attack models have been proposed during last few years. However, the evaluation and comparison of those attack models remain problematic due to the lack of systematic framework to analyze them. In this work, we propose a general quantitative analysis framework for attack models in the network and consensus layer of blockchain. We identify the problem statement and evolution process. And we show how to apply our general framework in previous attacks such as selfish mining and bribery attack. We also explained that the framework is suitable for other attacks in blockchain. For further exploration, we simulate the success rate and benefits of different attacks through experiments. We provide several defensive strategies, and study how these strategies against previous attack models.	blockchains;bitcoin;biological system modeling;statistical analysis;computational modeling;ieee transactions;analytical models;blockchain;quantified framework;selfish mining;bribery attack;mechanism design
321	实体经济	Cross-Domain Self-Authentication Based Consortium Blockchain for Autonomous Valet Parking System	This paper proposed a cross-domain self-authentication scheme to address the "information isolated island" problem of users' identities storage in servers and the "redundant registration problem" of users' identities for Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). This scheme adopts a decentralized anonymous authentication method to relieve the authentication center's service load. Users are segregated into two categories to increase authentication efficiency: inexperienced and regular users. For the former, the paper explores a self-authentication mechanism based on verification parameters. Then, its valid personal information, pseudonym and public key, were stored in a consortium blockchain (PseIDChain) as the transaction records so that they can be securely shared among servers located in different domains. For the latter (regular users), an efficient authentication mechanism, searching users' personal information on PseIDChain by the smart contract, was proposed. Security proof and simulation results show that the designed scheme has superior security to the existing schemes. Its authentication efficiency is 80.29% and 50.45% higher than the traditional anonymous and batch authentication schemes.	privacy;authentication;servers;security;navigation;real-time systems;autonomous systems;blockchains;autonomous valet parking;privacy protection;cross-domain authentication;consortium blockchain;pseudonym

For this purpose, we apply the Tate pairing on the curve; however, it is not required to be pairing-friendly. Whenever the cofactor is small, the new subgroup test is much more efficient than other known ones, because it needs to compute at most two n-th power residue symbols (with small n) in the basic field. More precisely, the running time of the test is (sub-)quadratic in the bit length of the field size, which is comparable with the Decaf-style technique. The test is relevant, e.g., for the zk-SNARK friendly curves Bandersnatch and Jubjub proposed by the Ethereum and Zcash research teams, respectively.	non-prime-order elliptic curves;power residue symbol;subgroup membership testing;tate pairing

Even though it looks challenging, such an issue can be controlled if we can reuse them. To handle this, in our work, we design a machine learning and blockchain-oriented system that identifies the waste objects/products and recommends to the user multiple 'Do-It-Yourself' (DIY) ideas to reuse or recycle. Blockchain records every transaction in the shared ledger to enable transaction verifiability and supports better decision-making. In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on about 11700 images is developed using ResNet50 architecture for object recognition (training accuracy of 94%). We deploy several smart contracts in the Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain platform to validate recommended DIY ideas by blockchain network members. HF is a decentralized ledger technology platform that executes the deployed smart contracts in a secured Docker container to initialize and manage the ledger state. The complete model is delivered on a web platform using Flask, where our recommendation system works on a web scraping script written using Python. Fetching DIY ideas using web-scraping takes nearly 1 second on a desktop machine with an Intel Core-i7 processor with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, installed with Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit operating system, and Python 3.6 package. Further, we evaluate blockchain-based smart contracts' latencies and throughput performances using the hyperledger caliper benchmark. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates blockchain technology and deep learning for the DIY recommender system.	blockchains;smart contracts;recycling;deep learning;recommender systems;waste management;object recognition;distributed ledger;urban planning;local government;deep learning;image recognition;municipal solid waste;blockchain;smart contract;hyperledger fabric;hyperledger caliper;recycle
324	核心技术	TOWARD A FAILURES MODEL FOR COMMUNICATION OF DECENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS WITH BLOCKCHAIN NETWORKS APPLIED IN THE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT	Consensus algorithms seek to solve communication failures between nodes in a blockchain network. However, the communication failures that involve decentralized applications running on Industrial Internet of Things devices have not yet been addressed. Thus, this work aims to fill this research gap, presenting a failure model for communication between decentralized applications and the blockchain network. Initially, the failures are defined and classified; then countermeasures are presented to circumvent the failures; and at the end, the impact of the countermeasures on the performance of decentralized applications, smart contract, and the blockchain network is evaluated. Therefore, this work provides an analysis of the effects of failures and assists in the design of blockchain applications capable of tolerating certain failures and continuing to function.	
325	核心技术	An Effective Sharding Consensus Algorithm for Blockchain Systems	Sharding is the widely used approach to the trilemma of simultaneously achieving decentralization, security, and scalability in traditional blockchain systems. However, existing schemes generally involve problems such as uneven shard arithmetic power and insecure cross-shard transaction processing. In this study, we used the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) as the intra-shard consensus and, here, we propose a new sharding consensus mechanism. Firstly, we combined a jump consistent hash algorithm with signature Anchorhash to minimize the mapping of the node assignment. Then, we improved the process of the cross-shard transaction and used the activity of nodes participating in intra-shard transactions as the criterion for the shard reconfiguration, which ensured the security of the blockchain system. Meanwhile, we analyzed the motivation mechanism from two perspectives. Finally, through theoretical analysis and related experiments, we not only verified that the algorithm can ensure the security of the entire system, but also further clarified the necessary conditions to ensure the effectiveness of the shards and the system on the original basis.	blockchain;sharding;practical byzantine fault tolerance;consensus mechanism;jump consistent hash algorithm;anchorhash;timestamp
326	核心技术	Enabling Secure and Efficient Decentralized Storage Auditing With Blockchain	As a promising alternative solution to cloud storage, decentralized storage networks (DSN) are widely anticipated to develop continuously and reshape the storage market share in the foreseeable future. In particular, one of the most important research problems is how to enforce the quality of service (QoS) in the context of storage solutions. Despite plenty of auditing-related works in the context of cloud storage, none of them can be directly applied to the decentralized storage paradigm. The challenges of designing a feasible storage auditing framework emanate from two aspects: 1) security problems unique to the decentralized settings and 2) performance overhead due to on-chain operations. In this article, we first put forward a basic storage auditing framework that satisfies the security and efficiency requirements, and outperforms the existing approaches. We also identify a critical and overlooked security problem that would compromise the integrity of storage auditing solutions in the blockchain paradigm. With our refined storage auditing design based on customized zero knowledge protocols, we propose a convenient mitigation solution in our revised security model. The evaluation results confirm that our solution would only incur a 10-15 percent increase in the overall auditing costs for common usage scenarios, compared to the basic design.	security;blockchain;cloud computing;ecosystems;urban areas;surges;secure storage;decentralized storage;public auditability;blockchain-enabled auditing;smart contract;lightweight verification;zero knowledge;storage outsourceability
327	虚拟经济	Protocols for the Graphic and Constructive Diffusion of Digital Twins of the Architectural Heritage That Guarantee Universal Accessibility through AR and VR	The objective of this article is to generate and validate a workflow that allows us to use virtual twins obtained from unique buildings of our architectural heritage. These twins will guarantee the preservation and dissemination of cultural assets and will promote universal accessibility through new technologies, such as databases, metaverses, virtual reality, augmented reality or gamification. This universal accessibility is based on new metaverses to offer experiences that allow us to overcome physical barriers and reach any user regardless of their economic or physical condition or their location. To obtain this workflow, we worked with digital twins obtained by photogrammetry. Different databases and metaverses were studied, understanding them as new systems for the representation and dissemination of architecture. These metaverses were critically assessed and screened, looking for the most suitable one to be integrated into an effective workflow that satisfies a series of imposed premises, such as being suitable for use in virtual reality and augmented reality environments. The ultimate goal is the aforementioned universal accessibility.	digital heritage;metaverse;virtual reality;augmented reality;digital twins;virtual museum;digital survey;3d database;photogrammetrydocumentation;reconstruction
328	协同技术	Blockchain-Enabled Efficient Dynamic Cross-Domain Deduplication in Edge Computing	As the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, large amounts of data are needed to be stored and transmitted in the online storage system. Data deduplication can be adopted to improve communication efficiency and minimize storage space. However, in edge computing, data deduplication brings security and functionality requirements that are still unsatisfied. Most existing schemes are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and single-point attacks. Moreover, they impose a heavy burden on resource-constrained edge nodes and do not support cross-domain deduplication. Blockchain is a promising technology because the programmable smart contract can be utilized to perform cross-domain deduplication and guarantee the traceability of data. In this article, an efficient dynamic cross-domain deduplication scheme in blockchain-enabled edge computing is proposed to solve the above problems. Specifically, the smart contract is employed to assist cross-domain deduplication, which also can reduce the storage pressure of edge nodes. Meanwhile, a hash proof system-based oblivious pseudorandom function is created to reduce the time cost of key generation and achieve the security requirements of resistance to brute-force attacks and single-point attacks. The technology of accumulators is adopted to achieve Proofs of Ownership (PoO), which can prevent duplicate-faking attacks. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has a higher security level. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme significantly reduces computation cost and communication overhead, compared with other existing schemes. The smart contract is implemented in the Ethereum test network (i.e., Rinkeby), which shows acceptable gas cost even the functions are called frequently.	security;servers;edge computing;cloud computing;blockchains;smart contracts;internet of things;blockchain;data deduplication;edge computing;security and privacy;smart contractsecure;cloud;internet

331	协同技术	Towards a privacy-preserving smart contract-based data aggregation and quality-driven incentive mechanism for mobile crowdsensing	The crowd's power, combined with the sensing capabilities of smart mobile de-vices, has resulted in the emergence of a revolutionary data acquisition paradigm known as Mobile Crowdsensing. In exchange for re-wards, mobile users collect and share location-specific data values. However, most existing crowdsensing systems built on traditional centralized architectures are highly prone to attacks, intrusions, single point of failure, manipulations, and low reliability. Recently, decentralized blockchain technologies are being applied in mobile crowdsensing systems to ensure workers' privacy, data privacy, and the quality of sensed data at a low service fee. By leveraging blockchain technology, this paper inherits the advantages of the public blockchain without the need for any trusted third-parties. We propose a smart contract-based privacy-preserving data aggregation and quality assessment protocol to infer reliable aggregated results and estimate data quality, wherein, we design a fair quality-driven incentive mechanism to distribute rewards based on the data quality. The protocol ensures a secure, cost-optimal, and reliable aggregation and estimation of the sensed data quality on the public blockchain without disclosing the sensed data's and participants' privacy. We adopt Interplanetary File Systems to offset the blockchain's expensive storage costs. Experiments were conducted using real-world datasets which were implemented on a full-stack on-chain and off-chain decentralized application on the Ethereum blockchain. The experimental results demonstrate our design is highly efficient in achieving privacy-preserving data aggregation and significantly reduces on-chain computation costs.	mobile crowdsensing;smart contracts;data aggregation;incentive mechanism;dapp;ipfs
332	技术治理	Heterogeneous Feature Augmentation for Ponzi Detection in Ethereum	While blockchain technology triggers new industrial and technological revolutions, it also brings new challenges. Recently, a large number of new scams with a "blockchain" sock-puppet continue to emerge, such as Ponzi schemes, money laundering, etc., seriously threatening financial security. Existing fraud detection methods in blockchain mainly concentrate on manual features and graph analytics, which first construct a homogeneous transaction graph using partial blockchain data and then use graph analytics to detect anomaly, resulting in a loss of pattern information. In this brief, we mainly focus on Ponzi scheme detection and propose HFAug, a generic Heterogeneous Feature Augmentation module that can capture the heterogeneous information associated with account behavior patterns and can be combined with existing Ponzi detection methods. HFAug learns the metapath-based behavior characteristics in an auxiliary heterogeneous interaction graph, and aggregates the heterogeneous features to corresponding account nodes in the homogeneous one where the Ponzi detection methods are performed. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our HFAug can help existing Ponzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvement on Ethereum datasets, suggesting the effectiveness of heterogeneous information on detecting Ponzi schemes.	feature extraction;contracts;behavioral sciences;manuals;codes;circuits and systems;blockchains;ethereum;ponzi scheme detection;heterogeneous graph;metapath
333	实体经济	FUNDING HYPERLEDGER BLOCKCHAIN DAPP FOR COVID-19 PANDEMIC	Initial Crypto-Token Offering (ICO) strategy has worked so far to fund any project. In this scheme, the ICO launches a token playing the role of a stockholder's share; the more the people buy tokens, the more the funding for the projects. The stakeholders also earn money if the project gains more reliability and more people buy this token. In other words, an ICO strategy works based on either selling or buying of tokens in the areas of security, utility, equity, etc. However, this paper's focus is only on using oracles and Hyperledger, which means that there is no need to launch a token, instead it uses the network blockchain benefits, particularly oracles and the Ethereum virtual machine, i.e. not the Ethereum blockchain platform but its virtual machine. Since this is a proposal for governmental or corporate usage, the Hyperledger and oracles strategy fits better for this application. Funds for this use-case are gathered in the healthcare field, specifically to reduce the COVID-19 pandemic. The system's reliability is the core for attracting investors and donors to fund the system if it guarantees that resources will get to the right destiny. DAPP is based on a smart contract aligned with the smart societies concept to ensure system sustainability.	hyperledger;oracles;smart contractsystem;encryption;iot
334	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Autonomous Authentication and Integrity for Internet of Battlefield Things in C3I System	In the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), users and sensor-equipped entities send multiple messages to the Command Control Center (CCC) over the network. The authentication and integrity of these messages are crucial because if an adversary or malicious node transmits, alters, or replays these messages, the consequences will be disasters. Current centralized authentication systems are not suitable for the distributed environment because such schemes are prone to a single point of failure, privacy, and scalability issues. Moreover, the high communication overhead caused by centralization increases energy consumption. In this work, we propose a technique called Blockchain-based Autonomous Authentication and Integrity for the Internet of Battlefield Things (BIoBT) for the C3I system. The proposed technique does not require an explicit authentication channel for the authentication of entities because it is performed on the blockchain side when receiving the data. In addition, it provides data integrity and non-repudiation. BIoBT prototype is created, deployed, and tested on the Ethereum test network. The results prove that BIoBT is efficient, cost-effective, and satisfies the security requirements of a distributed environment for IoBT. BIoBT also outperforms contemporary mechanisms in terms of the number of messages required to establish a secure channel, reducing communication overhead and resource consumption.	blockchains;authentication;internet;internet of things;servers;smart contracts;robot sensing systems;command and control systems;military communication;authentication;autonomous;c3i;ethereum;internet of battlefield things (iobt);smart contractattestation;iot
335	市场治理	HAS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AFFECTED THE FLOW OF INFORMATION AMONG CRYPTOCURRENCIES?	In this paper, we investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cryptocurrency market. The direction of information transfer between the 67 digital cryptocurrency markets was evaluated, in particular Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple, and we determined which of them were the most influential in the markets. The comparison of the first half of 2019 (outside the pandemic of COVID-19) against the first semester of 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) was used to analyze the pandemic influence. We found two distinct behaviors: (i) in 2019, Bitcoin, as the primary capitalization bond, presented a more substantial transfer of information than the other cryptocurrencies toward Bitcoin -> Ripple (0.0541), followed by Litecoin -> Ripple (0.0522); (ii) in 2020, the most substantial transfers of information occurred from Ethereum to other cryptocurrencies (Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ripple, in that order). In this period, the weakest transfers happened from Litecoin Ripple and in the opposite direction, with equal value (0.0104). Our results indicate that there was a change in the direction of the information flow between the investigated cryptocurrencies, where ETH became the dominant cryptocurrency during the period of turbulence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.	digital markets;direction;transfer entropy;pandemic;coronavirustransfer entropy
336	市场治理	Do green bonds offer a diversification opportunity during COVID-19?-an empirical evidence from energy, crypto, and carbon markets	The present study is a novel attempt to unravel the connectedness of the green bond with energy, crypto, and carbon markets using the S&P green bond index (RSPGB). We consider MAC global solar energy index (RMGS) and ISE global wind energy index (RIGW) as proxies of the energy market and use bitcoin and the European energy exchange carbon index (REEX) for the cryptocurrency and carbon market. Employing the Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), Barunik and Krehlik (2018), and wavelet coherence econometric techniques, we find that the energy market (RMGS) has the highest connectedness derived from other asset classes, and bitcoin (RBTC) has the least connectedness. Concurrently, we find that the risk transmission is heterogeneous in different scales as the short period has less connectedness than the medium and long run. We conclude that the overall diversification opportunity among green bonds, energy stock, bitcoin, and the carbon market is more in the short-run than in the medium and long-run. In summary, our findings on the green bond market will provide investors, portfolio managers, and policymakers with critical insight into ensuring a sustainable financial market.	green bond;energy market;cryptocurrency;carbon market;connectedness;diversificationfinancial-markets;dynamics;bitcoin
337	实体经济	Centralized and Decentralized Distributed Energy Resource Access Control Implementation Considerations	A global transition to power grids with high penetrations of renewable energy generation is being driven in part by rapid installations of distributed energy resources (DER). New DER equipment includes standardized IEEE 1547-2018 communication interfaces and proprietary communications capabilities. Interoperable DER provides new monitoring and control capabilities. The existence of multiple entities with different roles and responsibilities within the DER ecosystem makes the Access Control (AC) mechanism necessary. In this paper, we introduce and compare two novel architectures, which provide a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) service to the DER ecosystem's entities. Selecting an appropriate RBAC technology is important for the RBAC administrator and users who request DER access authorization. The first architecture is centralized, based on the OpenLDAP, an open source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). The second approach is decentralized, based on a private Ethereum blockchain test network, where the RBAC model is stored and efficiently retrieved via the utilization of a single Smart Contract. We have implemented two end-to-end Proofs-of-Concept (PoC), respectively, to offer the RBAC service to the DER entities as web applications. Finally, an evaluation of the two approaches is presented, highlighting the key speed, cost, usability, and security features.	distributed energy resources;role-based access control;blockchain;ethereum;web applicationblockchain
338	实体经济	Accelerating Decentralized and Partial-Privacy Data Access for VANET via Online/Offline Functional Encryption	Vehicles share information via Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) that is considered the foundation of the intelligent transportation system. Access control from functional encryption (FE) allows secure sharing over encrypted data with both utilization and privacy. However, low-powerful vehicles and the untrusted server incurs that FE-based access control mechanisms are less practical with client-side inefficiency and access unreliability. In this work, we put forth ORAC, an Optimized encrypted Access Control system with partial privacy and Reliability. ORAC is built on top of functional encryption that guarantees data partial privacy and data utilization in VANET, and separates the data access into the offline phase and the online phase, such that most of decryption computation could be done in the offline phase and vehicles could execute the real decryption efficiently. By embedding blockchain transactions into identity records and data storage, ORAC protects data accessed by vehicles from tampering and thereby manages data transfers with high reliability. It can be instantiated directly from pairing-based assumptions and features only the decryption complexity of two exponentiation and two multiplication operations. We give a formal security proof of the instantiation in the semantic security model. We also prototype our scheme by implementing ORAC over Ethereum with two types of smart contracts and the evaluation can demonstrate its efficiency optimization.	vehicular ad hoc networks;servers;blockchains;reliability;encryption;data privacy;access control;functional encryption;online;offline decryption;smart contract;vanetblockchain-enabled internet;control system;management

This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by developing a framework based on a blockchain-enabled smart contract system to address these unethical practices, thus establishing the subcontracting process grounded on system-based trust. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a pilot test, and a survey with construction professionals is conducted to validate its feasibility and effectiveness. The validation results show that the framework can prevent the aforementioned unethical practices and enable Subs to fairly compete for bid awards with proper budgets. Moreover, the validation demonstrates that the framework can enhance trust between the GC and Subs. Future studies should explore the implementation of this framework in the procurement process of real-world construction projects.	blockchain;bid shopping;subcontractor selection;smart contracts;trustframework;quality;issues
340	核心技术	Ranked searchable encryption based on differential privacy and blockchain	In the area of information retrieval, in order to improve search accuracy and reduce communication overhead, there is an increasing tendency to adopt ranked search in engines. Ranked search allows cloud servers to search for the top k most relevant documents based on the relevance score between the query keywords and the documents. Recently, with the increasing popularity of encrypted search technologies, ranked searchable encryption is proposed accordingly which focuses on solving ranked search problem over encrypted databases. However, recent studies show that some privacy protection methods commonly used in ranked searchable encryption, like order-preserving encryption (OPE), have some security problems. These problems may lead to the leakage of the relevant ranking privacy information. Meanwhile, most of the existing ranked searchable encryption schemes do not consider the problem of payment for outsourced services. In this paper, we propose a scheme called ranked searchable encryption based on differential privacy and blockchain (DPB-RSE). Specifically, we first add noise drawn from a Laplace distribution into the relevance score to disturb its value. Then we design a smart contract to verify the correctness of the results returned by the cloud server and realize payment fairness. The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy of search results in this scheme can reach 94% in a small privacy budge.	differential privacy;ranked search;laplace distribution;order-preserving encryption;blockchain;smart contractcloud;efficient
341	核心技术	Consensus algorithm based on verifiable randomness	Consensus algorithms are the core of blockchain technology, which can cause nodes to reach consistency or liveness when there are Byzantine nodes in the network. The generation of public randomness in decentralized networks has been significantly demanding and challenging in terms of the consensus mechanism. Previously, the multi-party random number generator (mRNG), which is a mechanism for creating a single value from the contributions of decentralized multiple parties, was mainly designed based on the verifiable random function. In this study, we first construct novel, efficient verifiable mRNG protocols from any one-way function. The protocols can achieve the properties of fairness, no trusted third party, public verifiability, and manipulation resistance. Subsequently, we propose a delegated PoS (DPoS)-based consensus algorithm that adopts the verifiable mRNG. The new algorithm can solve the problem of low fairness caused by the artificial election of master nodes using DPoS, while addressing the issue of manipulating the consensus process owing to the pseudo-random number generated by the traditional RNG, thereby improving the credibility of the consensus algorithm.

Here, the authors report a highly integrated ring consisting of multimodal sensing and feedback units for augmented interactions in metaverse. Advancements of virtual reality technology pave the way for developing wearable devices to enable somatosensory sensation, which can bring more comprehensive perception and feedback in the metaverse-based virtual society. Here, we propose augmented tactile-perception and haptic-feedback rings with multimodal sensing and feedback capabilities. This highly integrated ring consists of triboelectric and pyroelectric sensors for tactile and temperature perception, and vibrators and nichrome heaters for vibro- and thermo-haptic feedback. All these components integrated on the ring can be directly driven by a custom wireless platform of low power consumption for wearable/portable scenarios. With voltage integration processing, high-resolution continuous finger motion tracking is achieved via the triboelectric tactile sensor, which also contributes to superior performance in gesture/object recognition with artificial intelligence analysis. By fusing the multimodal sensing and feedback functions, an interactive metaverse platform with cross-space perception capability is successfully achieved, giving people a face-to-face like immersive virtual social experience.	pyroelectric nanogenerators;nanowire heater;devices;robot

The research finds that e-CNY will have significant impact on monetary policy: (1) E-CNY will change the structure of money demand, speed up currency circulation, make central bank reserves more controllable and money supply more intelligent; (2) E-CNY will increase the volatility and expansion effect of currency multiplier to a certain extent; (3) E-CNY will dredge the transmission channel of monetary policy so as to improve the transmission effect of existing monetary policy tools. At the same time, based on the organic combination with structural monetary policy tools, it will achieve precise implementation of medium-term lending facilities (MLF), pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and it may bring new monetary policy tools. (4) E-CNY will make the intermediate target of monetary policy more controllable and reliable, and have a positive impact on the target of monetary policy through the smooth transmission of monetary policy channels. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on CBDC, give full play to the positive role of e-CNY in monetary policy, and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.	currency;private;bitcoin;money;world

345	市场治理	Currency stability using blockchain technology	To date, cryptocurrency prices are volatile and many cryptocurrency developers have adopted ad hoc approaches to stabilize their cryptocurrency price. When these currencies are not 100% backed by other valued assets, part of their price volatility may arise from self-fulfilling expectations of a speculative attack (as in Obstfeld (1996)). We show that an exchange rate policy, which is less than 100% backed and dynamically adjusts in response to traders' conversion demand eliminates speculative attacks while, under some conditions, preserving much of the desired exchange rate stability. This dynamic exchange rate policy admits a great deal of discretion to and requires commitment by the party implementing the policy. We demonstrate how to implement this policy using the Ethereum network-a smart contract blockchain environment-and how this implementation yields commitment to the policy. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Most Defi projects provide their own service and simultaneously issue a unique token that can be traded in decentralized exchanges (DEX). However, the values of these tokens have rarely been studied. We confirm that the prices of tokens in the Defi market have a persistent tendency to move together. We also demonstrate that the correlation gradually increased from the Defi market's inception and the price co-movement increased in a bear market, and conversely, decreased in a bull market. Specifically, we find a notable difference in the level of price co-movement between CEX cryptocurrencies and DEX tokens.	defi;co-movement;cryptocurrencies;correlation
347	技术治理	A search-theoretic model of double-spending fraud	We study double-spending attacks in a digital payment system, such as cryptocurrency, wherein agents send transaction messages to facilitate the transfers of digital currencies. The system is imperfect such that the payer can send a double-spending message to transfer the currency to another account owned by herself after the original message is sent, and the payment system may recognize the double-spending message instead of the original one as the real transaction. If this occurs, the seller will not receive the payment, and the payer may retract the payment but keep the merchandise. We consider multiple mechanisms that can be applied to deter double-spending attempts, including a cost to send a message, a currency deposit, and currency deletions. However, applying the above mechanisms is costly. If the probability of detecting fraudulent activity is low, employing fraud deterrents may not be ideal, and allowing for double spending may instead reflect an optimal equilibrium.

348	虚拟经济	Make Web3.0 Connected	Web3.0, often cited to drastically shape our lives, is ubiquitous. However, few literatures have discussed the crucial differentiators that separate Web3:0 from the era we are currently living in. Via a thorough analysis of the recent blockchain infrastructure evolution, we capture a key invariant featuring the evolution, based on which we provide the first academic definition for Web3.0. Our definition is not the only way of understanding Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of Web3:0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key categories of infrastructural enablers for Web3.0: individual smart-contract capable blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers to provide a unified and connected computing platform for Web3:0 applications. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable Web3.0, in this article, we present a design for the third enabler, i.e., the first interoperability platform, namely HyperService, that advances the state-of-the-art by simultaneously delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability and scalability.	web3.0;blockchain interoperability;smart contract
349	虚拟经济	Non-fungible token (NFT) markets on the Ethereum blockchain: temporal development, cointegration and interrelations	The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), transferrable and unique digital assets on public blockchains, has received widespread attention and experienced strong growth since early 2021. This study provides an introduction to NFTs and explores the 14 largest submarkets using data from the Ethereum blockchain between June 2017 and May 2021. The analyses rely on (a) the number of NFT sales, (b) the dollar volume of NFT trades and (c) the number of unique blockchain wallets that traded NFTs. Based on the number of transactions and wallets, the Ethereumbased NFT market peaked at the end of 2017 due to the success of the CryptoKitties project. As of 2021, fewer transactions occur but the traded value is much higher. We find that NFT submarkets are cointegrated and feature various causal short-run connections between them. The success or adoption of younger NFT projects is influenced by that of more established markets. At the same time, the success of newer markets has an impact on the more established projects. The results contribute to the overall understanding of the NFT phenomenon as an emerging asset class and suggest that NFT markets are immature or even inefficient.	nfts;non-fungible tokens;cryptocurrency;cointegration;granger causalitytechnologies;bitcoin
350	虚拟经济	NFTs and Cryptocurrencies-The Metamorphosis of the Economy under the Sign of Blockchain: A Time Series Approach	Although NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and cryptocurrencies are active on the same market, their prices are not so closely related over time. The objective of this paper is to identify the relationship between the two types of assets (NFTs and the cryptocurrencies Ethereum, Crypto Coin, and Bitcoin), using data for the period between September 2020 until February 2022. The conclusions of the study are useful for cryptocurrency and NFT issuers, but also for investors on the financial market who are reconfiguring their portfolios with increasing frequency, and use these new assets for speculative or hedging purposes based on blockchain technology. The results highlighted relationships between NFTs and Ethereum, between Ethereum and Crypto Coin, and between Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ethereum being a bridge between all four. Therefore, NFTs present a relationship with Ethereum, the NFTs price had a causal effect on the price of Ethereum.	nft;bitcoin;ethereum;crypto coin;digitalization;var;granger causalityuser acceptance;technology;tokens
351	虚拟经济	The rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs): a first empirical glimpse	Blockchain technology and smart contracts are catalysts for decentralization and disintermediation. These new technologies reduce transaction costs, agency costs, and offer a basis for trustless social and economic interactions. They are fueling new business models for decentralized platforms and have revolutionized crowdfunding. A recent trend, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), stands to fundamentally transform organizing and governance. DAOs are blockchain-native, decentralized organizations that are collectively owned and managed by their members via smart contracts. In this note, we assess the promises and challenges of DAOs, with a focus on decentralized governance and disintermediation, and offer a first empirical glimpse at the rise and functioning of DAOs. Overall, DAOs may introduce a new era in organizational economics, transforming the global corporate landscape from hierarchical organizations to democratic and distributed organizations powered by organizational entrepreneurship and innovations.	dao;decentralized autonomous organization;blockchain;ethereumgovernance
352	协同技术	Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning via Blockchain Systems	Federated learning enables clients to train a machine learning model jointly without sharing their local data. However, due to the centrality of federated learning framework and the untrustworthiness of clients, traditional federated learning solutions are vulnerable to poisoning attacks from malicious clients and servers. In this paper, we aim to mitigate the impact of the central server and malicious clients by designing a Privacy-preserving Byzantine-robust Federated Learning (PBFL) scheme based on blockchain. Specifically, we use cosine similarity to judge the malicious gradients uploaded by malicious clients. Then, we adopt fully homomorphic encryption to provide secure aggregation. Finally, we use blockchain system to facilitate transparent processes and implementation of regulations. Our formal analysis proves that our scheme achieves convergence and provides privacy protection. Our extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our scheme is robust and efficient. Even if the root dataset is small, our scheme can achieve the same efficiency as FedSGD.	servers;blockchains;collaborative work;computational modeling;training;resists;privacy;federated learning;poisoning attacks;fully homomorphic encryption;blockchain
353	实体经济	ACCORD: A Scalable Multileader Consensus Protocol for Healthcare Blockchain	Blockchain is an emerging distributed and decentralized technology that promises to revolutionize the healthcare sector by securely storing and maintaining incorruptible electronic health record data. Consensus protocols are at the core of blockchain technology. They establish security and integrity in the system by ensuring that the majority of miners are in agreement on all transactions and blocks added to the distributed ledger. While many consensus protocols have been proposed, most of them require heavy computation and are not scalable. In this work, we propose a novel permissioned consensus protocol, named ACCORD, a multi-leader (quorum-based) protocol that achieves fork-resistance, robustness, and scalability. To achieve this, ACCORD consists of three distinct components: 1) an asynchronous quorum selection procedure to designate the creators of future blocks; 2) a block creation protocol run by the quorum to prevent omissions in the presence of honest quorum members; and 3) a decentralized arbitration protocol to ensure consensus by voting. Additionally, we implemented the protocol and conducted experiments to demonstrate scalability, robustness, and fairness.	consensus protocol;protocols;hospitals;robustness;scalability;distributed ledger;computer science;blockchains;consensus protocol;electronic healthcare
354	实体经济	Toward the InterPlanetary Health Layer for the Internet of Medical Things With Distributed Ledgers and Storages	With the dramatic increase of the Internet of Medical Things devices, self and remote health data monitoring is consistently receiving more attention. However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party. The results of several stress tests conducted on a real case study confirmed the feasibility of the proposed solution, which shows good scalability and a modest impact on the application performance measured during the decentralized data access.	distributed ledger;medical services;smart contracts;peer-to-peer computing;internet of medical things;codes;scalability;decentralized internet of medical things;distributed ledger technology;interplanetary file system;interplanetary health layerblockchain;secure

These machineries include the state-of-the-art concepts, M2M communications, Artificial Intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The heart of the fourth industrial revolution is the internet of things (IoT) which is referred as the industrial internet of things (IIoT). It plays a crucial role in providing smart solutions and automation processes to inspire the industry and help in terms of high productivity. This paper reviews the importance of cybersecurity in the fourth industrial revolution as a key context of IIoT. We find that in Industry 4.0, IoT and other computer devices have many security vulnerabilities, and a secure tray is required to resolve these threats. In this paper, we emphasis to discuss challenges towards vulnerabilities and optimized block chain technology in Industry 4.0 which can offer an effective solution to these cybersecurity issues.

In this paper we present a novel algorithmic architecture that tackle this problem in the particular case of Anomaly Detection (or classification of rare events), a setting where typical applications often comprise data with sensible information, but where the scarcity of anomalous examples encourages collaboration. We show how Random Forests can be used as a tool for the development of accurate classifiers with an effective insight-sharing mechanism that does not break the data integrity. Moreover, we explain how the new architecture can be readily integrated in a blockchain infrastructure to ensure the verifiable and auditable execution of the algorithm. Furthermore, we discuss how this work may set the basis for a more general approach for the design of collaborative ensemble-learning methods beyond the specific task and architecture discussed in this paper.	collaboration;collaborative work;anomaly detection;radio frequency;training;computer architecture;task analysis;algorithm auditing;anomaly detection;blockchain;collaborative learningblockchain

358	核心技术	Distributed Random Beacon for Blockchain Based on Share Recovery Threshold Signature	Random beacons play a crucial role in blockchains. Most random beacons in a blockchain are performed in a distributed approach to secure the generation of random numbers. However, blockchain nodes are in an open environment and are vulnerable to adversary reboot attacks. After such an attack, the number of members involved in a random number generation decreases. The random numbers generated by the system become insecure. To solve this problem while guaranteeing fast recovery of capabilities, we designed a threshold signature scheme based on share recovery. A bivariate polynomial was generated among the participants in the distributed key generation phase. While preserving the threshold signature key share, it can also help participants who lost their shares to recover. The same threshold setting for signing and recovery guarantees the security of the system. The results of our scheme show that we take an acceptable time overhead in distributed key generation and simultaneously enrich the share recovery functionality for the threshold signature-based random number generation scheme.	random beacon;blockchain;bivariate polynomial;threshold signature;share recovery
359	市场治理	An analytical approach for evaluating the impact of blockchain technology on sustainable supply chain performance	Nowadays, distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain technology) can play significant roles in improving supply chain management and sustainability. Blockchain technology can support responsible sourcing and ensure compliance with environmental standards by boosting traceability and transparency in sustainable supply chains. Nevertheless, blockchain technology has not been widely applied in this field due to the lack of familiarity of managers with its intrinsic characteristics. This study investigates the performance improvement, arising from the blockchain implementation, to address the problem of managerial conservatism and this technology adoption. Accordingly, an analytical approach is proposed to identify blockchain technology adoption enablers and analyze their impact on supply chain performance. At first, the main enablers, derived from the literature review, are explored using network theory. The existing causal relationships between enablers are extracted based on a multi-expertise team members' agreement. Then, the fuzzy inference system is employed to determine the weights of relationships between the identified enablers and supply chain performance-related targets. After modeling the extracted causal relationships using the fuzzy cognitive map model, a scenario is defined for each enabler, and its impact on improving supply chain performance is estimated by implementing the hybrid learning algorithm. Finally, the obtained outputs are used to prioritize the blockchain technology adoption enablers using the fuzzy data envelopment analysis model. The result of this study implies that the blockchain technology can have a significant impact on mineral supply chain performance by creating smart contracts and enhancing environmental sustainability, traceability, and transparency.	blockchain technology adoption;sustainable mineral supply chain;network theory;fuzzy cognitive map;fuzzy data envelopment analysisfuzzy cognitive maps;management;algorithm;adoption;industry

361	实体经济	Blockchain Technology for Secure Supply Chain Management: A Comprehensive Review	Supply chain management (SCM) is a core corporate activity responsible for moving commodities and services from one point to another through a variety of stakeholders. The traditional SCM is based on a centralized approach managed at the central headquarter, and all other sub-offices get instructions from the main office. Some major issues with present SCM systems are security, transactional transparency, traceability, stakeholder involvement, product counterfeiting, additional delays, fraud, and instabilities. Blockchain (BC) emerges as a technology that can manage the data and build trust efficiently and transparently. It can also aid in transaction authorization and verification in the supply chain or payments without a third party. To address the present SCM issues, BC technology is a feasible solution. Motivated by the aforementioned considerations, in this paper, we present a survey on the adoption of BC in SCM. This paper undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the literature on BC characteristics, implementations, and business consequences in various SCM. This Blockchain-centered study, in particular, discloses the research state and delineates future research directions by studying and analyzing 97 up-to-date publications highlighting BC's supply chain uses. Transparency and traceability, information sharing, product anti-counterfeiting, and building trust are the major aspects propelling BC's implementation in SCM. Further, we analyzed various applications of SCM in which BC can be used as a probable technology to secure all transactions. Then, we have highlighted open issues and research challenges for adopting BC technology in SCM that open the doors for beginners eager to start work in this amazing area.	supply chains;stakeholders;software;security;supply chain management;companies;blockchains;blockchain;security;supply chain management;traceability;transparencytraceability;trust;logistics;system
362	实体经济	Application of Blockchain Technology in Intellectual Property Protection	The emergence of digital copyright in the internet era altered the traditional method of information dissemination and triggered a new copyright revolution, which benefited copyright owners by increasing revenue. However, as a result of the efficiency and convenience of technical capture, the data-based form of copyright faces new challenges and the emergence of a large number of infringement acts has become a barrier to the development of the digital copyright industry. Blockchain technology is decentralized, impenetrable, timestamped, traceable, and capable of smart contracts, among other characteristics. It was initially applied in the financial sector before being expanded to other sectors, resulting in a variety of blockchain + X models. The application of blockchain technology to digital copyright protection represents an attempt to protect copyright owners' rights through the use of a novel technical method and protection concept, and it has a bright future. This study analyzes the current state of digital copyright protection in detail, discusses the benefits of applying blockchain technology in three areas: digital copyright registration and confirmation, transaction monitoring, and evidence maintenance, as well as the potential difficulties associated with the application of blockchain technology, and finally considers and proposes the system design for blockchain technology in the application of digital copyright protection. The study discovered that by utilizing blockchain technology to establish a unified blockchain digital copyright protection platform, it is possible to completely and efficiently record the entire process of copyright registration and confirmation, monitor data capture infringement, provide objective electronic evidence, reduce the cost of copyright owner rights protection, and increase the success rate of judicial remedies.	
363	实体经济	Research on Data Security Communication Scheme of Heterogeneous Swarm Robotics System in Emergency Scenarios	In emergency scenarios where the on-site information is completely lacking or the original environmental state has been completely changed, autonomous and mobile swarm robotics are used to quickly build a rescue support system to ensure the safety of follow-up rescuers and improve rescue efficiency. To address the data security problem caused by the complex and changeable topology of the heterogeneous swarm robotics network in the process of building the rescue support system, this paper introduced a decentralized data security communication scheme for heterogeneous swarm robotics. First, we built a decentralized network topology model by using base robot, communication robotics, and business robotics, and it can ensure the stability of the system. Moreover, based on the decentralized network topology model, we designed a storage model using the master-slave blockchain method. The master chain is composed of base robot and communication robotics, which mainly store the digests of robot data in multiple slave chains to reach the global data consensus of the system. The slave chains are composed of business robotics and communication robotics, which mainly store all data on the slave chains to reach the local data consensus of the system. The whole data storage system adopts the Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to elect proxy nodes to participate in the data consensus tasks in the system and to ensure the data consistency of each robot node in the decentralized network. Additionally, a prototype of the heterogeneous swarm robotics system based on the master-slave chains is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the scheme effectively solves the data security problem caused by the unstable communication link of the heterogeneous swarm robotics system.	heterogeneous swarm robotics;blockchain;dpos consensus mechanism;byzantine generals problem;data securityinternet

However, few data pricing model meets the requirements to the scenario. Thus, a suitable mechanism to measure the data value for clinical research is required.Methods: Extensive documents were acquired and analyzed, including a rare disease list from the National Health Commission, data structures of the electronic medical records (EMR) system, diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) regulations from the Health Commission of Zhejiang Province, and the Clinical Service Price List of Zhejiang Province. Nine senior experts were invited as consultants from hospital and enterprises with professional field of clinical research, data governance, and health economics. After brainstorming and expert evaluation, seven data attributes were identified as the main factors affecting the value of medical data. Different weights were assigned for each attribute based on its influence on data value. Each attribute was quantized to an index based on proposed algorithms. The data value models for chronic diseases and other diseases were distinguished given the different sensitivity of data timeliness. A simulation system using blockchain and federated learning techniques was constructed to verify the data pricing model in the scenario of clinical research.Results: A comprehensive clinical data pricing model is proposed and the simulation of three research centers with 50 million real clinical data entries was conducted to verify its effectiveness. It demonstrates that the proposed model can compute medical data value quantitatively.Conclusions: Quantitative evaluation of the value of medical data for multicenter clinical research based on the proposed data pricing model works well in simulation. This model will be improved by real-world applications in the near future.	data value;data pricing;multicenter research;blockchain;federated learninghealth
365	协同技术	Deep Q-Learning Technique for Offloading Offline/Online Computation in Blockchain-Enabled Green IoT-Edge Scenarios	The number of Internet of Things (IoT)-related innovations has recently increased exponentially, with numerous IoT objects being invented one after the other. Where and how many resources can be transferred to carry out tasks or applications is known as computation offloading. Transferring resource-intensive computational tasks to a different external device in the network, such as a cloud, fog, or edge platform, is the strategy used in the IoT environment. Besides, offloading is one of the key technological enablers of the IoT, as it helps overcome the resource limitations of individual objects. One of the major shortcomings of previous research is the lack of an integrated offloading framework that can operate in an offline/online environment while preserving security. This paper offers a new deep Q-learning approach to address the IoT-edge offloading enabled blockchain problem using the Markov Decision Process (MDP). There is a substantial gap in the secure online/offline offloading systems in terms of security, and no work has been published in this arena thus far. This system can be used online and offline while maintaining privacy and security. The proposed method employs the Post Decision State (PDS) mechanism in online mode. Additionally, we integrate edge/cloud platforms into IoT blockchain-enabled networks to encourage the computational potential of IoT devices. This system can enable safe and secure cloud/edge/IoT offloading by employing blockchain. In this system, the master controller, offloading decision, block size, and processing nodes may be dynamically chosen and changed to reduce device energy consumption and cost. TensorFlow and Cooja's simulation results demonstrated that the method could dramatically boost system efficiency relative to existing schemes. The findings showed that the method beats four benchmarks in terms of cost by 6.6%, computational overhead by 7.1%, energy use by 7.9%, task failure rate by 6.2%, and latency by 5.5% on average.	blockchain;deep learning;iot;offloading;qos;privacyresource-allocation;optimization;identification;networks
366	协同技术	A Continuous Authentication Protocol Without Trust Authority for Zero Trust Architecture	Zero-trust security is a novel concept to cope with intricate access, which can not be handled by the conventional perimeter-based architecture anymore. The device-to-device continuous authentication protocol is one of the most crucial cornerstones, especially in the IoT scenario. In the zero-trust architecture, trust does not rely on any position, person or device. However, to the best of our knowledge, almost all existing device-to-device continuous authentication relies on a trust authority or a node to generate secret keys or secret values. This is betrayed by the principle of zero-trust architecture. In this paper, we employ the blockchain to eliminate the trusted node. One node is chosen to produce the public parameter and secret keys for two entities through the practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism. Additionally, the devices are categorized into three folds: trusted device, suspected device and untrusted device. Only the first two can participate in authentication, and they have different lengths of security parameters and intervals to reach a better balance between security and efficiency. Then we prove the security of the initial authentication part in the eCK model and give an informal analysis of the continuous authentication part. Finally, we implement the proposed protocol on simulated devices. The result illustrates that our scheme is highly efficient, and the continuous authentication only costs around 0.1ms.	continuous authentication;zero-trust architecture;device-to-device;blockchain;iotinternet;management;scheme
367	协同技术	A Blockchain-Enabled Secure Digital Twin Framework for Early Botnet Detection in IIoT Environment	Resource constraints in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) result in brute-force attacks, transforming them into a botnet to launch Distributed Denial of Service Attacks. The delayed detection of botnet formation presents challenges in controlling the spread of malicious scripts in other devices and increases the probability of a high-volume cyberattack. In this paper, we propose a secure Blockchain-enabled Digital Framework for the early detection of Bot formation in a Smart Factory environment. A Digital Twin (DT) is designed for a group of devices on the edge layer to collect device data and inspect packet headers using Deep Learning for connections with external unique IP addresses with open connections. Data are synchronized between the DT and a Packet Auditor (PA) for detecting corrupt device data transmission. Smart Contracts authenticate the DT and PA, ensuring malicious nodes do not participate in data synchronization. Botnet spread is prevented using DT certificate revocation. A comparative analysis of the proposed framework with existing studies demonstrates that the synchronization of data between the DT and PA ensures data integrity for the Botnet detection model training. Data privacy is maintained by inspecting only Packet headers, thereby not requiring the decryption of encrypted data.	digital twin;blockchain;smart contracts;botnet detection;cybersecurityiot;lightweight;internet;system
368	实体经济	LAP-BFT: Lightweight Asynchronous Provable Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Mechanism for UAV Network	Mission-oriented UAV networks operate in nonsecure, complex environments with time-varying network partitioning and node trustworthiness. UAV networks are thus essentially asynchronous distributed systems with the Byzantine General problem, whose availability depends on the tolerance of progressively more erroneous nodes in the course of a mission. To address the resource-limited nature of UAV networks, this paper proposes a lightweight asynchronous provable Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus method. The consensus method reduces the communication overhead by splitting the set of local trusted state transactions and then dispersing the reliable broadcast control transmission (DRBC), introduces vector commitments to achieve multivalue Byzantine consensus (PMVBA) for identity and data in a provable manner and reduces the computational complexity, and the data stored on the chain is only the consensus result (global trustworthiness information of the drone nodes), avoiding the blockchain's "storage inflation" problem. This makes the consensus process lighter in terms of bandwidth, computation and storage, ensuring the longevity and overall performance of the UAV network during the mission. Through QualNet simulation platform, existing practical asynchronous consensus algorithms are compared, and the proposed method performs better in terms of throughput, consensus latency and energy consumption rate.	mission-oriented uav network;byzantine fault-tolerant;lightweight asynchronous provable consensusinformation;algorithm
369	实体经济	A Security-Enhanced Query Result Verification Scheme for Outsourced Data in Location-Based Services	Location-based services (LBSs) facilitate people's lives; location-based service providers (LBSPs) usually outsource services to third parties to provide better services. However, the third party is a dishonest entity that might return incorrect or incomplete query results under the consideration of saving storage space and computation resources. In this paper, we propose a security-enhanced query result verification scheme (SEQRVS) for the outsourced data in a LBS. Specifically, while retaining fine-grained query result verification, we improve the construction process of verification objects to enhance the security of the outsourced data. To prevent the third party from deducing the knowledge of the outsourced data stored in itself (statistically), our scheme designs a novel storage structure to enhance the ability of privacy preservation for the outsourced data. Furthermore, based on the secure keyword search and query result verification mode proposed in our scheme, the user cannot only verify the correctness and completeness of the query result but also achieve consistency verification by the blockchain. Finally, the security analysis and extensive simulation results show the security and practicality of the proposed scheme.	location-based service (lbs);query result verification;privacy preservation;blockchain
370	市场治理	Analysis of inter-transaction time fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market	We analyze tick-by-tick data representing major cryptocurrencies traded on some different cryptocurrency trading platforms. We focus on such quantities like the inter-transaction times, the number of transactions in time unit, the traded volume, and volatility. We show that the inter-transaction times show long-range power-law autocorrelations. These lead to multifractality expressed by the right-side asymmetry of the singularity spectra f ( alpha ) indicating that the periods of increased market activity are characterized by richer multifractality compared to the periods of quiet market. We also show that neither the stretched exponential distribution nor the power-law-tail distribution is able to model universally the cumulative distribution functions of the quantities considered in this work. For each quantity, some data sets can be modeled by the former and some data sets by the latter, while both fail in other cases. An interesting, yet difficult to account for, observation is that parallel data sets from different trading platforms can show disparate statistical properties.

Thus, it provides a sustainable competitive advantage to the companies. However, these systems have some technological, organizational, and environmental challenges that can be addressed in the long term.

373	实体经济	Cloud Platform Credibility Assessment System Based on D-S Theory and Blockchain Technology	Even well-known cloud platforms will have sudden credibility problems in the long-term application process. Effectively evaluating the credibility of the cloud platform and providing users with scientific evaluation results can help users reasonably choose a trusted cloud platform. However, there are often conflicting opinions or malicious assessments in the process of assessment. In addition, the personal privacy information of the users participating in the assessment is at risk of being leaked, and the data that the users have evaluated is also easy to be modified. In order to solve the above problems, this paper defines the credibility category and confidence interval of cloud platform, puts forward a quantitative assessment method combined with fuzzy theory, and realizes the fusion of different users' assessment results based on D-S theory. On this basis, this paper further proposes an effective cloud platform credibility assessment system combined with blockchain technology. Finally, through experimental analysis, this paper shows that the credibility assessment system proposed in this paper is feasible and illustrates the characteristics of the system through method comparison. The system solves the problem of conflicting information in the assessment process, can effectively assess the credibility of the cloud platform, and effectively protects user privacy and the security of assessment data with blockchain technology.	model;evaluate;risk
374	实体经济	Tailored Blockchain Applications for the Natural Gas Industry: The Case Study of SOCAR	Blockchain technology has emerging areas of deployment in diverse sectors and use cases. In this study, several potential application areas of blockchain with promising benefits have been identified in the natural gas industry. There is no single solution that can address different challenges and meet disparate requirements. Therefore, it is important to understand the needs of the natural gas industry and propose appropriate blockchain solutions. Moreover, in the literature, there is a lack of detailed case studies involving industrial experts from the natural gas sector. Expert opinion can be useful for prioritizing the most needed or expected blockchain application areas among several options. By considering privacy, authentication, speed, security, energy consumption, and costs, suitable blockchain types and consensus mechanisms can be determined. This study presents one of the first detailed case studies for tailored applications of blockchain in the natural gas industry.

375	虚拟经济	Research on the Application of Blockchain Technology in Coal Supply Chain Finance	The implementation of measures to limit electricity consumption in many provinces of China has caused coal prices to rise irrationally, further aggravating the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises in the supply chain. Small and medium-sized enterprises lacking funds cannot effectively participate in the green transformation and development of the coal industry, which slows down the sustainable development process of the coal industry. Under the current background of low-carbon advocacy, blockchain technology can reasonably allocate resources and efficiently process information, thereby providing a solution for this financing problem. This paper first proposes a coal accounts receivable financing model based on blockchain technology, then builds a coal accounts receivable financing system dominated by ports through blockchain technology. Finally, the Stackelberg yield-benefit model is used to analyze the income function of each participant in the process of accounts receivable financing. The results show that the use of blockchain technology can reduce the financing condition of financial institutions and improve the maximum income of cooperative enterprises in the chain while solving the financing problems of small and medium-sized enterprises in the coal supply chain. This study provides practical significance and theoretical value for promoting the transformation and upgrading of coal enterprises and accelerating the opening of the sustainable development model of the coal industry.	blockchain technology;accounts receivable financing;stackelberg model;coal;sustainable development

The research method we followed starts form a deep study of the state of the art that showed us the need to invest more research effort on delivering open and flexible online environments to enable students in finding and passing courses with final formal certifications of learning. To reach this goal, we (i) designed a complete system architecture around a standard (SCORM compliant) learning management system in order the approach should be reusable as much as possible. We (ii) introduced specific modules to separate responsibilities on the definition and issuing of formal certifications using digital badges according to the IMS Open Badges standard. We (iii) exploited blockchain technology to make the sharing of badges among actors more secure, transparent and open. Finally, we (iv) introduced a new recommendation algorithm based on machine learning techniques to give advice to students about study materials and learning paths. We spent a significant part of our effort carrying out both a functional and quantitative validation of our proposal. The obtained results are presented through a laboratory case study that involves all the components of the architecture, and the outcomes are discussed providing numerical performance indicators. In conclusion, the resulting platform introduces digital badges and blockchain as tools to share recognized achievements among earners and issuers, and machine learning algorithms to provide students with recommendations on the learning material, learning objects, courses and learning paths more suitable for their learning styles.	open badges;blockchain;recommendation system;online competences certification;digital brickhigher-education;technology
377	实体经济	Analysis of Malicious Node Identification Algorithm of Internet of Vehicles under Blockchain Technology: A Case Study of Intelligent Technology in Automotive Engineering	False messages sent by malicious or selfish vehicle nodes will reduce the operation efficiency of the Internet of Vehicles, and can even endanger drivers in serious cases. Therefore, it is very important to detect malicious vehicle nodes in the network in a timely manner. At present, the existing research on detecting malicious vehicle nodes in the Internet of Vehicles has some problems, such as difficulties with identification and a low detection efficiency. Blockchain technology cannot be tampered with or deleted and has open and transparent characteristics. Therefore, as a shared distributed ledger in decentralized networking, blockchain can promote collaboration between transactions, processing and interaction equipment, and help to establish a scalable, universal, private, secure and reliable car networking system. This paper puts forward a block-network-based malicious node detection mechanism. Using blockchain technology in a car network for malicious node identification algorithm could create a security scheme that can ensure smooth communication between network vehicles. A consensus on legal vehicle identification, message integrity verification, false message identification and malicious vehicle node identification form the four parts of the security scheme. Based on the public-private key mechanism and RSA encryption algorithm, combined with the malicious node identification algorithm in the Internet of Vehicles, the authenticity of the vehicle's identity and message is determined to protect the vehicle's security and privacy. First, a blockchain-based, malicious node detection architecture is constructed for the Internet of vehicles. We propose a malicious node identification algorithm based on the blockchain consensus mechanism. Combined the above detection architecture with the consensus mechanism, a comprehensive and accurate verification of vehicle identity and message authenticity is ensured, looking at the four aspects of vehicle identification, accounting node selection, verification of transmission message integrity and identification of the authenticity of transmission messages. Subsequently, the verification results will be globally broadcast in the Internet of Vehicles to suppress malicious behavior, further ensure that reliable event messages are provided for the driver, improve the VANET operation environment, and improve the operation efficiency of the Internet of Vehicles. Comparing the proposed detection mechanism using simulation software, the simulation results show that the proposed blockchain-based trust detection mechanism can effectively improve the accuracy of vehicle node authentication and identification of false messages, and improve network transmission performance in the Internet of Vehicles environment.	blockchain technology;intelligent technology;internet of vehicles;malicious nodes;identification algorithm
378	实体经济	Approach to an Equivalent Freight-Based Sustainable Joint-Quotation Strategy for Shipping Blockchain Alliance	To improve the sustainability of the shipping industry, a practice of establishing a new type of shipping alliance based on blockchain has been implemented. In this practice, the following question emerges: How will shipping lines achieve sustainable profit improvement? This paper focuses on the freight decision-making problem by constructing a multi-round joint-quotation strategy. This paper also demonstrates the potential impact of a joint quotation strategy on the blockchain-based open freight market from a theoretical perspective. The numerical experiment results show that, compared with the initial state, the joint quotation strategy can help to stabilize shipping demands and reduce the fluctuation in overall demands. In this strategy, the freight level needs to be high to maximize profits. However, part of the demands will be sacrificed as a result. Moreover, the optimal equilibrium solution under the joint quotation strategy is relatively vulnerable to changes in the competitive relationship among the members of an alliance. In addition, the joint quotation may also be resolutely resisted by the shipper due to monopoly risk, resulting in a major risk of a sharp reduction in demand. The findings in this paper offer a decision-making reference for the sustainable development of the shipping industry.	shipping blockchain alliance;joint quotation;container shipping line;equivalent freight;sustainabilitysupply chain efficiency;container carriers;priority;service
379	核心技术	Implementation and Optimization of Zero-Knowledge Proof Circuit Based on Hash Function SM3	With the increasing demand for privacy protection in the blockchain, the universal zero-knowledge proof protocol has been developed and widely used. Because hash function is an important cryptographic primitive in a blockchain, the zero-knowledge proof of hash preimage has a wide range of application scenarios. However, it is hard to implement it due to the transformation of efficiency and execution complexity. Currently, there are only zero-knowledge proof circuits of some widely used hash functions that have been implemented, such as SHA256. SM3 is a Chinese hash function standard published by the Chinese Commercial Cryptography Administration Office for the use of electronic authentication service systems, and hence might be used in several cryptographic applications in China. As the national cryptographic hash function standard, the zero-knowledge proof circuit of SM3 (Chinese Commercial Cryptography) has not been implemented. Therefore, this paper analyzed the SM3 algorithm process, designed a new layered circuit structure, and implemented the SM3 hash preimage zero-knowledge proof circuit with a circuit size reduced by half compared to the automatic generator. Moreover, we proposed several extended practical protocols based on the SM3 zero-knowledge proof circuit, which is widely used in blockchain.	sm3;zero-knowledge proof;arithmetic circuit;privacy preserving
380	实体经济	A Novel Credible Carbon Footprint Traceability System for Low Carbon Economy Using Blockchain Technology	To achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, many countries have established regional carbon emission trading markets and tried to build a low-carbon economic system. At present, the implementation of carbon emission trading and low-carbon economic systems faces many challenges such as manipulation, corruption, opacity, lack of trust, and lack of data tracking means. The application of blockchain technology can perfectly solve the above problems. However, the data recorded on a blockchain are often multi-type and heterogeneous, and users at different levels such as regulators, enterprises, and consumers have different requirements for data types and granularity. This requires a quick and trustworthy method for monitoring the carbon footprint of enterprises and products. In this paper, the carbon footprint traceability of enterprises and products is taken as an application scenario, and the distributed traceability concept of "traceability off the chain and verification on the chain" is adopted. By reconstructing the pointer of the file structure of the distributed storage, an interactive traceability structure supporting type filtering is constructed, which enables fast retrieval and locating of carbon emission data in the mixed data on the chain. The experimental results show that using the interactive traceability structure that supports type filtering for traceability not only releases the computing power of full nodes but also greatly improves the traceability efficiency of the long-span transaction chain. The proposed carbon footprint traceability system can rapidly trace and track data on an enterprise's and a product's carbon footprint, as well as meet the needs of users at all levels for traceability. It also offers more advantages when handling large amounts of data requests.	carbon emission trading;carbon footprint;blockchain;ipfs;interactive traceability;traceability off the chain;type filteringemission;image
381	核心技术	BENS-B5G: Blockchain-Enabled Network Slicing in 5G and Beyond-5G (B5G) Networks	Fifth-generation (5G) technology is anticipated to allow a slew of novel applications across a variety of industries. The wireless communication of the 5G and Beyond-5G (B5G) networks will accommodate a wide variety of services and user expectations, including intense end-user connectivity, sub-1 ms delay, and a transmission rate of 100 Gbps. Network slicing is envisioned as an appropriate technique that can meet these disparate requirements. The intrinsic qualities of a blockchain, which has lately acquired prominence, mean that it is critical for the 5G network and B5G networks. In particular, the incorporation of blockchain technology into B5G enables the network to effectively monitor and control resource utilization and sharing. Using blockchain technology, a network-slicing architecture referred to as the Blockchain Consensus Framework is introduced that allows resource providers to dynamically contract resources, especially the radio access network (RAN) schedule, to guarantee that their end-to-end services are effortlessly executed. The core of our methodology is comprehensive service procurement, which offers the fine-grained adaptive allocation of resources through a blockchain-based consensus mechanism. Our objective is to have Primary User-Secondary User (PU-SU) interactions with a variety of services, while minimizing the operation and maintenance costs of the 5G service providers. A Blockchain-Enabled Network Slicing Model (BENS), which is a learning-based algorithm, is incorporated to handle the spectrum resource allocation in a sophisticate manner. The performance and inferences of the proposed work are analyzed in detail.	blockchain;network slicing;5g communications;radio access network;5g-core network functions;beyond-5g
382	实体经济	Application of Blockchain Technology in Water Rights Trading in the Irrigation Area under the Internet-of-Things Environment	Water rights trading is an important way to solve the shortage of water resources. Combined with the characteristics of water resources and the requirements of the market economy, the organic combination of the government and the market should be strengthened. Through the establishment of a water rights system and a water rights trading market, the implementation of water rights trading will be promoted. Due to the decentralized and distributed structure, blockchain technology greatly reduces its intermediary cost in the application process. The tamper-resistant timestamp feature can realize data tracking and information anticounterfeiting, and flexible programming attributes can promote the specification of market order. Firstly, the reasons for water rights trading are studied, and the water rights trading system is analyzed. It is found that the system has the problems of the cumbersome transaction process and high transaction costs. According to the characteristics of water rights trading, the alliance chain Hyperledger Fabric is selected as the underlying network system of the trading system. Secondly, combined with water rights trading, Hyperledger Fabric multichannel technology is used to design a three-channel accounting method, and the chain code for water rights trading is designed and implemented based on the Go language. CouchDB is adopted to store key-value data, and Ubuntu, Docker, and Docker Compose are used to construct an operating environment of the chain code. Finally, the proposed system is tested. The test findings reveal that the distributed water volume of experimental area 1 is 41.8368 million m(3), the current water volume is 23.831 million m(3), and the quota management water volume is 20.432 million m(3). The distributed water volume in area 2 is 40.4605 million m(3), the current water volume is 4317.64 m(3), and the quota management water volume is 77.4795 million m(3). The distributed water volume in area 3 is 65.6928 million m(3), the current water volume is 77.472 million m(3), and the quota management water volume is 64.412 million m(3). The water rights trading system based on Hyperledger Fabric can record each transaction data, which can be stored in each node, and the data stored in each node are the same. The proposed scheme provides a certain reference for the application of blockchain technology in water rights trading in irrigation areas.	river-basin;productivity
383	实体经济	Towards Design and Development of Security Assessment Framework for Internet of Medical Things	The majority of medical equipment in use today does not have built-in security features. As a result, whether linked to a hospital system or the cloud, these devices' built-in weaknesses make them vulnerable to a variety of cyberattacks. In hospitals and clinics, hackers can breach equipment, manipulate data, and disrupt facilities, putting patients' health as well as their lives in jeopardy. A professional can manage cybersecurity threats by lowering the attack surface of the system. Security analysis, whether as a means to detect possible vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers or as a means to prevent cyberattacks, plays an important role in risk mitigation. In addition, throughout the pre-market and post-market phases, security checks are required. This study presents a paradigm for incorporating security check concepts into medical device design and development and healthcare big data security. The security of devices and healthcare data is tested by the integrated fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS method. After the security check of devices, with the parameters security-checked for data, the algorithm is designed and implemented. As a result, the appropriate customized security controls are prompted in order to impede the attack.	medical device;healthcare;big data;security;cybersecurity;ahp;topsisblockchain;software;attacks;devices;system
384	协同技术	Challenges in Integration of Heterogeneous Internet of Things	Internet of Things (IoT) is considered the upcoming industrial and academic revolution in the technological world having billions of things and devices connected to the Internet. These connected devices are heterogeneous. They have different standards and technologies which communicate through different protocols. Therefore, the implementation of IoT on a large scale is difficult due to these heterogeneity challenges. This motivated us to overcome the scaling problem of IoT by identifying the challenges from the literature and providing solutions. This study is based on the identification of the heterogeneous challenges with solutions via a systematic literature review. A total of 81 primary sources were selected. After extracting and synthesizing the data, we identified 14 different IoT heterogeneity challenges. Some of the identified challenges are "heterogeneity of devices," "heterogeneity in formats of data," "heterogeneity in communication," and "interoperability issue due to heterogeneity." The identified challenges have been analyzed from digital libraries and timeframe perspectives. Furthermore, we have found a total of 81 solutions for those challenges, with at least 5 unique solutions for each challenge. In the future, we will categorize the challenges and prioritize the solutions by using a multi-criteria decision-making problem.	iot;communication;management;blockchain;networks;platform;devices;interoperability;protocol;system
385	协同技术	Trusted and Secure Blockchain-Based Architecture for Internet-of-Medical-Things	The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) global market has grown and developed significantly in recent years, and the number of IoMT devices is increasing every year. IoMT systems are now very popular and have become part of our everyday life. However, such systems should be properly protected to preventing unauthorized access to the devices. One of the most popular security methods that additionally relies on real-time communication is Blockchain. Moreover, such a technique can be supported by the Trusted Third Party (TTP), which guarantees data immutability and transparency. The research and industrial community has predicted the proliferation of Blockchain-based IoMT (BIoMT), for providing security, privacy, and effective insurance processing. A connected environment comprises some of the unique features of the IoMT in the form of sensors and devices that capture and measure, recognize and classify, assess risk, notify, make conclusions, and take action. Distributed communication is also unique due to the combination of the fact that the Blockchain cannot be tampered with and the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technique, especially compared to the traditional cloud-based techniques where the reliance of IoMT systems on the centralized cloud makes it somewhat vulnerable. This paper proposes a Blockchain-based technique oriented on IoMT applications with a focus on maintaining Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (the CIA triad) of data communication in the system. The proposed solution is oriented toward trusted and secure real-time communication. The presented method is illustrated by an example of a cloud-based hospital application. Finally, the security aspects of the proposed approach are studied and analyzed in detail.	blockchain;blockchain-based internet-of-medical-things (biomt);cia triad;internet-of-medical-things (iomt);peer-to-peer (p2p);secure;trusted;trusted third party (ttp)
386	实体经济	Protection of Jingdezhen Ceramic Heritage Based on Blockchain Technology	Jingdezhen ceramic heritage is the largest existing ceramic cultural heritage in China, with the richest connotation and the most complete system. It has the characteristics of strong systematization, complicated preservation, and diversified use. With the vigorous development of cultural industry, Jingdezhen's ceramic heritage has a broad application prospect, but at the same time, it faces the problem of being destroyed or improperly developed. With the progress of science and technology and the development of machinery, the traditional hand-made porcelain technology of Jingdezhen ceramics is gradually being eliminated. The value and distinctive feature of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage is the importance and necessity of its protection, and the protection of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage has become an urgent problem to be solved. In order to solve this problem, this paper takes the protection of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage as the research object, analyzes the characteristics and protection status of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage, and applies blockchain technology to the protection of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage, which promotes the protection of ceramic heritage. The decentralized, traceable, and open characteristics of blockchain technology provide innovative technical support for the digital construction of ceramic heritage and strong technical support for the protection of ceramic heritage. The results show that by analyzing the current situation of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage protection and construction, the digital model of Jingdezhen ceramic heritage based on blockchain technology is established by combining blockchain technology with digital construction of ceramic heritage, and a digital identity is built for Jingdezhen ceramics. The collected Jingdezhen ceramic information is attached to the blockchain, which ensures its unique and effective identity information, realizes the integration of Jingdezhen ceramic information, and actively promotes the informatization and standardization of ceramic heritage protection. The research results provide new ideas for Jingdezhen ceramic heritage protection and theoretical support for heritage protection and inheritance.	intangible cultural-heritage;information
387	实体经济	Blockchain Integrated with Principal Component Analysis: A Solution to Smart Security against Cyber-Attacks	Digitalization of financial institutes, industries, and organizations to provide fast online services needs a large number of Internet connections and different types of networks. The presence of a large number of digital networks makes operational communication and data transfer vulnerable to different cyber-attacks. So, to secure the system, there must be a mechanism present to detect malicious activities and give an alarm to the operator/HMI. A numerous intrusion detection system is present in this era but still, the intruders get access to the network and create an economical loss. Blockchain is a new path to gain the trust in the cyber-security field. Researchers have been working on the term "blockchain technology" for the past few years. In a growing digital environment, blockchain is a novel technology that provides various advantages. This paper identifies and examines the possible way to enhance the blockchain capability by integrating with principal component analysis (PCA). The bad data are removed from the real-time data set and then pass through the blockchain mechanism to identify the threats. The results of the investigation and analysis demonstrate that, when compared to the traditional approach, the PCA integration with the blockchain method proposed in this paper may reduce detection time and boost detection rate.

Unlike stock market manipulators, cryptocurrency manipulators openly declare their intentions to pump specific coins, rather than trying to deceive investors. Puzzlingly, people join in despite negative expected returns. In a simple framework, we demonstrate how overconfidence and gambling preferences can explain participation in these schemes. Analyzing a sample of 355 cases in 6 months, we find strong empirical support for both mechanisms. Pumps generate extreme price distortions of 65% on average, abnormal trading volumes in the millions of dollars, and large wealth transfers between participants.	market manipulation;pump-and-dump;cryptocurrencies;overconfidence;gamblingstock-price manipulation;overconfidence;returns
389	市场治理	Quantiles dependence and dynamic connectedness between distributed ledger technology and sectoral stocks: enhancing the supply chain and investment decisions with digital platforms	Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is highly applicable in various fields, especially the supply chain in many sectors. Against limited empirical evidence, this paper analyzes the relations between the Kensho Distributed Ledger Technology Index and stock indices of 12 sectors, including communication services, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy, health care, financials, industrials, information technology, materials, utilities, and real estate, and ESG by employing the quantile coherency and dynamic connectedness techniques. Our results reveal that the quantile coherency between the DLT stock index and the sectoral stock indices in almost all cases is significant and positive. The positive co-movement tends to be stronger in the longer terms and as we move from the lower to the higher quantiles, implying that they are more strongly connected in the long term and during the bearish market condition. Moreover, the dynamic connectedness indicates that the DLT stocks and the sectoral stocks are highly connected, with the former being a net transmitter of spillover shocks. The spillovers are also time-varying, and the results significantly corroborate those of the quantiles coherency methods. Among other relevant implications, DLT can be an important factor in the development and enhancement of these sectors.	distributed ledger technology;supply chain;quantile coherency;dynamic connectednessimpulse-response analysis;blockchain technology;financial sector;health-care;uncertainty;spillovers

391	实体经济	PAA: A Blockchain-Based Parking Assistance Alliance With User Preference	In order to improve traffic conditions and environmental pollution caused by automobile exhaust, it is critical and challenging to help numerous vehicle users to obtain ideal parking spaces in terms of quality of experience (QoE), security and efficiency. The parking assistance scheme using the consortium blockchain can get a tradeoff between security and efficiency, but it is a key issue to meet the preferences of parking space seekers and design a well-operated incentive sharing mechanism. This paper proposes a Parking Assistance Alliance (PAA) scheme based on double auction for vehicular blockchain. Through truthful incentives, the PAA encourages vehicles in the alliance to provide parking information for nearby vehicle users. Further, the vehicle user's preference is fully considered when assigning the parking space. The matching priority is introduced by incorporating the parking space supply and demand, as a reference to provide prioritized service. Theoretical proofs and simulation results show that the PAA scheme can achieve individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness, with high user satisfaction, and the PAA scheme deployed on the IBM Hyperledger Fabric platform outperforms the existing method with an average of 7.42% higher successful allocation ratio and 35.4% less transaction confirmation time.	blockchains;space vehicles;privacy;edge computing;sun;smart contracts;resource management;parking assistance;blockchain;double auction;resource allocation;preference;vehicle fog computing

394	实体经济	Service-Oriented Modeling for Blockchain-Enabled Supply Chain Quality Information Systems	Quality management is one of the most critical issues in supply chain management. The rapid growth of information technologies, such as blockchain technology, has facilitated effective information systems development to support supply chain quality management. However, a significant challenge in developing blockchain-enabled supply chain quality information systems is how to deal with information asymmetry and the conflicting interests of supply chain partners. Taking a service-dominant view, this research proposes a Blockchain-Oriented Service Modeling (BOSM) approach for blockchain-enabled supply chain quality information systems. We provide a visual language for modeling the coordination and integration of business processes and domain knowledge at the knowledge level to facilitate the alignment of blockchain technology with supply chain quality management. The proposed approach bridges operational service computing with strategic service management in blockchain-enabled supply chain quality management and facilitates the communication between business people in supply chain management and software professionals in blockchain-based service computing. A case study on a dairy supply chain is presented to show advantages of the modeling framework under the service-dominant view, separating the cause of quality from the carrier of quality in the design of blockchain-enabled supply chain quality information systems.	management;technology;improvement;challenges;inspection;framework

Sustainable consumption and production can be achieved with the establishment of resilient infrastructure with innovation. The resilient infrastructure with innovation is realized by the integration of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). With this motivation, this study explored the different studies that implemented these technologies in the fashion industry for smart cloth (health), supply chain, circular economy, dress recommendation system, fashion trend forecasting, health prediction, and virtual and augmented based shopping experience. Along with the progress of these technologies in the fashion industry, the study also discussed limitations and provided recommendations such as wide adoption of blockchain in fashion supply chain; advancement in energy storage for smart cloth; integration of IoT, AI, and edge computing; and smart clothing-based framework for rescue operation for future enhancement.	augmented reality;stretchable electronics;user experience;social media;internet;design;footwear;things
397	实体经济	The blockchain challenge for Sweden's housing and mortgage markets	This paper investigates how blockchain technology may alter the defining mechanisms of residential real estate transactions in Sweden. It departs from the assumption that blockchain applications do not merely change complex socio-economic, organisational and governance arrangements of mature housing and mortgage markets. Rather, they may trigger resistance among incumbents in the current organisational model, which will drive incremental change. This analysis shows that housing transactions in Sweden are long and complex endeavours, underpinned by exclusivity, uncertainty and information inequalities. A public-private consortium led by Lantmateriet - a Swedish government agency - has pioneered the use of blockchain technology for the conveyance of a house to address these deficiencies. This project has not moved beyond the proof-of-concept phase, while the socio-technical organisation of transactions has evolved. Insights from institutional and evolutionary approaches help conceptualise how technologically induced and qualitatively different structures and functional effects may change the way housing and mortgage markets will work, thereby highlighting both disruptive potentialities and limitations of blockchain applications for the legacy design underpinning the current Swedish housing transaction system. Following a forensic empirical approach, this paper dissects the organisational architecture, key practices and the linked network of actor groups running Sweden's property and mortgage markets. Results illustrate that understanding concrete blockchain-induced changes and their unintended consequences requires closer scholarly attention at the scale of actor networks, the types of knowledge and technologies, and the micro-geographies in which they are embedded. Such in-depth understanding enables better-informed assessments of the blockchain challenge for complex housing and mortgage markets.	transitions;systems
398	实体经济	A Two-Stage SEM-Artificial Neural Network Analysis of Integrating Ethical and Quality Requirements in Accounting Digital Technologies	Digital technologies affect all areas and activities of society. Accounting is no exception to this trend, as organizational information system accounting increasingly integrates digital technologies. The paper aims to study the integration of ethical requirements with the quality requirements in implementing digital technologies based on artificial intelligence, blockchain, the internet of things, and cloud computing in financial and managerial accounting. This empirical study of 396 accountants from Romanian organizations involves investigating the influence of ethical and quality requirements of digital technologies on the perception of users' satisfaction in financial and managerial accounting. Empirical research encompasses a quantitative approach using structural equation modeling and artificial neural network analysis in a two-stage procedure. Some of the existing ethical issues can be addressed by implementing new digital technologies but implementing these emerging technologies can generate other ethical and quality issues that accounting and IT professionals must address in a combined effort. The research results show that the ethical requirements that influence the perception of financial and managerial accounting are security and trust. Among the quality requirements, the most critical influence in the perception of accountants is reliability.	ethical requirements;quality requirements;digital technologies;managerial accounting;iot;artificial intelligenceblockchain;digitization;intelligence;prediction;adoption;systems
399	协同技术	Application of Edge Computing in Physical Education Teaching Management	In the traditional teaching mode, teachers have limited time and energy, but the emergence of AI technology-assisted teaching has greatly facilitated students and teachers. They can study and teach anytime and anywhere and can also solve the problem of lack of professional teachers or venues. With the continuous popularization of "Internet + education" technology, the teaching mode has changed, and online courses are gradually accepted by students regardless of time and geographical constraints. This article aims to study the optimization and application of the intelligent scheduling algorithm in the physical education management system based on blockchain technology. This article proposes a combination of Edge Computing technology and intelligent algorithm software and hardware to improve the current difficulties of domestic colleges and universities. The core content of integration, system functions, course scheduling algorithm, database, and other core contents are preliminary designed, hoping to provide ideas for the specific implementation of the college course scheduling system. The experimental results in this paper show that with the support of Edge Computing in solving the CSP problem, the efficiency of various algorithms is relatively high and comparable when the filling rate is less than 90%. However, when the filling rate exceeds 90%, the execution time of the IFS CBS algorithm is relatively longer, but it is generally acceptable. The algorithm and optimization strategy are also implemented, and the performance improvement of the algorithm is compared and analyzed through experiments, which proves the feasibility of the optimization strategy.	scheduling algorithm
400	虚拟经济	NFTs and the enclosure of the digital realm	This paper will first describe some of the unique features of blockchain technology and 'smart contracts' used in NFTs. Next, we discuss four ways in which the economic and social potential of NFTs can be derailed, leading to 'digital enclosures' whereby large institutional copyright holders reap most of these benefits for themselves through illegitimate - and sometimes unlawful rent-seeking, as well as the very real potential for fraudulent activities by malicious actors. Finally, we offer some initial suggestions on how to regulate NFTs and blockchain technology to prevent these illegitimate forms of rent-seeking and the 'digital enclosures' to which they give rise. Future governance in this area should be directed toward protecting individual artists, content creators, and small businesses over large institutional copyright holders, as do many current laws and regulations.	non-fungible tokens;tragedy
401	平台项目	AAC-IoT: Attribute Access Control Scheme for IoT Using Lightweight Cryptography and Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain	The Internet of Things (IoT) is an integrated environment as it merges physical smart objects to the Internet via wireless technologies to share data. The global connectivity of IoT devices brings the needs to ensure security and privacy for data owners and data users. In this paper, an attribute-based access control scheme for IoT (AAC-IoT) using Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain is proposed to address the security challenges. In the AAC-IoT scheme, data owners are registered and authenticated using identities, certificates and signatures. Data users, however, are registered with identities, certificates, signatures and physical unclonable function (PUF); then a credence score is computed for users to predict the originality during authentication. For access control, attribute-based access control (ABAC) is used, and the number of attributes is selected based on the sensitivity of the data. In accordance with the attributes count, the access control policies are generated. The novel concept of attribute count is determined from a fuzzy logic method using data type and preference. Hyperledger Fabric (HLB) blockchain is presented to manage meta-data and security credentials from data owners and data users, respectively, using a lightweight hashing algorithm. The AAC-IoT model using HLF blockchain is developed with Java programming language and iFogSim simulator. The performance metrics are measured based on latency, throughput and storage overhead, and the results show better outcome than the previous research work.	attribute based access control;authentication;hyperledger fabric;blockchain;internet of thingssecurity;internet
402	实体经济	A blockchain-based dynamic and traceable data integrity verification scheme for smart homes	A smart home system composed of numerous smart devices has benefited people's life due to the feature of convenience. With the development of smart home technology, huge amounts of data stored on external servers flow between different smart devices, and the integrity of these data is of great importance to the security of smart home systems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based data integrity verification scheme that supports efficient dynamic operations for a smart home system. In the verification scheme, we utilize the home gateway (HG) to aggregate all the data information and design a data structure that can be efficiently and dynamically operated to store the tag information of the data, which can reduce the local storage pressure in smart home systems. Moreover, homomorphic verifiable tags are used to formulate verification strategies and record the interactions between HG, cloud service providers (CSP), and third-party auditor (TPA) on the blockchain to make the verification service traceable and useful. Then, the theoretical analysis and experiments prove that the scheme is effective and cost-acceptable in smart home systems.	data integrity;blockchain;smart home system;dynamic operation;samplingiot;challenges;internet
403	实体经济	Competition versus cooperation? Which is better in a remanufacturing supply chain considering blockchain	Remanufacturers often sell remanufactured products via their own channels (i.e., competition mode) or manufacturers' channels with brand advantage (i.e., cooperation mode). Besides, blockchain improves consumers' perceived quality of remanufactured products by alleviating their concerns. We develop game models by considering the influences of brand advantage and blockchain. Findings show that the brand advantage has critical effects on the manufacturer's mode selection except for the remanufacturer, but blockchain influences both of their selections. Moreover, the remanufacturer may choose either cooperation or competition when the patent license fee is exogenous, but will only choose cooperation when the patent license fee is endogenous.	remanufacturing supply chain;mode selection;patent license fee;brand advantage;blockchainoperations;strategy;design;market;tax
404	协同技术	Blockchain data privacy protection modeling based on CP-ABE algorithm	With the proposal of the concept of ubiquitous power Internet of Things and the further promotion of blockchain strategy, modern information technologies such as the Internet of Things and cloud computing have been widely used in the power system. While the power grid is becoming more intelligent, it is also accompanied by the emergence of various security threats, and the power grid will face greater challenges and pressures. In this paper, aiming at the current situation of information security faced by the power grid blockchain under the cloud Internet of Things, a multi-authorization center ciphertext policy attribute encryption access control method is constructed for the power grid blockchain. It adds the function of visitor attribute update revocation, aggregates multi-dimensional data into ciphertext, and uses CP-ABE encryption to implement fine-grained access control at the dimension level. Through experimental analysis, in terms of security and functionality, this method can resist physical collision attacks and manage access rights flexibly. In terms of encryption and decryption efficiency, the encryption and decryption calculation speed of the proposed method is 6.2-15.6% higher than that of the traditional method, and the time consumption efficiency is more than 5% higher than that of other methods. It proves that this model has more advantages for open network environments such as power grid blockchain with high confidentiality requirements and large scale of users. It is of great significance to study the data security and privacy protection methods of the power grid blockchain.	blockchain;encryption algorithm;internet of things;power system;private data;security modelsmart;scheme;authentication;preservation;aggregation;challenges;internet;things
405	实体经济	Blockchain technology applications in the health domain: a multivocal literature review	Blockchain technology has been changing the nature of several businesses, from supply chain management to electronic record management systems and copyright management to healthcare applications. It provides a resilient and secure platform for modifications due to its distributed and shared nature and cryptographic functions. Each new technology, however, comes with its challenges alongside its opportunities. Previously, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore how blockchain technology potentially benefits health domain applications. The previous SLR included 27 formal literature papers from 2016 to 2020. Noticing that blockchain technology is rapidly growing, we extended the previous SLR with a multivocal literature review (MLR) approach to present the state of the art in this study. We focused on understanding to what degree blockchain could answer the challenges inherited in the health domain and whether blockchain technology may bring new challenges to health applications. The MLR consists of 78 sources of formal literature and 23 sources of gray literature from 2016 to 2021. As a result of this study, we specified 17 health domain challenges that can be categorized into four groups: (i) meeting regulatory requirements and public health surveillance, (ii) ensuring security and privacy, (iii) ensuring interoperability, and (iv) preventing waste of resources. The analysis shows that blockchain makes significant contributions to the solutions of these challenges. However, 10 new pitfalls come with adopting the technology in the health domain: the inability to delete sensitive data once it is added to a chain, limited ability to keep large-scale data in a blockchain, and performance issues. The data we extracted during the MLR is available in a publicly accessible online repository.	blockchain;health domain challenges;software development;multivocal literature review;formal literature;gray literaturecare;management;exchange
406	实体经济	ESDedup: An efficient and secure deduplication scheme based on data similarity and blockchain for cloud-assisted medical storage systems	With the explosive growth of medical data, the tendency to store medical data on cloud is extremely widespread. However, large-scale medical data have put great pressure on cloud storage systems since redundancy of data wastes much storage space and increases economic expense. Besides, security is also highly important for medical data stored in the cloud. In order to reduce redundancy and ensure security of medical data simultaneously, this study proposes an efficient and secure deduplication scheme ESDedup. Compared with existing works, the redundancy of medical data is summarized and denoising of deduplication is firstly presented to decrease the storage overhead. Afterward, the rewriting algorithm based on similarity instead of the time attribute eliminates more fragments. Meanwhile, the auditing strategy of blockchain is designed to promote the auditing efficiency and security. Experiments demonstrate that ESDedup not only promotes the scalability and system performance, but also improves the deduplication ratio by 55.9% compared with the state-of-the-art method.	redundancy;deduplication;data similarity;blockchain;storage systemscontent-defined-chunking;performance;restore
407	实体经济	Blockchain for applications of clinical trials: Taxonomy, challenges, and future directions	Patient enrollment, data sharing, and data privacy are enormous medical challenges for clinical trial studies. In recent years, blockchain technology has drawn the attention of various researchers and institutes. As a new and innovative distributed ledger technology, blockchain can be critical to addressing these challenges, thus making clinical research transparent and building public trust fairly and openly. However, the existing literature lacks a comprehensive survey on the adoption of blockchain in clinical trials. To fill the research void, this paper presents a punctilious taxonomy of blockchain technology in clinical trials according to the literature. This taxonomy comprises decentralized scenarios, decentralized practices, blockchain types, deployment methods, and consensus algorithms. The results show that blockchain technology can cover all aspects of the clinical trial study in a decentralized, secure, transparent manner. Besides, some open research challenges of blockchain are categorized into three groups: technical challenges, security challenges, and organizational challenges. Moreover, some recent blockchain projects, micro applications in clinical trials, and several research areas or technologies for future research and development are discussed.	model;technology;consent;time;care
408	实体经济	ShareChain: Blockchain-enabled model for sharing patient data using federated learning and differential privacy	Every individual in our technologically evolved world needs proper data security. The procedure of exchanging medical information is increasingly concerned with data privacy. Many techniques have been offered for preserving data security. These techniques use approaches such as k$$ k $$-anonymity, l$$ l $$-diversity, and others. However, such solutions are vulnerable to attribute disclosure, homogeneity, and background knowledge risks due to their syntactic nature. In this work, we describe a safe and secure architecture and semantic approach for data sharing that is based on blockchain, local differential privacy (LDP), and federated learning (FL). The proposed framework generates an atmosphere devoid of trust in which data owners are no longer required to have trust in the controllers. The FL models enable the whole network to decentralize its data-driven learning. Interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to provide data security in a distributed environment because each file in IPFS has a digital fingerprint that is computed using a cryptographic hash function on the file's whole contents. Due to the rigorous privacy guarantee, data owners no longer need to be worried about the security of their data. The proposed model's assessment parameters include latency, throughput, privacy, and accuracy. The data privacy of the proposed model is protected via LDP and FL, and its latency and throughput communication transactions on permissioned blockchain are calculated and compared with those of the benchmark model. The findings indicate that the proposed model delivers 85% more accurate privacy than the benchmark model.	blockchain;federated learning;local differential privacy;privacy protectionpreserving framework;health;secure
409	协同技术	Efficient Blockchain Scheme for IoT Data Storage and Manipulation in Smart City Environment	We describe an implementation of a data storage and manipulation system for the Internet of Things (IoT) networks based on blockchain and using a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-like protocol to achieve consensus. In our proposed model, blockchain ledger consistency is ensured by leaders contending for the next available spot(s) in which the newly accepted blocks will be appended to the blockchain. The contention takes place on a shared overlay accessible to all leaders nodes. We use a multiple-entry PBFT to eliminate the need for a dedicated leader node and the delays involved in changing leaders in different rounds. Our model allowed the multiple leaders to work in parallel to propose blocks using dedicated overlay networks. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed through an analytical model that employs a discrete-time Markov chain and M/G/1 queuing model with exhaustive limited service. The results obtained from the model confirm the efficiency of the proposed model in a wide range of parameter values and show that the proposed model outperforms the multiple entry points of the PBFT protocol with single block insertion.	blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;internet of things;smart cities;green products;delays;scalability;blockchain;internet-of-things;practical byzantine fault tolerance (pbft)research issues;internet
410	协同技术	A decentralized and reliable trust measurement for edge computing enabled Internet of Things	The combination of edge computing (EC) and the Internet of Things is a hot research topic. And security is one of the most important problems to be solved. The trust measurement of devices is an effective way to solve the security problem, and the lack of a unified trust measurement model makes the untrusted devices destroy the quality of service. Establishing a reliable trust relationship between devices can effectively improve the security of the system. A decentralized trust measurement model for devices is proposed. First, a decentralized trust measurement framework is proposed, which combines EC with blockchain technology to establish a decentralized hierarchical structure; second, the credibility of devices is measured from multilevel and multi-attribute; finally, a feedback trust filtering mechanism is designed to filter reliable feedback information, and then the trust between devices and the comprehensive trust of devices are calculated. Experiments and analysis show that the proposed decentralized trust measurement model can effectively measure the trust degree of devices and resist various malicious feedback attacks.	blockchain;edge computing;internet of things;trust measurementmanagement scheme;multisource feedback;mechanism
411	协同技术	A comprehensive analysis of blockchain and its applications in intelligent systems based on IoT, cloud and social media	Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) driven blockchain is currently one of the most promising technology revolutions with enormous potential across a wide range of applications. Distributed ledger is essentially a distributed and encrypted database that can address several concerns pertaining to Internet security and trust with transparency. In fact, the scope of blockchain applications is broadening with each passing day. The exclusive features of safe and transparent data exchange provided by blockchain technology provide compelling arguments for its implementation in a variety of application scenarios. In this paper, we present the comprehensive view of blockchain and its related concepts. Though, there exists intensive research on these domains; however, these fields are still dealing with several security issues, data reliability and storage and scalability. Blockchain has emerged as a critical technology that can address these issues through its features like decentralization, transparency, immutability and auditability. Building trust in distributed systems without the need for authority is a technological advancement that can be well leveraged by domain, like, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and social media. Technologies like IoT and Cloud computing can be perceived as the trivial ones to get benefitted from the blockchain. However, the integration of social media and blockchain can revolutionize the domains, like, content creating and sharing, fake news scourge, trademarking and rights management. In this paper, we illustrate the integration of blockchain with IoT, cloud and social media and the related issues and challenges. Moreover, we also show some of the major research works done in each domain.	blockcahin;cloud;intelligent systems;iot;social medianetwork architecture;smart contracts;fair payment;internet;security;technology;things;challenges;management;framework

413	市场治理	Overcoming the Coordination Problem in New Marketplaces via Cryptographic Tokens	We study the use of platform-specific tradable cryptographic tokens to solve the coordination problem that is common in adopting new marketplaces. We show that certain characteristics of platform-specific tokens-specifically, their tradability, the ability of the platform to commit both to accept and to require these tokens in the future, and the ability to commit to a price and/or quantity schedule-can help overcome the coordination problem and can support equilibria favorable to the new marketplace. Compared with other mechanisms in the literature to address the coordination problem-such as subsidies of early users and promises of refunds or buybacks if the platform fails-platform-specific cryptographic tokens are less likely to favor established or larger firms with established reputations and financial resources. We find that tokens allow a marketplace to trade off future revenue for present revenue, which then can be used to address the coordination problem. On the other hand, the ability to trade out of the platform results in a smaller future network and lower total profit. Thus, if the new marketplace is not facing capital constraints, then the most profitable strategy is the traditional strategy to subsidize adoption. If the new marketplace is capital-constrained, however, as is often the case for new entrants and unproven technology applications, tokens can offer an alternative that is increasingly attractive as the cost of capital increases.	adoption of new marketplaces;economics of is;icos;blockchain;platform adoption;network effectsequilibrium;cooperation;reputation

415	实体经济	Climate-smart agriculture using intelligent techniques, blockchain and Internet of Things: Concepts, challenges, and opportunities	The Internet of Things (IoT) is an important technology that provides efficient and dependable solutions in a variety of domains, such as smart agriculture and climatic change. It integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another and gives solutions to automatically maintain and monitor smart agricultural and environmental fields. The combination of IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology will allow us to transform smart agriculture into the Internet of smart agriculture, providing greater control, management, and security in supply-chain networks. This paper presents an overview of the technologies in the domains of IoT, Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), AI, Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain. In addition, the paper presents several approaches for integrating IoT with CSA data analysis. Both AI and blockchain are adopted for efficient CSA systems. The paper is concerned with the combination of three recent technologies: IoT, ML, and blockchain to serve the CSA applications. The challenges and opportunities of combining these technologies to serve CSA are also discussed in the paper.	system;iot;attack;security
416	核心技术	Blockchain Tree Powered Green Communication for Efficient and Sustainable Connected Autonomous Vehicles	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) is a system of inter-connectivity and communication between smart automated vehicles. Blockchain has emerged as a technology focusing on data security with a decentralized architecture and has been successful to a very high degree. Unfortunately, this technology was not originally meant for low-power IoT devices and is very computationally expensive with high power requirements and a tendency to introduce delays. With the explosion of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled autonomous vehicles, boosted further by the advent of smart cities, energy requirements have become an issue that can no longer be ignored. As a consequence, research into green technologies has been gaining popularity. With this area of focus, blockchain with its exponential power consumption levels is heavily flawed and thus presents itself as a prime candidate for improvement. In this paper, a framework is proposed to further evolve blockchain technology to integrate it with a semi-centralized data storage mechanism, while keeping network control decentralized. The proposed Blockchain Tree (BCT) approach entails a combination of a tree structure network composed of blockchains, based on a time-based upward data propagation mechanism that optimizes the architecture to reduce communication delay, cut down its high power consumption levels and ensure sustainability in the long run. As is evident in the comparative study, such a blockchain-based network structure offers drastic improvements in terms of speed, energy savings, storage and computation. The proposed model reduces the storage requirement of the blockchain by a factor of 0.17. The energy requirements and time complexity have been optimized by approximately 195% in the early stages of optimization. All the parameters get further optimized by orders of magnitude with more transactions and users.	blockchains;internet of things;energy storage;power demand;energy consumption;decision making;autonomous vehicles;blockchain tree;connected autonomous vehicles;green technology;internet of things;smart city;sustainability;energy consumption;storage complexity;time complexityoptimization;system
417	虚拟经济	Application of a distributed verification in Islamic microfinance institutions: a sustainable model	The literature gap in microfinance paradox of double bottom line (financial performance vs. outreach) has always been an interesting area of research. This paper proposes a theoretical model most suitable for Islamic Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) which enables Islamic MFIs' to operate together with the existing financial models compliant with Islamic Shariah Law. This model is based on a distributed verification/decision-making process that might be realized (but not necessary) through blockchain. Among the available distributed verification techniques, blockchain technology is an attractive emerging computing paradigm due to its decentralized, immutable, shared, and secure data structure characteristics. This model proposes three significant propositions. First, sharing information through blockchain will allow a transparent network in MFI operations, which will raise confidence for donors resulting in a causal effect of a relatively lower profit rate to be charged by the MFIs. Second, the consensus mechanism will enable risk-sharing, a character of Islamic finance; thus, the MFIs will operate without any collateral for low-risk firms. Third, the double bottom line of MFIs' long-lasting paradox would be solved. As for practical implication of this proposed model, the causal impact of lower cost investment by the lenders would increase social welfare because of no collateral and no initial wealth requirement. The proposed model proposes a credit rationing approach where profit can be negative. No collateral will be used when calculating the creditworthiness of a borrower.	blockchain;islamic microfinance;double bottom line;distributed verificationcredit markets;blockchain
418	实体经济	An Efficient Identity-Based Aggregate Signcryption Scheme With Blockchain for IoT-Enabled Maritime Transportation System	Maritime transportation has ushered in a period of vigorous development and has been the most critical mode of transport in international trade. Maritime communication is also becoming increasingly complex. This trend needs the IoT-enabled Maritime Transportation System (IMTS) to enhance its ability of privacy-preserving, performance continuously, and add the function of joint management. Although many aggregate signcryption (ASC) schemes have been presented to satisfy this requirement, they still suffer from performance deficiencies or security weaknesses. To address these issues, we design a more practical "Perception-Network-Application" IoT-enabled MTS (PNA-IMTS) network structure. Then, we propose an efficient Identity-based aggregate signcryption scheme with blockchain (B-ID-ASC) for PNA-IMTS based on this network model. The security analysis shows that the B-ID-ASC scheme is capable of providing confidentiality and unforgeability. It also can resist existing known attacks (impersonation attack, modification attack, man-in-the-middle attack). The performance analysis indicates that our B-ID-ASC scheme, having lower computation and communication costs than current ASC schemes, is more applicable for PNA-IMTS.	organizations;blockchains;relays;aggregates;transportation;receivers;wireless sensor networks;imts;pna-imts;blockchain;b-id-asc;confidentiality;unforgeability
419	核心技术	An approach for the automatic verification of blockchain protocols: the Tweetchain case study	This paper proposes a model-driven approach for the security modelling and analysis of blockchain based protocols. The modelling is built upon the definition of a UML profile, which is able to capture transaction-oriented information. The analysis is based on existing formal analysis tools. In particular, the paper considers the Tweetchain protocol, a recent proposal that leverages online social networks, i.e., Twitter, for extending blockchain to domains with small-value transactions, such as IoT. A specialized textual notation is added to the UML profile to capture features of this protocol. Furthermore, a model transformation is defined to generate a Tamarin model, from the UML models, via an intermediate well-known notation, i.e., the Alice &Bob notation. Finally, Tamarin Prover is used to verify the model of the protocol against some security properties. This work extends a previous one, where the Tamarin formal models were generated by hand. A comparison on the analysis results, both under the functional and non-functional aspects, is reported here too.	distributed ledger technology;formal modelling;automatic model generation;vulnerability discovery;formal verification;uml profilesecurity
420	实体经济	Critical success factors of blockchain technology to implement the sustainable supply chain using an extended decision-making approach	Recently, blockchain technology has greatly revolutionized industries by offering a variety of applications in various domains, including finance, healthcare, the food industry, and the supply chain. Blockchain generally refers to a secured, shared, distributed ledger comprising a list of transactions, which is not modifiable without reaching a consensus. Blockchain technology attempts to prepare the stage for smart networks for data mobility, which can remarkably make sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) more productive and transparent. Thus, numerous companies have either already started the implementation of this technology or are currently considering it in order to enhance their business quality. Therefore, in this paper, a new decision framework called the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS)-entropy-rank sum-weighting method (RSWM)-multi-objective optimization with ratio analysis with the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA) is developed. In this approach, the q-ROF-entropy-RSWM is utilized to obtain the subjective and objective weights of critical success factors, and the MULTIMOORA model is used to assess the preferences of manufacturing firms to implement blockchain technology in SSCM. An empirical case study is taken to evaluate the critical success factors of implementing blockchain technology in SSCM. Also, comparison and sensitivity investigation are made to show the superiority of the developed framework.	blockchain technology;sustainable supply chain;q -rung orthopair fuzzy sets;entropy;multimoora;rank -sum weight;multi -criteria decision -makingmanagement-practices;challenges;network;impact;opportunities;traceability;framework;adoption;optimization;multimoora
421	实体经济	Blockchain in sustainable supply chain management: an application of the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) methodology	Purpose The analytical hierarchical process (AHP)'s main purpose is to assess higher hierarchy levels based on the cooperation of its various levels. It results in a well-designed model-based method in which the weights for the selected attribute are calculated using dimensions, criteria, and indicators. This paper aims to highlight the benefits of blockchain in supply chain management with the help of a literature review along with opinions of experts from various sectors. Design/methodology/approach With the goal of enhancing the use of blockchain technology in supply chain management, particularly when comparing within the same industry, the AHP methodology has been used. In order to develop the AHP model, a total of eight elements are examined in this study, which are decentralization, resiliency, security, smart contracts, sustainability, traceability, transparency and trust. A calculation of a Desirability Index for conventional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chains has been also developed. Findings Findings where that in a blockchain-enabled supply chain, the global weights of individual benefit variables are considerably larger than in conventional supply chains. When the score of the Desirability Index for conventional supply chain and blockchain-enabled supply chain is compared, the blockchain-enabled supply chain significantly surpasses the conventional supply chain in terms of increasing sustainable development in today's supply networks. Originality/value This study takes into account the AHP methodology applying it on blockchain. This has not been done before in the academic world, at least as far as the authors may be aware of. The originality of combining such process with a recent technology such as blockchain highlights the value of this research.	blockchain;supply chain management;analytical hierarchical processdecentralized consensus;technology;trust;challenges;adoption;systems;secure;iot

The security of data and information in the digital world has been a challenge to everyone; Blockchain technology has attracted many researchers in these scenarios. This paper focuses on finding the current trends in Blockchain technology to help the researchers select an area to carry future research. The data related to Blockchain Technologies have been collected from IEEE, Springer, ACM, and other digital databases.

423	技术治理	STSIIML: Study on token shuffling under incomplete information based on machine learning	Transaction data on the public chain is open and transparent to all participants, which poses a potential threat to the privacy of participants. Some privacy-conscious token holders want to employ obfuscation methods to protect the origin and destination of their tokens, and the need for token shuffling services (TSS) arose at a historical moment. The prevailing token shuffling policies rely too heavily on blacklists in the token shuffling process, which is contrary to the idea of decentralization. Therefore, weakening or even eliminating the usage of blacklisting mechanisms in TSSs, which is an urgent issue to be addressed. In this paper, we adopt the idea of machine learning and propose a general framework for TSSs, which replaces the natural role under incomplete information with machine learning, so as to achieve the goal of eliminating the blacklist mechanism in TSSs. Then, the token shuffling process is constructed as an extended game under incomplete information on the basis of different token shuffling policies, and this incomplete information game is analyzed on the basis of poison policy, haircut policy, and suicide policy respectively. Finally, the sequential equilibrium under different games is investigated through simulations. The simulation results show that in the incomplete information game based on the poison policy, the participation of two players in the TSS is a sequential equilibrium, while in the incomplete information game based on the haircut policy, the players do not participate in the TSS is an sequential equilibrium.	blockchain;incomplete information game;machine learning;token shuffling servicebitcoin;secure
424	实体经济	An Efficient Blockchain-Based Hierarchical Data Sharing for Healthcare Internet of Things	With the assistance of the Internet of Things, the fast developing Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) has promoted the healthcare ecosystem into the era of Health 5.0 and enables many promising medical applications, such as remote healthcare that is crucial in pandemic (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019). Healthcare participants can make accurate diagnosis, treatment, and research based on the shared personal health records (PHRs) sensed from remote H-IoT devices. However, current H-IoT systems fall short of a secure and trustworthy PHR sharing service in remote healthcare, which is able to prevent user privacy leakage and PHR integrity violation together with high efficiency in key distribution alongside efficient data retrieval and fine-grained access control. In response, we present a blockchain-based hierarchical data sharing framework (BHDSF) to provide fine-grained access control and efficient retrieval over encrypted PHRs with low consumed hierarchical key distribution and key leakage resistance. Compared with the existing solutions, the BHDSF takes both untrusted cloud and malicious auditor into consideration simultaneously and achieves trustworthy PHR integrity auditing and metadata verification by leveraging the blockchain technique. Besides, the BHDSF enables efficiently aggregative authentication for the trustworthiness of source records from H-IoT devices, which is lacked in most of the existing data sharing frameworks. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the BHDSF by conducting extensive empirical tests over a real-world dataset.	medical services;blockchains;internet of things;cloud computing;encryption;access control;bandwidth;aggregative source authentication;attribute-based encryption;healthcare internet of things (h-iot);online;offline encryption;outsourced decryptionattribute-based encryption;industrial internet;keyword search;framework;privacy
425	协同技术	Software-Defined Security-by-Contract for Blockchain-Enabled MUD-Aware Industrial IoT Edge Networks	To ensure the proper functioning and performance of Industrial grade Internet of Things devices (IIoT) in Industry 4.0 networks, it is critical to identify the capabilities and malfunctions of their component devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, and controllers) and detect potential misbehavior arising due to cyber-attacks, and misconfiguration. We envision future IoT devices embed behavioral profiles through Security-by-Contract (SxC) that are easy to validate and verify against network security policies; manufacturers to provide manufacturer usage description (MUD) profiles as a manifest for the devices to signal to the network what sort of access and network functionality they require to properly function. We design authentication in the IoT onboarding process, employ blockchains to a verifiable and immutable repository to store this network manifests, that is signed and verifiable with SxC based smart contracts by the device manufacturer, or industry authority. The integrated framework combines blockchains and SxC security contracts, MUD-based behavioral fingerprinting, and software-defined-networking for managing the security of IIoT ecosystems. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated in a simulated IoT environment on various performance parameters.	multiuser detection;security;industrial internet of things;blockchain;performance evaluation;smart contracts;industries;behavioral compliance;blockchain;industrial internet of things (iiot);network security;software-defined-networking (sdn)internet;things
426	协同技术	A Time-Sensitive Token-Based Anonymous Authentication and Dynamic Group Key Agreement Scheme for Industry 5.0	In Industry 5.0, the massive number of Internet of Things devices have increasing demands for group communication with a high communication efficiency and low energy consumption. However, group communication meets continuously increasing security risk challenges. Existing authentication and group key agreement schemes have encountered many problems, such as lack of anonymity and untraceability. In this article, we propose an anonymous authentication and dynamic group key agreement scheme based on the Blockchain and token mechanism, where each group member can apply for a time-sensitive token during the first authentication and only needs to check the validity of the token in the subsequent authentication, reducing the computational and transmission costs considerably. The verification on the security of the proposed scheme is tackled through mathematical analysis and validated using ProVerif, and comparisons with existing schemes demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the security risks and each group member's energy consumption.	authentication;industries;security;internet of things;blockchains;costs;informatics;anonymous authentication;blockchain;cryptography;group key agreement;industry 5;0protocol
427	实体经济	Blockchain Protocol-Based Predictive Secure Control for Networked Systems	Networked control systems (NCSs) are widely used in practical applications because of their flexibility in deployment. However, due to the dependence on the communication network, NCSs could be vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks. To address this problem, a novel blockchain technology-assisted networked predictive secure control approach is presented for the first time in this article. First, the introduction of blockchain technology brings a significant boost to the inherent resilience of the NCS in an active manner without relying on any prior knowledge of the system or potential attacks. However, blockchain technology would induce time delays unfavorable to the NCS, which could result in the low real-time performance of the control system. Subsequently, a networked Kalman filter-based predictive control is specially designed to compensate for the low real-time property of blockchain technology. A detailed analysis of the security and stability of the closed-loop NCS with the developed networked predictive secure controller is also presented, while sufficient conditions for the closed-loop system to be simultaneously stable and safe in a probabilistic sense are given. Finally, to verify the performance of the proposed approach in terms of practicality, an experimental prototype of a photovoltaic (PV)-based power generation system subjected to random cyber-attacks is built for voltage regulation.	blockchains;security;distributed ledger;real-time systems;stability analysis;peer-to-peer computing;resistance;blockchain protocol;cyberattacks;networked predictive control;networked secure control;stabilitydata injection attacks;design

429	市场治理	Time-frequency analysis of financial stress and global commodities prices: Insights from wavelet-based approaches	We examine the time-frequency lead-lag relationships and the degree of integration between the US financial stress index and global commodity prices (i.e., oil, gold, silver, and cocoa) with data covering over 47 decades (January 1975 to December 2021). For this purpose, we resort to the bi- and multiple wavelet econometric approaches. Findings from the bivariate wavelet analysis evidence the significant influence of the US financial stress in driving the price-generating process in commodities markets. Our findings support the hedging abilities of commodities across the time-frequency space. Findings from the multiple correlations explicate that the interrelation between the commodities and financial stress is attributable to their interdependence in the long term during financial market meltdowns. The dynamic and nonhomogeneous lead/lag relations underscored by our findings highlight the importance of cross-commodity investments. As such, by acknowledging the response of different commodities to financial stress, asset allocation should factor in commodities that offer opposing responses to a financial stress to hedge downside risks associated with portfolios. Our findings are of interest to regulators, risk managers, investors, and commodities producers.	financial stress;global commodities prices;commodity financialisation;bivariate wavelet;wavelet multiple correlations;interdependenceoil price;economic-activity;7 centuries;market;us;causality;contagion;dynamics;futures;bitcoin
430	市场治理	The role of cryptocurrency in the dynamics of blockchain-based social networks: The case of Steemit	A shift of paradigm is running over online social platforms: the over-centralization of these platforms is leaving room for decentralized solutions based on blockchain technologies, such as blockchain-based online social networks-BOSNs. Among the many unknown aspects of these techno-social systems, the objective of this study is to propose an analytical framework to assess the impact of the cryptocurrencies linked to a BOSN platform on the evolution of its social network and on the behavior of their users, in terms of production of content and/or its promotion through a voting and rewarding system. The framework has been applied to Steemit, one of the most widespread BOSNs, from which we collected three-year-long high-resolution data on its evolution along with the price of its main cryptocurrencies. On users' activities extracted from these longitudinal data, we applied a time-series correlation analysis and a correlation analysis between the action allocation strategies and the obtained rewards, in the case of most central accounts. The analysis has highlighted pieces of evidence of the influence of the cryptocurrency price on users' actions, particularly on actions that shape the structure of the social networks. Second, we also found highly rewarded users prefer actions related to the promotion of content rather than the creation of high-quality content, exploiting the reward distribution mechanisms implemented by the platform. These findings highlight that the shift of paradigm towards blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies might strengthen the influence of financial and economic factors rather than relational/social aspects on the evolution of these new complex techno-social systems.	
431	市场治理	A generalised seasonality test and applications for cryptocurrency and stock market seasonality	This study develops a novel generalised seasonality test that utilises sequential dummy variable regressions for seasonality periodicity equal to prime numbers. It allows to test for existence of any seasonal patterns against the broad null hypothesis of no seasonality and to isolate most prominent seasonal cycles while using harmonic mean p-values to control for multiple testing. The proposed test has numerous applications in time series analysis. As an example, it is applied to identify seasonal patterns in 76 national stock markets and 772 cryptocurrency markets to detect trading cycles, determine their length, and test the weak-form efficient market hypothesis. Cryptocurrency markets are shown to be less efficient than national stock markets, with predominantly irregular seasonality periodicity that cannot be reduced to conventional weekly, monthly, or annual cycles.(c) 2022 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

432	实体经济	Effective Consensus-Based Distributed Auction Scheme for Secure Data Sharing in Internet of Things	In a traditional electronic auction, the centralized auctioneer and decentralized bidders are in an asymmetric structure, where the auctioneer has more ability to decide the auction result. This asymmetric auction structure is not fair to the participants and not suitable for data auctions in the Internet of Things (IoT). The blockchain-based auction system, with participant equality and fairness, is typically symmetrical and particularly suitable for IoT data sharing. However, when applied to IoT data sharing in reality, it faces privacy and efficiency problems. In this context, how to guarantee privacy and break the inherent performance bottleneck of blockchain is still a major challenge. In this paper, a consensus-based distributed auction scheme is proposed for data sharing, which enforces privacy preservation and collusion resistance. A reverse auction-based decentralized data trading model is introduced to solve the trust problem without a centralized auctioneer, where bidders reach consensus on the auction result. Specifically, we devise a differentially private auction mechanism to incentivize data owners to participate in data sharing. An effective hybrid consensus algorithm is constructed among bidders to reach consensus on the auction result with improved security and efficiency. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed scheme ensures the properties of privacy preservation, incentive compatibility and collusion resistance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed mechanism guarantees the data sharing efficiency and has certain scalability.	distributed auction system;consensus mechanism;privacy preservation;data sharing;internet of thingsblockchain;fair
433	核心技术	A recursive reinforced blockchain performance evaluation and improvement architecture: Maximising diversity to improve scalability	Nowadays, Blockchain technology has received widespread attention because of its ability to effectively solve the trust problem in transactions. However, the throughput of crypto currency using Blockchain technology has never been comparable to that of centralized payment institutions. The fundamental reason is the architecture of the Blockchain itself, and the existing methods often focus on the part of the Blockchain but lack the overall control. In this paper, we design, a novel Recursively Reinforced Blockchain Architecture Search (BORAS) architecture, from the perspective of the overall structure of the Blockchain, which can search the various attributes of the various levels in a adaptive manner, aiming at selecting the best configuration in a dynamical environment. First, we introduce a recursive and scalable reinforcement learning framework, to find the optimal block size and block interval of the Blockchain, so as to improve the throughput of the Blockchain system. Second, we add the selection scheme of consensus algorithm to the dynamic space and also use the framework to select the optimal consensus mechanism to realize the optimal configuration of the Blockchain system in the dynamic environment. Third, we adopt a recursive method, which greatly reduces the time complexity required for the optimal configuration of the Blockchain system and improves the configuration efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on three representative Blockchain platforms demonstrate that BOBAS can consistently improve the throughput, while also reducing latency, with remarkable and efficient performances.	blockchain;recursive optimization;reinforcement learninginternet;technology;systems;things
434	实体经济	Blockchain Applications in Agriculture: A Scoping Review	Blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger technology initially developed to secure cryptocurrency transactions. Following its revolutionary use in cryptocurrencies, blockchain solutions are now being proposed to address various problems in different domains, and it is currently one of the most "disruptive" technologies. This paper presents a scoping review of the scientific literature for exploring the current research area of blockchain applications in the agricultural sector. The aim is to identify the service areas of agriculture where blockchain is used, the blockchain technology used, the data stored in it, its combination with external databases, the reason it is used, and the variety of agricultural products, as well as the level of maturity of the respective approaches. The study follows the PRISMA-ScR methodology. The purpose of conducting these scoping reviews is to identify the evidence in this field and clarify the key concepts. The literature search was conducted in April 2021 using Scopus and Google Scholar, and a systematic selection process identified 104 research articles for detailed study. Our findings show that in the field, although still in the early stages, with the majority of the studies in the design phase, several experiments have been conducted, so a significant percentage of the work is in the implementation or piloting phase. Finally, our research shows that the use of blockchain in this domain mainly concerns the integrity of agricultural production records, the monitoring of production steps, and the monitoring of products. However, other varied and remarkable blockchain applications include incentive mechanisms, a circular economy, data privacy, product certification, and reputation systems. This study is the first scoping review in this area, following a formal systematic literature review methodology and answering research questions that have not yet been addressed.	blockchain;distributed ledger technology;agriculture;scoping review;prisma-scrfood-supply chain;traceability system;safety;technology;management;framework;internet;iot
435	实体经济	Evaluating the opportunities, challenges and risks of applying the blockchain technology in tourism: a Delphi study approach	Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically evaluate the potential of the blockchain technology in tourism. The blockchain technology (BCT) holds potential to contribute significantly to tourism policy and practice. Academic interest in the BCT is rapidly growing with studies looking at the opportunities and challenges of its application. The shortcoming of research on the BCT in tourism has however been in its conceptual nature. The lack of empirical investigations hinders an understanding of how the BCT can be more broadly adopted in tourism, especially from the viewpoint of minimizing its risks. Design/methodology/approach The initial screening of the opportunities, challenges and risks is undertaken via a systematic literature review. The Delphi study is subsequently applied to empirically confirm what opportunities, challenges and risks can be attributed to the BCT use in tourism. Twelve industry and academic experts have contributed to the Delphi study. Findings The risks identified have been categorized as societal, technical, financial and legal. Propositions have been made on how these risks can, at least partially, be overcome. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, it is the first known attempt to study the BCT from the perspective of academic and industry experts. This research is also one of the first to evaluate the risks of the BCT use in tourism. Most risks are identified as not critical and can be addressed as the BCT develops.	blockchain technology;distributed ledger;cryptocurrencies;delphi;blockchain-based tourism;???????????????????????????????
436	实体经济	MPoR: A Modified Consensus for Blockchain-Based Internet of Vehicles	Ride-sharing services, such as ride-hailing and carpooling, have become attractive travel patterns for worldwide users. Due to the high dynamic topology, heterogeneous wireless communication mode, and centralization, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is much more vulnerable to security issues such as privacy theft, single point of failure, data island, and unauthorized access, resulting in great security risks, while ride-sharing services provide convenience. Blockchain technology used to solve the security problems of the IoV has become a current research hotspot, including authentication and privacy protection. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms still face challenges such as large amount of computation, low throughput, low scalability, consensus, and node security. Achieving an efficient, lightweight, and scalable secure blockchain-based IoV system still needs to be solved urgently. In this paper, we propose an effective consensus algorithm called Modified Proof of Reputation (MPoR). Firstly, by using the average network access time of the whole network nodes as the filtering threshold, the number of consensus nodes can be controlled adaptively. Then, a new multiweight reputation algorithm is proposed to quantify the reputation value of nodes, so as to detect and eliminate malicious nodes in the consensus node pool. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulation experiments reflect that under the IoV scenario, MPoR can adaptively select the number of consensus nodes, to effectively improve the consensus efficiency. When malicious nodes are less than 1/3 of the total nodes in the network, MPoR can effectively resist latent attack and collusive attack and has strong robustness.	secure

438	核心技术	Improvement of Delegated Proof of Stake Consensus Mechanism Based on Vague Set and Node Impact Factor	The Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism uses the power of stakeholders to not only vote in a fair and democratic way to solve a consensus problem, but also reduce resource waste to a certain extent. However, the fixed number of member nodes and single voting type will affect the security of the whole system. In order to reduce the negative impact of the above problems, a new consensus algorithm based on vague set and node impact factors is proposed. We first use fuzzy values to calculate the ratings of all nodes and initially determine the number of agent nodes according to the preset threshold value. Then, we judge whether a secondary screening is needed. If needed, calculating the nodes' impact factor based on their neighboring nodes, and combining their impact factors with adjacency votes to further distinguish the nodes with the same fuzzy value. In addition, we analyze the dynamic changes in the composition and scale of the agent node set and give its ideal size through testing. Finally, we compare the proposed algorithm with DPoS algorithm and existing fuzzy set-based algorithms in different scales and network structures. Results show that no matter in what kind of network structures, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is improved. Among which, the most noticeable improvement is seen in complex network structures.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;dpos;vague set;fuzzy value;impact factor

440	实体经济	Fog Computing and Blockchain-Based Security Service Architecture for 5G Industrial IoT-Enabled Cloud Manufacturing	Recent evolution of the industrial Internet of Things empowers the classical manufacturing model with cloud computing integration for Industry 4.0. Cloud integration advances the capabilities of manufacturing systems with cloud-based controlling and real-time process monitoring, which is renowned as cloud manufacturing (CM). However, cloud integration exposes the entire manufacturing ecosystem to a new set of security risks and increments in end-to-end latency. Moving security services toward the edge eradicates message routing latency toward the cloud and eliminates the central point of failure while leveraging the entire system's performance. We propose a blockchain and fog-computing-enabled security service architecture that operates on fog nodes at the edge of manufacturing equipment clusters. The proposed service facilitates CM equipment authentication and equipment-cloud channel privacy protection while preserving anonymity and unlinkability over the blockchain. We implemented the proposed architecture with hyperledger fabric and compared the performance advantage over the state-of-the-art solutions.	manufacturing;security;cloud computing;blockchains;elliptic curves;industrial internet of things;computer architecture;5g;blockchain;cloud manufacturing (cm);fog computing;hyperledger;internet of things (iot);security;smart contracts
441	核心技术	Implementation of a Secure Storage Using Blockchain for PCA-FRF Sensor Data of Plate-Like Structures	Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems have widely been used to guarantee the safe functioning of electrical, mechanical, civil, and aerospace engineering assets. It is required to improve the SHM systems from different aspects in terms of smartification, performance, beneficiation, sustainment, automation, cost-effectivity, and safety using cutting-edge technologies. Blockchain is currently the most revolutionary technology in computer science. Implementation of Blockchain in different fields of academia and industry has recently given very good results. However, application of Blockchain in SHM is still in the infancy stage. Therefore, many challenges are still ahead. One of the main potential applications of Blockchain is to secure the sensor data. In this study, a local Blockchain approach is developed as a secure storage using the extracted Principal Components (PCs) of Frequency Response Function (FRF) data obtained from modal analysis of a plate-like structure. In general, Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is one of the most practical hash functions with efficient performance which has been employed in Bitcoin. Therefore, in this research, SHA-256 is considered to generate the hash for each block. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a secure storage for SHM data using Blockchain.	blockchains;data mining;fourth industrial revolution;big data;storage management;vibration measurement;data security;frequency response;principal component analysis;biomedical monitoring;medical services;blockchain;data security;frequency response function;industry 40;modal analysis;principal component analysis;structural health monitoring;big dataprincipal component analysis;damage identification;impact device;enhancement;energy;classification;wind
442	实体经济	A Privacy-Preserving Distributed Control Strategy in Islanded AC Microgrids	As an effective method to improve the reliability, the advanced communication infrastructure also exposes the islanded AC microgrid (MG) to potential privacy threats. Although the existing differential-privacy based secondary controls provide the privacy protection through adding noise, the noise would bring about large harmonic components thereby degrading the power quality. To tackle with this problem, a novel integrated privacy-preserving distributed fixed-time (PDF) secondary control of the islanded AC MG is proposed for the accurate frequency restoration and active power sharing. The state decomposition strategy and the additional virtual proportional (AVP) coefficient are innovatively designed to achieve the privacy preservation, where the active power ratio of each DG is decomposed into several sub-states. The integrated PDF secondary control only requires each DG to transmit the first sub-state of active power ratio through communication network, which would not increase the communication burden. The designed privacy-preserving mechanism can protect the initial value and real-time running values simultaneously when the AVP coefficient is not disclosed to the external eavesdropper. The real-time simulations based on the NI-PXI real-time simulator are conducted to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the integrated PDF secondary control.	privacy;real-time systems;frequency control;power quality;graph theory;convergence;consensus algorithm;privacy-preserving;distributed control;islanded ac mg;state decompositionsystems;frequency;scheme;authentication;networks;design;secure
443	实体经济	Enabling Energy Trading in Cooperative Microgrids: A Scalable Blockchain-Based Approach With Redundant Data Exchange	Blockchain has recently been regarded as an important enabler for building secure energy trading in microgrid systems because of its inherent features of distributively providing immutable data record, storage, and sharing across networks in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner. However, designing highly efficient and scalable blockchain-enabled energy trading mechanisms is extremely challenging because of the unique features of microgrid systems, e.g., bandwidth-constrained and high-latency communications and large-scale renewable energy source (RES) integration. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose a novel scalable blockchain-based energy trading framework for cooperative microgrid systems, which include four planes, i.e., data plane, consensus plane, smart plane, and application plane. Different from the existing solutions without consideration of network transmission, these four planes are designed with the capability of perceiving the status of block generation and transmission over interrupted P2P networks, and thus proactively improving the consensus process to guarantee the reliability of energy trading in cooperative microgrids. Meanwhile, built on this framework, a novel redundant data exchange strategy is proposed to improve the scalability of block creation with the presence of large-scale RES penetration and interrupted and dynamic communication links. Simulation results show that the proposed system framework outperforms the benchmark blockchain solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the potential applications of the proposed solutions in the practical microgrid systems to facilitate a clear understanding of the mechanisms of the proposed solutions.	microgrids;blockchains;renewable energy sources;informatics;power markets;peer-to-peer computing;delays;blockchain;energy trading;microgrid;redundant data exchange
444	平台项目	A Blockchain-Enabled Demand Management and Control Framework Driven by Deep Reinforcement Learning	The rapid development of Internet-of-Things in smart grid has enabled millions of grid-connected distributed controllable resources (DCR; e.g., electric vehicles, controllable loads) to provide service to the grid, such as frequency regulation and demand response. The integration of these DCRs may become a large virtual power plant network with various characteristics. This poses great challenges from both control and management perspectives, e.g., computation/communication burden, optimization complexity, scalability limitation, prosumer privacy, etc. In this article, we propose an effective autonomous incentive-based DCR control and management framework to integrate a large amount of DCRs to provide grid services, which simultaneously provides accurate active power adjustment to the grid, optimizes DCR allocations, and maximizes the profits for all prosumers and system operators. A model-free deep deterministic policy gradient-based method is designed to find the optimal incentives in a continuous action space to encourage prosumers to adjust their power consumptions. The method is implemented in a consortium open-source blockchain platform, Hyperledger Fabric, which facilitates controls and transaction management. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework, extensive experimental studies are conducted using real-world data.	blockchains;resource management;costs;batteries;fabrics;distributed ledger;reliability;blockchain;deep reinforcement learning;energy storage;renewable energy;virtual power plantbattery storage

446	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based Framework to Enhance Anonymous Services with Accountability Guarantees	Anonymous service delivery has attracted the interest of research and the industry for many decades. To obtain effective solutions, anonymity should be guaranteed against the service provider itself. However, if the full anonymity of users is implemented, no accountability mechanism can be provided. This represents a problem, especially when referring to scenarios in which a user, protected by anonymity, may perform illegally when leveraging the anonymous service. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution to the trade-off between anonymity and accountability. In particular, our solution relies on three independent parties (one of which is the service provider itself) such that only the collaboration of all three actors allows for the disclosure of the real identity of the user. In all other cases, anonymity is guaranteed. To show the feasibility of the proposal, we developed a prototype with user-friendly interfaces that minimize the client-side operations. Our solution is then also effective from the point of view of usability.	ethereum;anonymity;accountability;smart contractsauthentication

However, IoT devices operate in infrastructure-less environments, and hence data security and privacy is always a concern. Counterfeit IoT devices create huge menace in sensitive applications. Moreover, conventional healthcare systems are not patient-centric in the sense that they do not include patient's emotions during treatments. EI helps the clinicians better understand and mange medical procedures. This paper presents a human-centered approach in healthcare domain by the integration of emotional intelligence (EI) and sensor network built around IoT devices. A Raspberry Pi connected with sensors and a camera acts as an IoT device. These sensors collect body vital parameters and Facial expression recognition (FER) based EI. The system is hosted on an Ethereum permissioned blockchain for reliability, security and tamper-proof data sharing and storage. Devices in the network are authenticated using physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Comparative analysis confirms that the PUF-based authentication is 330% faster than conventional methods. The system offers latency of as low as 20 ms. Using smart contracts, the proposed model provides role-based access control and helps in building scalable and harmonious digital healthcare platforms.	medical services;internet of things;authentication;blockchains;intelligent sensors;smart contracts;physical unclonable function;body sensors;blockchain;emotional intelligence;healthcare;internet of thingsauthentication;internet;scheme
449	实体经济	Medical Data Storage Model Based on an Alliance Chain	Aiming at the problems of centralized storage, low sharing efficiency, and the security and privacy of traditional medical data, a medical data storage model based on a consortium chain is proposed. First, the Distance algorithm is designed based on the geographical relationship of nodes, which reduces the amount of communication between nodes, improves the communication efficiency between A nodes, and ensures the efficiency and reliability of grouping. Second, the dynamic election is combined with the Distance algorithm to design the election strategy of the primary node, which realizes the scientific and reasonable ranking of the medical nodes, improves the reliability of the selection of the primary node, and ensures the efficiency of the medical nodes in the alliance chain to quickly reach consensus when the medical data are uploaded to the chain. Finally, the model designs a method of information separation, which combines the distributed database IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) with the blockchain, which greatly reduces the pressure of medical data storage in the blockchain and improves the operation efficiency. The experimental results show that the medical data storage model can effectively improve the problem of the sharp increase in the amount of communication between medical nodes in the network and reduce the impact of malicious consensus nodes.	medical federated chain;storage model;pbft algorithm;consensus algorithm

451	市场治理	Speculative bubbles and herding in cryptocurrencies	This study investigates speculative bubbles in the cryptocurrency market and factors affecting bubbles during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that each cryptocurrency covered in the study presented bubbles. Moreover, we found that explosive behavior in one currency leads to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies. During the pandemic, herd behavior was evident among investors; however, this diminishes during bubbles, indicating that bubbles are not explained by herd behavior. Regarding cryptocurrency and market-specific factors, we found that Google Trends and volume are positively associated with predicting speculative bubbles in time-series and panel probit regressions. Hence, investors should exercise caution when investing in cryptocurrencies and follow both crypto currency and market-related factors to estimate bubbles. Alternative liquidity, volatility, and Google Trends measures are used for robustness analysis and yield similar results. Overall, our results suggest that bubble behavior is common in the cryptocurrency market, contradicting the efficient market hypothesis.	cryptocurrency;bubbles;co-explosivity;herding;covid-19 pandemicexplosive behavior;investors herd;bitcoin;price;inefficiency;risk;covariance;volatility;exuberance;returns
452	实体经济	Blockchain for Food Tracking	A food shortage, which has increased with the climate crisis, will be one of the biggest problems of the world, together with water scarcity, in the future and will damage the sustainability of the food supply system. With the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, food resources are decreasing, and food prices are rising all over the world. The decrease in food sources increases the importance of food tracking even more. The exorbitant price increases after the COVID-19 pandemic are the most concrete indicators of this. Blockchain-based food tracking systems will be of critical importance because they will prevent exorbitant price increases with their contribution to food tracking processes, such as reliability and transparency. In this study, the establishment of a blockchain-based food tracking system in Turkey, its operation, and its results will be discussed. It was concluded that 97.54% of the participants using the established system found the application useful and wanted such an application to become widespread. In addition, comparing the performance data of the established blockchain-based system with other blockchain infrastructures, a value of 0.038 s for latency is 435 times better than Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain infrastructures.

In addition, a dual-chain architecture, which contains two types of blockchains, namely TraChain and SerChain, and a hierarchical encryption scheme of the data on the chain, are proposed to ensure the integrity of transaction data and fine-grained privacy protection of users. Furthermore, we describe a new set of smart contracts to ensure safe transactions for the entire service trading. Security analysis and simulation results confirm that the proposed STEB can achieve more efficient contract execution and enhance service transaction privacy.	authentication;scheme

To date, the use of the Internet is one of the most effective means of managing forces and financial resources. To finance their activities, terrorists, in addition to actively using international Muslim humanitarian funds, speculating on stock exchanges, investing in real estate, in a number of legal sectors of the economy, as well as participating in the criminal business of a number of countries, began to actively use cryptocurrency. These funds are used to create new and finance sleeping cells, fundraising is organized to carry out specific terrorist attacks, the formation of their own cyber units, which, vice versa, are able to extract financial resources through hacker attacks using remote theft, extortion, the sale of weapons and drugs as predicate crimes, the means of committing which is often the use of cryptocurrencies.	cryptocurrency;bitcoin;terrorist financing;al-qaeda;peer-to-peer networks;computer attacks;social engineeringcriminal prosecution
455	协同技术	FedMarket: A Cryptocurrency Driven Marketplace for Mobile Federated Learning Services	Federated learning (FL) enables the training of a shared collaborative machine learning model while keeping all the confidential training data on distributed devices. The FL state-of-the-art considers a monopolist FL task publisher. However, we present a FL marketplace where multiple FL task publishers and mobile devices co-exist for a set of diverse and varying learning tasks. Mobile devices participating in the training of FL models provides pay-as-you-go (i.e. using blockchain-based cryptocurrencies) FL training services to the FL task publishers. In the proposed framework, multiple FL task publishers may compete with each other and the participating workers (i.e. mobile devices) can choose one FL task publisher over another for participation in the training of a global model. We utilize code offloading for enabling customized FL pipelines in mobile devices and mitigating the model heterogeneity inherent in varying and changing FL tasks published by the task publishers. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of the proposed framework.	collaborative work;mobile handsets;training data;servers;data models;machine learning;blockchains;smart contracts;computational modeling;federated learning;blockchain;smart contract;marketplace;computational offloadingmechanism
456	协同技术	A field test of a federated learning/federated analytic blockchain network implementation in an HPC environment	The rapid upswing in interest in federated learning (FL) and federated analytics (FA) architectures has corresponded with the rapid increase in commercial AI software products, ranging from face detection and language translation to connected IOT devices, smartphones, and autonomous vehicles equipped with high-resolution sensors. However, the traditional client-server model does not readily address questions of data ownership, privacy, and data location in the context of the multiple datasets required for machine learning. In this paper, we report on a pilot distributed ledger and smart contract network model, designed to track analytic jobs in an HPC supercomputing environment. The test system design integrates the FL/FA model into a blockchain-based network architecture, wherein the test system records interactions with the global server and blockchain network. The design goal is to create a secure audit trail of supercomputer analytic operations and the ability to securely federate those operations across multiple supercomputer deployments. As there are still relatively few real-world applications of FL/FA models and blockchain networks in use, our system design, test deployment, and sample code are intended to provide interested researchers with exploratory tools for future research.	federated learning;federated analytics;blockchain;distributed ledger technology;data governance;hpc
457	核心技术	Machine-as-a-Service: Blockchain-based management and maintenance of industrial appliances	Machine-as-a-Service (MaaS) is an emerging service model for industrial appliances. With MaaS, machines are rented instead of being acquired, and their lifecycle is handled by an ecosystem of specialized actors, such as different independent maintenance companies certified for interventions on specific hardware. As the number of actors, clients, and providers involved in a MaaS ecosystem grows, maintaining mutual trust relationships between all involved parties and orchestrating MaaS operations in centralized fashion quickly becomes intractable. We present a blockchain-based approach to providing MaaS in industrial settings where rented machines are equipped with IoT sensors, and where MaaS operations are orchestrated in a transparent, decentralized, and scalable way using a collection of smart contracts deployed over an infrastructure combining the Ethereum and InterPlanetary File System decentralized services. We detail the operations of MaaS, such as the lifecycle of management operations, and report on the performance of a prototype implementation deployed in the cloud.	blockchain;industry;iot;machine-as-a-service;telemetry
458	核心技术	Blockchain-Based Reliable and Efficient Certificateless Signature for IIoT Devices	Nowadays, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has remarkably transformed our personal lifestyles and society operations into a novel digital mode, which brings tremendous associations with all walks of life, such as intelligent logistics, smart grid, and smart city. Moreover, with the rapid increase of IIoT devices, a large amount of data is swapped between heterogeneous sensors and devices every moment. This trend increases the risk of eavesdropping and hijacking attacks in communication channels, so maintaining data privacy and security becomes two notable concerns at present. Recently, based on the mechanism of the Schnorr signature, a more secure and lightweight certificateless signature (CLS) protocol is popular for the resource-constrained IIoT protocol design. Nevertheless, we found most of the existing CLS schemes are susceptible to several common security weaknesses such as man-in-the-middle attacks, key generation center compromised attacks, and distributed denial of service attacks. To tackle the challenges mentioned previously, in this article, we propose a novel pairing-free certificateless scheme that utilizes the state-of-the-art blockchain technique and smart contract to construct a novel reliable and efficient CLS scheme. Then, we simulate the Type-I and Type-II adversaries to verify the trustworthiness of our scheme. Security analysis as well as performance evaluation outcomes prove that our design can hold more reliable security assurance with less computation cost (i.e., reduced by around 40.0% at most) and communication cost (i.e., reduced by around 94.7% at most) than other related schemes.	industrial internet of things;security;smart contracts;elliptic curves;5g mobile communication;generators;denial-of-service attack;blockchain;certificateless signature (cls);industrial internet of things (iiot);internet of things (iot);security and privacyprovably-secure;scheme
459	核心技术	An Approach for Blockchain Pool Mining Employing the Consensus Protocol Robust against Block Withholding and Selfish Mining Attacks	This paper proposes an approach for pool mining in public blockchain systems based on the employment of a recently reported consensus protocol with the puzzle based on a symmetric encryption that provides an energy-space trade-off and reduces energy consumption. The proposed architecture employs a pseudo-symmetric allocation of the resources for the blockchain consensus protocol and provides protection against certain malicious actions of the pool members, as well as a miner's opportunity for selecting the resources required for participation in the consensus protocol. Given that the considered consensus protocol employs two resources, the proposed architecture uses this two-dimensional nature to provide resistance against block withholding and selfish mining attacks, as well as a reduction in energy spending as a trade-off with the employment of certain memory resources. The high resistance of the proposed pool mining approach against the considered attacks appears to be a consequence of the success probability of the pool in comparison with the success probability of malicious miners. Assuming appropriate selection of the puzzle hardness, the probability that malicious miners can solve the puzzle without the support of the pool manager can be arbitrarily small. Implementation of the proposed approach on a modified Ethereum platform and experimental evaluation issues have also been reported. The conceptual novelty of the proposed pool mining approach is the following: Instead of separation of the blockchain consensus protocol and control of pool miners honest work, this paper proposes an approach where honest work of miners and pool managers is provided by a dedicated application of the considered consensus protocol. Advantages of the proposal in comparison with the previously reported ones include the following: (i) high resistance against block withholding and selfish mining attacks without an additional security procedure; (ii) reduction in the energy required, and at the same time preservationthe security of the consensus protocol; (iii) flexibility of the pool miners regarding selection of the resources that should be employed providing a trade-off between required energy and memory resources. The proposed architecture was implemented employing a dedicated modification of the Ethereum platform and the performed experiments confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposal.	blockchain;consensus protocol;pool mining;symmetric encryption;security evaluation;selfish mining;withholding attacksecurity evaluation;networks
460	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based IoT-Enabled E-Waste Tracking and Tracing System for Smart Cities	Recycling of electronic waste is a rapidly growing global issue that requires proper monitoring and tracing of electronic devices and the business transactions between the stakeholders. The majority of current systems that manage electronic devices throughout their supply chain stages are centralized and lack data transparency, immutability, and security. Specifically, such systems are incapable of handling problems like comprehensive coverage of the life cycle of e-products, access control for maintaining data security, reputation-aware selection of stakeholders, and large amounts of data generated during various stages of the supply chain processes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based IoT-enabled system for monitoring all post-production business processes, activities, and operations performed on an electronic device. The system is supported by five smart contracts that record the actions of users on the immutable distributed ledger that aid in ensuring that the business processes carried out by the participants are transparent, traceable, and secure. To store large files, such as images of e-waste materials, products, and licenses for stakeholders, we have integrated our system with a distributed storage system. The proposed system is tested on Ethereum blockchain to check the gas consumption of the functions of the smart contracts. The cost and security analysis shows that the proposed system is viable.	electronic waste;blockchains;stakeholders;waste management;supply chains;security;consumer electronics;internet of things;smart cities;blockchain;smart cities;security;e-waste;traceability;iot;ethereumequipment
461	实体经济	Cooperative game consistency optimal strategy of multi-microgrid system considering flexible load	In this paper, a cooperative game consistency optimal scheduling strategy for islanded multi-microgrid systems is proposed to solve the problem of energy mutualization and economic scheduling. Firstly, considering the power loss, flexible load demand, and other operating indicators, to maximize the user and supplier benefits, the real-time transaction electricity price model of the user side and the power supply side is constructed. On this basis, considering the energy sharing among microgrids and aiming at minimizing the operating cost of the multi-microgrid system, a multi-microgrid cooperative game optimization scheduling model is established. Then, the optimal solution of the cooperative game model is obtained by using the consensus algorithm of equal increment rate. The equivalence between the real-time transaction price of the user side and the power supply side and the transaction price on the microgrid is proven. The Shapley value method is used to complete the benefit distribution of each microgrid. Finally, the validity and reliability of the method are verified by an islanded multi-microgrid system. Simulation results show that when multiple microgrids are involved in a cooperative game, by optimizing the transaction electricity price among microgrids and the output of controllable distributed units, regulating and flexible load demand, energy sharing among microgrids can be achieved, and the overall operating costs of the alliance can be reduced. The total daily scheduling cost of cooperative game alliance is 1749 USD less than that of independent operation mode. Solving the cooperative game model by using an equal increment rate consensus algorithm allows the optimal global solutions to be obtained quickly, and the solution time is only 0.6 s, and effectively suppresses the negative effects of fluctuating or uncertain factors on the multi-microgrid system.	islanded multi-microgrid system;real-time transaction electricity price;flexible load demand;cooperative game;consensus algorithm;shapley value methodoptimal energy management

In addition to attracting the attention of investors, speculators, and regulators, implications for financial practitioners and organizations are increasingly apparent. Financial transactions, property transfers, audit and attestation services, supply chains, and numerous other areas of industry are continuing to integrate blockchains into operations. This paper bridges the gap between the technical concept of blockchain and relevance to the accounting field. By distilling technical components of blockchain into understandable components, practitioners and other users of this research are poised to better understand, explain, and apply salient concepts. This paper proposes a Hyperledger Composer use case method through which practitioners and researchers can familiarize themselves with blockchain concepts using an interactive demonstration of an accounting integration for intangible assets.

463	虚拟经济	From Radio to Metaverse. Old and New Issues with Liturgy and Media	The relationship between Liturgy and Media is very complex and multi-layered. This paper looks at the beginnings of broadcasts of liturgical services on radio and television and recalls the brief but heated discussion in the 1950s, in which Romano Guardini and Karl Rahner, among others, rejected them with reference to arcane discipline. In the face of de facto success of liturgical broadcasts, the concept of intentional participation in worship by those not physically present was coined. The current pandemic has seen a significant increase in the number of church service broadcasts, livestreams, and other digital offerings. These, with their more and more interactive potentials, and the Internet's progression into the metaverse raise numerous fundamental liturgical and sacramental theological questions. Many of these are not as new as they may seem.	liturgy;metaverse;sacraments;digitalization;theology

A Metaverse, which is parallel to the physical world, needs mature and secure Digital Twins technology in addition to Parallel Intelligence to enable it to evolve autonomously. We propose that Blockchain combined with other areas does not simultaneously require all of the basic elements. We extract the immutable characteristics of Blockchain and propose a secure multidimensional data storage solution called BlockNet that can ensure the security of the digital mapping process of the Internet of Things, thereby improving the data reliability of Digital Twins. Additionally, to address some of the challenges faced by multiscale spatial data processing, we propose a nonmutagenic multidimensional Hash Geocoding method, allowing unique indexing of multidimensional information and avoiding information loss due to data dimensionality reduction while improving the efficiency of information retrieval and facilitating the implementation of the Metaverse through spatial Digital Twins based on these two studies.	blockchain
465	实体经济	A drone-based data management and optimization using metaheuristic algorithms and blockchain smart contracts in a secure fog environment	The advent of fog computing as an extension of cloud-enabling technology has moved from the hub of the internet framework to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled control and man-agement of drone-based data. The key objectives are to improve the computation and processing of drone-based resource constraints and deliver the data to the outsourced computational node to schedule, process, manage, optimize, and preserve it since they are located close to each other through a wireless sensor network. This collaborative technological approach to robustness is the standard of drone system design and implementation, reducing the computational power, resource consumption, and latency for the application that needs a fast response. However, recent research into fog-enabled drone-based data management and optimization poses a serious chal-lenge in terms of privacy, security, and preservation. On the other hand, Blockchain Hyperledger Technology, which is mostly used in Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies, has been applied in a large number of distributed applications due to the ledger integrity, transparency, trustworthiness, provenance, reliability, availability, protection, and security-related distributed features that are provided. Therefore, the distributed application of drone control has received more attention because of its ability to handle collaborative procedures to capture, schedule, process, optimize, manage, and preserve drone-based data using fog nodes and blockchain hyperledger technology. In this paper, we proposed a collaborative approach using blockchain hyperledger fabric and a metaheuristic-enabled genetic algorithm for fog node management called B-Drone. This approach handles drone-based data collection, scheduling, optimizing, processing, managing, and preservation in a secure manner in the fog node. The protection of each transaction between drone and fog node before exchange is private with the utilization of the hash-encryption (SHA-256) algorithm. The blockchain smart contracts are implemented and deployed to auto-manage all the connectivity and communication protocols between drones and fog nodes in the designed private permissioned network. The simulations of the proposed collaborative approach reduce the computing cost down to 12.03% and increase the performance up to 73.11%, thus decreasing the cost of drone -ledger preservation down to 30.13% and the robust usage of the network up to 54.29% as compared to other state-of-the-art methods .	blockchain;smart contract;metaheuristic;genetic algorithm;fog node;drone data management and optimizationservices;issues
466	市场治理	Price Prediction of Cryptocurrency Using a Multi-Layer Gated Recurrent Unit Network with Multi Features	In today's world the cryptocurrencies have taken a special place in the financial market with the aid of time series forecasting and with a market value of almost USD 1.5 Trillion as of August 2021. These financial commodities show more volatility and effect of different internal and external forces. The prediction of such cryptocurrencies is a time consuming and difficult affair. In this paper, an attempt is made with a multilayer Gated Recurrent Unit based model for price prediction of cryptocurrencies. The currencies considered in this work are Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin and are pre-processed to deal with the NaN values. The LSTM model, one variant of recurrent neural network is used initially for predication. Further, the Gated Recurrent Unit is used with single feature. However, it is observed that for multiple features with three layers of Gated Recurrent Units based model is working well with error minimization. The performance of the proposed model is compared with other two models over a 21-day forecasting window. The proposed model is found to provide better performance in terms of different parameters like mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, p-value, and precision values than the other two models.	crypto-currency;prediction;gated recurrent unit;long short-term memory;mean absolute percentage errorbitcoin;volatility

Recently, investors worldwide have been interested in cryptocurrencies with increasing acceleration due to high earning expectations though they have no backing and intrinsic value. As such, this paper seeks to identify the most proper cryptocurrencies from an investment standpoint in our technological era. Fifteen well-known cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization are evaluated as per sixteen factors. An intuitionistic fuzzy set-driven methodology incorporating Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), Multi-Attributive Ideal Real Comparative Analysis (MAIRCA, and Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS), which is the study's prominent novelty, has been applied to provide a strong group decision vehicle for cryptocurrency selection. Notwithstanding, although the results obtained with the three approaches are highly consistent, investors would not like to doubt the instrument they will invest in. The Borda count is then applied to obtain a compromise for the rankings obtained from each approach. As per our findings, Ethereum, Tether, and Bitcoin are the most suitable cryptocurrencies, whereas reliable software, ease of inclusion in the wallet, and stability are the foremost factors to consider when investing in cryptocurrencies. The findings are further discussed in detail from a financial perspective. The proposed approach could be employed to select different investment instruments in future studies.	mcdm;intuitionistic fuzzy sets;cryptocurrency;cryptocurrency selection;investment decisions;financial innovation;industry 4.0energy-consumption;bitcoin;selection;connectedness;intention;markets;waspas
468	市场治理	Assessing the Risk Characteristics of the Cryptocurrency Market: A GARCH-EVT-Copula Approach	The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but also entails higher risks as compared to other asset classes. This article aims to analyse the financial risk characteristics of individual cryptocurrencies and of a broad cryptocurrency market portfolio. We construct a portfolio comprising the 20 largest cryptocurrencies, which cover 82.1% of the total cryptocurrency market. The returns are examined for extreme tail risks by the application of Extreme Value Theory. We utilise the GARCH-EVT approach in combination with a novel algorithm to automatically determine the optimal threshold to model the tail distribution. Furthermore, we aggregate the individual market risks with a t-Student Copula to investigate possible diversification effects on a portfolio level. The empirical analysis indicates that all examined cryptocurrencies show high volatility in their price movements, whereby Bitcoin acts as the most stable cryptocurrency. All return distributions are heavy-tailed and subject to extreme tail risks. We find strong, positive intra-market correlations, in particular with the two largest cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. No diversification effect can be achieved by aggregating market risks. On the contrary, a negligibly lower expected return and higher joint extreme returns can be observed. From this analysis, it can be concluded that investments in individual cryptocurrencies as well as in a portfolio show extreme risks of losses. From the investor's point of view, a possible strategy of risk reduction through portfolio formation within cryptocurrencies is only promising to a limited extent and does not offer a satisfactory solution to significantly reduce the risk within this asset class.	cryptocurrencies;extreme value theory;garch;copulas;cryptocurrency portfolio;garch-evt;risk management

We use daily return data for seven MSCI-classified African stock exchanges between 2011 and 2021. As Bitcoin has become an important asset class on the African continent, we also explore whether this cryptocurrency confers any diversification benefits. Our method holds that stock markets are integrated if there is a significant flow of information between exchanges. The results reveal a statistically insignificant flow of information among African stock exchanges, and for the few cases in which information flow is statistically significant, the magnitudes are low. South Africa is the most influential stock market, as it transmits most of the total transfer entropy (informational value) in the system. We also observe that African stock exchanges are weakly integrated with Bitcoin.	bitcoin;information theory;stock market integration;transfer entropyflow
471	平台项目	Time-varying dependence of Bitcoin	This paper analyzes Bitcoin investment in terms of portfolio diversification. Over the period July 2011-April 2021, we use the copula-GARCH approach to test the time-varying dependence of Bitcoin in a portfolio composed of six stock markets (CAC40, DJIA, EUROSTOXX50, FTSE100, HANGSENG, and NIKKEI225). Our results reveal that volatility modeling provides better results with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation model. The performance of the portfolio is largely due to the high returns of Bitcoin which allows for better portfolio diversification. As a result, there is a mitigation of the extreme rates of return associated with crypto-currencies. Finally, while Bitcoin's contribution to the portfolio is more attributable to its risk than its return, it does play a role in stabilizing portfolio performance, for varying levels of risk.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.	bitcoin;copula-garch model;portfolio diversification;portfolio risk;robust mcd portfoliovalue-at-risk;safe haven;copula;hedge;asymmetry;currency;gold

Design/methodology/approach The authors undertake comprehensive analyses of the dependency dynamics, systemic risk and volatility spillover between major East Asian stock and Bitcoin markets. The authors employ a vine-copula-CoVaR framework and a VAR-BEKK-GARCH method with a Wald test. Findings (a) With exception of KS11 and N225; HSI and SSE; HSI and KS11, which have moderate dependence, dependencies among other markets are low. In terms of tail risk, the upper tail risk is more significant in capturing strong common variation. (b) Two-way and asymmetric risk spillover effects exist in all markets. The Hong Kong and Japanese stock markets have significant risk spillovers to other markets, and quite notably, the Chinese stock market is the largest recipient of systemic risk. However, the authors observe a more significant risk spillover from the Chinese stock market to the Bitcoin market. (c) The VAR-BEKK-GARCH results confirm that the Korean market is a significant emitter of volatility spillovers. The Bitcoin market does provide diversification benefits. Interestingly, the Chinese stock market has an intriguing relationship with Bitcoin. (d) An increase in spillovers in East Asia boosts spillovers to Bitcoin, but there is no intuitive effect of Bitcoin spillovers on East Asian spillovers.

473	实体经济	A Reputation-Based Approach Using Consortium Blockchain for Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing	The CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) sharing and exchange is an effective method to improve the responsiveness of the protection party. Blockchain technology enables sharing collaboration consortium to conduct a trusted CTI sharing and exchange without a centralized institution. However, the distributed connectivity of the blockchain-based CTI sharing model proposed before exposes the systems to byzantine attacks. The compromised members of partner organizations will further decrease the accuracy and trust level of CTI by generating false reporting. This paper proposes a new blockchain-based CTI model to address the unbalance issues of performance in speed, scalability, and security, which combines consortium blockchain and distributed reputation management systems to achieve automated analysis and response of tactical threat intelligence. In addition, the novel consensus algorithm of consortium blockchain that is fit for CTI sharing and exchange is introduced in this paper. The new consensus algorithm is called "Proof-of Reputation" (PoR) consensus, which meets the requirements of transaction rate and makes the consensus in a creditable network environment through constructing a reputation model. Finally, the effectiveness and security performance of the proposed model and consensus algorithm is verified by experiments.	intrusion detection
474	实体经济	Exploration and Practice of the Acquisition Path of Spoken English for Special Purposes with the Blockchain Technology	With the increasing trend of globalization, English, as the most widely used language in the world, has become a subject that many people must learn. English for special purposes is mainly applied to some specialized occupations or English in specific professional skill fields. Due to the increasing national demand for professional compound talents, the status of English for special purposes is also getting higher and higher. However, there are still many problems in the curriculum setting of English for special purposes, for example, outdated teaching mode, lack of oral language skills training, lack of students' ability to cope with actual situations, weak teaching awareness of teachers, and lack of analysis of students' needs for English for special purposes, resulting in poor students' enthusiasm for learning and so on. With the support of blockchain technology, combined with consensus algorithm, hash function algorithm, and smart contract, this paper analyzes English for special purposes, establishes an ESP management system and a corpus of spoken English for special purposes, and analyzes the integrity of the corpus data. The test found that when the number of error data blocks is 10, the total number of damaged data blocks and verification accuracy data blocks is about 4% in order to achieve 99% accuracy. Therefore, the integrity of the system is higher when the damage ratio is lower. The system integrity test finds that, with the number of wrong data being larger, when the wrong data block is at 100, 50% of the data blocks of the system integrity are about 1%. The database is complete, which is more helpful for students to study systematically.

To increase the performance of green CAV, the data generated by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and associated infrastructure needs to be processed in real-time. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising paradigm that can be integrated with green CAV to save energy and to improve the network performance in terms of low latency for data processing. However, MEC servers and other communication entities in green CAV environment cannot be fully trusted and may bring vulnerabilities related to data privacy and security. Motivated by the above challenges, we design a blockchain and Deep-Learning (DL)-enabled secure data processing framework for an edge-envisioned green CAV environment (hereafter referred to as BDEdge). In blockchain-based scheme, all communication entities are registered, verified and thereafter validated using smart contract-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm. The authenticated data is forwarded to DL scheme. In DL-based scheme, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a hybrid model of Sparse Auto-Encoder-enabled Attention Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (SAE-ABIGRU) is designed by analyzing the link load behaviors of the MEC-enabled Road Side Unit (RSU) server. The security analysis and comparative simulation findings shows that the proposed BDEdge framework can significantly reduce false alarm rate and increase accuracy close to 99%.	green products;blockchains;servers;security;image edge detection;intrusion detection;computational modeling;blockchain;connected and autonomous vehicles (cavs);deep-learning;green communication;edge computing (ec);intrusion detection system (ids)iot;framework;internet
477	协同技术	Blockchain and Machine Learning for Fraud Detection: A Privacy-Preserving and Adaptive Incentive Based Approach	Financial fraud cases are on the rise even with the current technological advancements. Due to the lack of inter-organization synergy and because of privacy concerns, authentic financial transaction data is rarely available. On the other hand, data-driven technologies like machine learning need authentic data to perform precisely in real-world systems. This study proposes a blockchain and smart contract-based approach to achieve robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for e-commerce fraud detection by facilitating inter-organizational collaboration. The proposed method uses blockchain to secure the privacy of the data. Smart contract deployed inside the network fully automates the system. An ML model is incrementally upgraded from collaborative data provided by the organizations connected to the blockchain. To incentivize the organizations, we have introduced an incentive mechanism that is adaptive to the difficulty level in updating a model. The organizations receive incentives based on the difficulty faced in updating the ML model. A mining criterion has been proposed to mine the block efficiently. And finally, the blockchain network is tested under different difficulty levels and under different volumes of data to test its efficiency. The model achieved 98.93% testing accuracy and 98.22% Fbeta score (recall-biased f measure) over eight incremental updates. Our experiment shows that both data volume and difficulty level of blockchain impacts the mining time. For difficulty level less than five, mining time and difficulty level has a positive correlation. For difficulty level two and three, less than a second is required to mine a block in our system. Difficulty level five poses much more difficulties to mine the blocks.	blockchains;machine learning;smart contracts;adaptation models;data models;smart contracts;computational modeling;collaboration;financial industry;blockchain;collaborative machine learning;incremental learning;privacy;smart contracttechnology
478	核心技术	Cell Based Raft Algorithm for Optimized Consensus Process on Blockchain in Smart Data Market	Due to the explosive increase in IoT devices and traffic, big data is developing into smart data that helps the data science experts understand human activities, through the relationship between mobility and resource application of the users in public spaces. For example, smart data markets help to predict crimes or understand the cause of COVID-19 infections. For these smart services, the users agree to the privacy policy so that the personal and sensitive information can be collected by a third party. But the conditions of the privacy policy do not specify whether the information of the users can be tracked. To ensure data transparency, many systems are applying consortium/private blockchains with raft algorithm. The raft algorithm requires nodes to check countless messages for a single transaction. Eventually, as the number of nodes increases, the overall system degradation is derived from the burden of the leader node. This paper proposes a method to process the collected transactions by dividing a certain amount of transactions into cells, without any extra protocol. The proposed scheme also uses the federated learning model with high accuracy and data privacy, in order to determine the optimized cell size in a blockchain system that should lead to consensus on multiple servers. Therefore, the proposed CBR (Cell-based Raft) consensus algorithm proposes a protocol that reduces the number of messages, without interfering with the concept of the existing raft algorithm, in order to maintain stable throughput in the smart data market where massive transactions occur.	blockchains;servers;consensus algorithm;collaborative work;internet of things;throughput;smart devices;data science;smart service;blockchain;consensus algorithm;raft algorithm;federated learningarchitecture
479	实体经济	Construction 4.0, Industry 4.0, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for Sustainable Building Development within the Smart City	At present, the smart city offers the most desired state of urban development, encompassing, as it does, the concept of sustainable development. The creation of a smart city is closely associated with upgrading the construction industry to encompass many emerging concepts and technologies, such as Construction 4.0, with its roots in Industry 4.0, and the deployment of building information modeling (BIM) as an essential tool for the construction industry. Therefore, this paper aims to explore the current state of the art and development trajectory of the multidisciplinary integration of Construction 4.0, Industry 4.0, BIM, and sustainable construction in the context of the smart city. It is the first attempt in the literature to use both macro-quantitative analysis and micro-qualitative analysis methods to investigate this multidisciplinary research topic. By using the visual bibliometric tool, VOSviewer, and based on macro keyword co-occurrence, this paper is the first to reveal the five keyword-constructed schemes, research hotspots, and development trends of the smart city, Construction 4.0, Industry 4.0, BIM, and sustainable construction, from 2014 to 2021 (a period of eight years). Additionally, the top 11 productive subject areas have been identified with the help of VOSviewer software keyword-clustering analysis and application. Furthermore, the whole-building life cycle is considered as an aid to identifying research gaps and trends, providing suggestions for future research with the assistance of an upgraded version of BIM, namely, city information modeling (CIM) and the future integration of Industry 5.0 and Construction 5.0, or even of Industry Metaverse with Construction Metaverse.	smart city;construction 4;0;industry 4;0;building information modeling (bim);sustainable building;construction metaverse;life cycle stage;keyword co-occurrence;visualization;bibliometric;vosviewerlife-cycle assessment;existing buildings;early-stage;design;energy;integration;optimization;management;internet;trends
480	虚拟经济	Prospecting non-fungible tokens in the digital economy: Stakeholders and ecosystem, risk and opportunity	Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a highly nascent and emerging phenom-enon revolutionizing how digital assets are traded. NFTs embody immutable rights to unique digital assets such as digital art and collectibles and are represented as digital tokens that can be traded across marketplaces utilizing blockchain technol-ogies. NFTs engender new ways to organize, consume, move, program, and store digital information and have experienced a rapid rise in various adaptations across art, sports, broadcasting, content creation, and tech-crypto businesses. In this article, we define NFTs and look at how they fit with blockchain and cryptocurren-cies, how they are used by various industries, and the opportunities and risks they present. Our key contribution is a conceptual map of an initial NFT ecosystem. In doing so, we provide relational mapping between and among key stakeholders: con-tent creators, core and related technical and business intermediaries, consumers, investors, and speculators. We also highlight implications for managers and tie them to conceptual exploration and exploitation frameworks.(c) 2021 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We observe an increase in the average correlation due to a rise in popularity of Ether. We also find that an increase in uncertainty leads to the low Bitcoin-Ether correlation, suggesting that investors revise the relative valuation during high market uncertainty periods. The relationship between the Bitcoin-Ether correlation and uncertainty is nonlinear, and our search volume results show that investors' attention to both cryptocurrencies increases during the uncertainty periods.	vix;adcc garch;cryptocurrencies;gold;quantile regressionstock;cryptocurrencies;returns;gold
482	核心技术	Financial Contract Administration in Construction via Cryptocurrency Blockchain and Smart Contract: A Proof of Concept	The blockchain that uses cryptocurrency is a paradigm shift in the way of data storage, retrieval, and verification due to the concept of decentralization. This paradigm is essential to ensure the security of crucial data in any project. Adding a smart contract to the blockchain would facilitate the automation of various processes. Thus, the cryptocurrency blockchain that uses the smart contract can be considered a suitable platform for an ecosystem of many industries. The construction industry needs a highly secure automated management system due to its complex contractual relationships and transactions between parties. Therefore, integrating the blockchain with the smart contract creates the most appropriate ecosystem to be developed. This study introduces an ecosystemic prototype using a programmable smart contract within a novel cryptocurrency blockchain for construction. The purpose of the prototype is to guarantee a decentralized system as an independent economic environment for the construction industry. The system guarantees the security of financial transactions and focuses on the payment clauses in the construction contract as well. The results depended on three well-known hypothetical case scenarios from the construction site and were displayed in the form of extracted access data tables. The prototype proved the efficiency of the decentralized system for the construction industry by minimizing human-factor interference in the transaction process and thus reducing time waste and cost.	blockchain;construction;intelligent contract;smart contract;cryptocurrency;project management
483	核心技术	SigRec: Automatic Recovery of Function Signatures in Smart Contracts	Millions of smart contracts have been deployed onto Ethereum for providing various services, whose functions can be invoked. For this purpose, the caller needs to know the function signature of a callee, which includes its function id and parameter types. Such signatures are critical to many applications focusing on smart contracts, e.g., reverse engineering, fuzzing, attack detection, and profiling. Unfortunately, it is challenging to recover the function signatures from contract bytecode, since neither debug information nor type information is present in the bytecode. To address this issue, prior approaches rely on source code, or a collection of known signatures from incomplete databases or incomplete heuristic rules, which, however, are far from adequate and cannot cope with the rapid growth of new contracts. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that leverages how functions are handled by Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) to automatically recover function signatures. In particular, we exploit how smart contracts determine the functions to be invoked to locate and extract function ids, and propose a new approach named type-aware symbolic execution (TASE) that utilizes the semantics of EVM operations on parameters to identify the number and the types of parameters. Moreover, we develop SigRec, a new tool for recovering function signatures from contract bytecode without the need of source code and function signature databases. The extensive experimental results show that SigRec outperforms all existing tools, achieving an unprecedented 98.7 percent accuracy within 0.074 seconds. We further demonstrate that the recovered function signatures are useful in attack detection, fuzzing and reverse engineering of EVM bytecode.	smart contracts;databases;reverse engineering;semantics;lenses;layout;tools;smart contract;function signature;ethereum;automatic recovery;type-aware symbolic execution
484	核心技术	The k+1 Symmetric Test Pattern for Smart Contracts	A smart contract is a pivotal notion in blockchain technology. Distributed applications contain smart contracts verifying the fulfillment of the conditions, which determine the execution of transactions between the blockchain network nodes. Those software-controlled logical conditions are called verification rules. As the number of conditions increases, the complexity of smart contract testing rapidly grows. This paper aims to propose a smart contract testing pattern that significantly limits the needed number of test cases. For evaluation expression with four verification rules, the pattern usage reduces the number of test cases by 68.75% in relation to the full coverage of logical value combinations. With the increase in the number of logical conditions, not only the number of test cases but also their percentage decreases. Starting from seven verification rules in the evaluation expression, the percentage reduction of test cases exceeds 90%. As a result, the cost of preparing and maintaining test case suites may be substantially cut. It should be emphasized that test execution time can be reduced even by 3 orders of magnitude (from seconds to milliseconds). Such an approach is highly important for regression testing, especially when used in continuous software integration, delivery, and deployment approaches.	test pattern;test suite design;smart contract;blockchain;object-oriented programmingtools
485	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Autonomous Notarization System Using National eID Card	In recent years, the spread of information and communication technology has led to the emergence of e-government, which is the electronic replacement of government services. E-government is said to be compatible with blockchain technology, which has led to various studies on the possibility. Notarization, one of the functions of the government, has particularly been examined for the potential adoption of blockchain technology. However, because the notary public must authenticate the document's contents during the notarization process, they have been difficult to replace with smart contracts. In this study, we focus only on fixed date notarizations and propose a fully automated notarization system by combining a national eID card with Public Key Infrastructure and smart contracts. A fixed date is a notarization that allows a notary public to guarantee that a document existed, regardless of the authenticity of the document's content. Therefore, it can be replaced by a smart contract. Specifically, our proposed system automatically authenticates the creator and the document for electronic documents signed with a national eID card and uses the transaction receipt generated when the information is stored on the blockchain as a certificate of notarization. Verification of the signed data is done inside the blockchain by smart contracts, which eliminates the need for a verification authority. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a Japanese use case as proof of concept.	blockchains;smart contracts;authorization;peer-to-peer computing;throughput;resistance;public key;autonomous systems;information and communication technology;electronic government;blockchain;smart contract;ethereum;e-government;national eid card;notarization system;authorization

487	虚拟经济	Social Virtual Reality: Neurodivergence and Inclusivity in the Metaverse	Whereas traditional teaching environments encourage lively and engaged interaction and reward extrovert qualities, introverts, and others with symptoms that make social engagement difficult, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are often disadvantaged. This population is often more engaged in quieter, low-key learning environments and often does not speak up and answer questions in traditional lecture-style classes. These individuals are often passed over in school and later in their careers for not speaking up and are assumed to not be as competent as their gregarious and outgoing colleagues. With the rise of the metaverse and democratization of virtual reality (VR) technology, post-secondary education is especially poised to capitalize on the immersive learning environments social VR provides and prepare students for the future of work, where virtual collaboration will be key. This study seeks to reconsider the role of VR and the metaverse for introverts and those with ASD. The metaverse has the potential to continue the social and workplace changes already accelerated by the pandemic and open new avenues for communication and collaboration for a more inclusive audience and tomorrow.	virtual reality;introversion;neurodivergence;asd;autism;metaverse;future of workskills;people;model

A growing body of economic research informs these activities, often focusing on the "reserves for all" aspect of CBDCs for retail use. However, CBDCs should be considered in the full context of the digital economy and the centrality of data, which raises concerns around competition, payment system integrity, and privacy. This review gives a guided tour of the growing CBDC literature on the microeconomic considerations related to operation architectures, technologies, and privacy as well as the macroeconomic implications for the financial system, financial stability, and monetary policy. A set of questions, particularly on the cross-border dimensions of CBDCs, remains unresolved and calls for further work to expand the research frontier.	money;digital currencies;central banks;central bank digital currencies;cbdc;stablecoins;cryptocurrencies;distributed ledgers;big tech;data privacy
489	市场治理	Designing central bank digital currencies	The optimal design of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is analyzed in an environment where agents sort into cash, CBDC, and bank deposits according to their preferences over anonymity and security; and where network effects make the convenience of a payment instrument depend on the number of its users. A CBDC can be designed with attributes similar to cash or deposits, and can be interest bearing: a CBDC that closely competes with deposits depresses bank credit and output, while a cash-like CBDC may lead to the disappearance of cash. Then, the optimal CBDC design trades off bank intermediation against the social value of maintaining diverse payment instruments. When network effects matter, an interest-bearing CBDC alleviates the central bank's tradeoff. (C) 2021 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier B.V.

490	市场治理	Storying Indigenous cryptocurrency: reckoning with the ghosts of US settler colonialism in the cultural economy	Since 2008, cryptocurrencies, or digital peer-to-peer currencies/assets, have amassed interest and proven unique in their ability to circumvent traditional financial institutions (disintermediation). The system can supersede the nation-state, while also garnering the attention of nation-states and marginalized groups. Indigenous individuals and Nations are among those interested in cryptocurrency, experimenting with it to express resistance to economic imposition beginning in the colonial era. Utilizing an Indigenous storytelling method, this article unveils the technological life and afterlife of an altcoin, MazaCoin, as a ghost of empire, insofar as it links the technological present of financial capital and the past (and ongoing present) of US settler colonialism. Throughout its various complicated reanimations, it expresses a relentless remembering of settler colonial injustices, performing productive haunting work within the twenty-first century cryptocurrency ecosystem. This article offers a reminder that there is much to learn about Indigenous alternative currencies in the cultural economy as the strings of racism, settler colonialism, poverty, financialization, and empire continue to tangle.	indigenous;settler colonialism;cryptocurrency;digital currency;mazacoin;technological hauntingdecolonization;community;politics
491	市场治理	On Optimizing Transaction Fees in Bitcoin using AI: Investigation on Miners Inclusion Pattern	The transaction-rate bottleneck built into popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, leads to fee markets where transactions are included according to a first-price auction for block space. Many attempts have been made to adjust and predict the fee volatility, but even well-formed transactions sometimes experience unexpected delays and evictions unless a substantial fee is offered. In this article, we propose a novel transaction inclusion model that describes the mechanisms and patterns governing miners decisions to include individual transactions in the Bitcoin system. Using this model we devise a Machine Learning (ML) approach to predict transaction inclusion. We evaluate our predictions method using historical observations of the Bitcoin network from a five month period that includes more than 30 million transactions and 120 million entries. We find that our ML model can predict fee volatility with an accuracy of up to 91%. Our findings enable Bitcoin users to improve their fee expenses and the approval time for their transactions.	bitcoin;blockchain;fee market;first price auction;transaction inclusion;cryptocurrencies;proof-of-work;machine learningbig data;machine;prediction
492	市场治理	The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on return-volume and return-volatility relationships in cryptocurrency markets	Understanding the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets during financial crises such as the recent one caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for policy makers and investors. In this study, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the return-volatility and return-volume relationships for the ten most traded cryptocurrencies, namely Tether, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Chainlink, Cardano, and Monero is examined. Fur-ther, the behavior of cryptocurrencies during COVID-19 pandemic is compared with less volatile markets such as Gold, WTI, and BRENT crude oil markets. To study the effect of volatility on cryptocurrency return, an EGARCH-M model is employed while for the return-volume relationships the VAR model and Granger causality tests are uti-lized. Results show that the return-volatility relationships for Tether, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Monero are significant during COVID-19 pandemic, while the same relationship is not significant prior to the pandemic for any of the studied cryptocurrencies. Our findings of the return-volume relationship support the availability of causal relations from return to trading volume changes for Chainlink and Monero in the pre-COVID-19 period and for Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, and Cardano during the COVID-19 period. However, considering the absolute values of returns, we found a significant relationship from cryptocurrencies' absolute returns to trading volume changes for both the prior and during COVID-19 periods. From a managerial perspec-tive, gold can be considered a suitable asset for portfolio hedging during the pandemic period and trading volume can help traders and investors identify the effect of momentum and potential trend in cryptocurrencies on their investments.	cryptocurrency;return-volume relationship;return-volatility relationship;covid-19 pandemic;granger causality;egarch-mtrading volume;stock returns;price changes;garch;models
493	市场治理	Portfolio selection: should investors include crypto-assets? A multiobjective approach	This paper analyzes the diversification benefits of adding alternative crypto-assets in a traditional portfolio, from the perspective of an investor who seeks to achieve multiple objectives. Our analysis is based on daily and weekly return data for eight different assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, for the crypto-assets and NASDAQ, S&P500, Dow-Jones, Crude-Oil, and Gold, for traditional assets. We use both in-sample and out-of-sample estimation procedures to analyze these data sets. We apply the weighted sum of deviations goal programming method to solve a bi-objective optimization problem where investors optimize simultaneously portfolio risk and return. For a variety of investor characteristics, ranging from risk-seeking to risk-averse, we show that augmenting portfolios with alternative crypto-currencies improves portfolio performance and the efficiency frontier, compared to standard portfolios. This improvement is even more observable for risk-seeking investors, for both in-sample and out-of-sample estimation procedures.	portfolio selection;crypto-assets;diversification;bi-objective optimization;goal programmingbitcoin;currency
494	市场治理	Bitcoin as a Safe-Haven Asset and a Medium of Exchange	A monetary model is established to introduce that bitcoin does have the characteristics of a price rise when the economic situation is terrible under high risk aversion. At this time, Bitcoin has the property of a safe-haven asset, and when economic conditions are good and risk aversion is low, Bitcoin has a pro-cyclical nature. At this time, Bitcoin has a stronger property as a medium of exchange. To show the movement law of the bitcoin price, we make a logarithmic linearization of the model and simulation, and the result is consistent with the theoretical analysis. To better understand the role of bitcoin in the real economy, several standard portfolio models are used to measure the similarities and differences between gold and bitcoin in an investment portfolio. After the outbreak of COVID-19, bitcoin has shown stronger safe-haven asset properties.	cryptocurrency;covid-19;hedging asset;monetary value;china u.s. stock marketvolatility;blockchain;trust;hedge;money

In this paper, we present a solution that promotes the development of decentralized personal data marketplaces, exploiting the use of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), Decentralized File Storages (DFS) and smart contracts for storing personal data and managing access control in a decentralized way. Moreover, we focus on the issue of a lack of efficient decentralized mechanisms in DLTs and DFSs for querying a certain type of data. For this reason, we propose the use of a hypercube-structured Distributed Hash Table (DHT) on top of DLTs, organized for efficient processing of multiple keyword-based queries on the ledger data. We test our approach with the implementation of a use case regarding the creation of citizen-generated data based on direct participation and the involvement of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The performance evaluation demonstrates the viability of our approach for decentralized data searches, distributed authorization mechanisms and smart contract exploitation.	distributed ledger technology;decentralized file storage;distributed hash table;data marketplace;keyword-based search;citizen-generated datablockchain;framework

More recently, it has also offered the promise of participation, lowering financial barriers, and empowerment-especially to women, the poor, and those residing in the Global South. I argue that the rise of decentralized finance as an alternative development platform is explicitly gendered and calls for feminist analysis. I discuss how cryptocurrency-based approaches to development rest on foundations that are gendered, interacting with hierarchies of race/ethnicity and class. I also explore how they are part of a lineage of neoliberalism, leveraging neoliberal beliefs about entrepreneurialism, financial inclusion, and gender roles. The discussion further introduces the concept of neolibertarianism as an extension of neoliberal logics that advocates for bypassing states entirely in favor of private actors. The current analysis compares this new model of decentralized finance to similarly problematic development trends and assesses how it has-as of yet-failed to deliver on the promises of participation, lowering financial barriers, and empowerment. This analysis concludes with a call to action for feminist and critical scholars, encouraging further work on the topic.	gender;women;political economy;cryptocurrency;decentralized financeauthoritarianism;infrastructures
497	核心技术	SOTF: Secure Organizational Transactions Framework Based on Bitcoin Payment Bridge	Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency where all the transactions are saved in a ledger. Blockchains have good features to be used in different finance applications by using smart contract. Also, blockchains are attractive platform for many industrial domains, including the logistics and supply chain industries. Supply chain technology contributes to record every single asset through its flow, tracking orders, receipts, and payments. There are several relay protocols proposed in previous research; these relay protocols are used to connect different types of blockchains. In this paper, we present a Secure Organizational Transactions Framework (SOTF) based on bridge chain to connect private chain or consortium with public chain which reduces interaction with public blockchain and saves the organization details privately in private chain or consortium. The proposed framework makes it possible for smart contract services to acquire means of payment in the consortium and private chain. Moreover, the proposed framework automates the process of updating the payment non-interactively. In this paper, we validate the communication between organizations blockchain and bitcoin, and find out the development cost of the proposed framework which ensures the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed framework.

498	虚拟经济	Blockchain in Trust with Reputation Management for Financial Stock Market Using Distributed Ledger Technology and Bayesian Theory Based on Fault Tolerance Model	Blockchain, which is at the heart of bitcoin and other digital currencies, is a game-changing technology, particularly in the stock market and financial technology. These characteristics make blockchain adoption appealing for enhancing information security, privacy and reliability in a variety of scenarios. This article develops the trust with reputation-based management for the financial stock market. Here distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been integrated for implementing the ledger in which data is stored across a network of decentralized nodes. By this, proof-based ledger has been maintained with transparency, traceability and security. DLT here used is based on trust design in mitigating the malicious activities of the financial stock marketing technology. Then using Bayesian theory based on the fault tolerance (BDLT_FT) model has been used in improving the efficiency of DLT and financial technology. This acts as the protocol which reduces energy consumption and enhance network scalability and security in digital transactions like cryptocurrency The financial data related to blockchain cryptocurrency were collected between the time period 2000 and 2020. The dataset of the stock market is evaluated under the fault tolerance model with statistical analysis. The statistical evaluation of financial data with developed BDLT_FT expressed that there is no association between the fault tolerance and the classification error.	blockchain;stock exchange market;financial technology;trust;dlt;bdltftchallenges;sector;price
499	技术治理	The Structural Role of Smart Contracts and Exchanges in the Centralisation of Ethereum-Based Cryptoassets	In this paper, we use the methods of networks science to analyse the transaction networks of tokens running on the Ethereum blockchain. We start with a deep dive on four of them: Ampleforth (AMP), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Dai (DAI) and Uniswap (UNI). We study two types of blockchain addresses, smart contracts (SC), which run code, and externally owned accounts (EOA), run by human users, or off-chain code, with the corresponding private keys. We use preferential attachment and network dismantling strategies to evaluate their importance for the network structure. Subsequently, we expand our view to all ERC-20 tokens issued on the Ethereum network. We first study multilayered networks composed of Ether (ETH) and individual tokens using a dismantling approach to assess how the deconstruction starting from one network affects the other. Finally, we analyse the Ether network and Ethereum-based token networks to find similarities between sets of high-degree nodes. For this purpose, we use both the traditional Jaccard Index and a new metric that we introduce, the Ordered Jaccard Index (OJI), which considers the order of the elements in the two sets that are compared. Our findings suggest that smart contracts and exchange-related addresses play a structural role in transaction networks both in DeFi and Ethereum. The presence in the network of nodes associated to addresses of smart contracts and exchanges is positively correlated with the success of the token network measured in terms of network size and market capitalisation. These nodes play a fundamental role in the centralisation of the supposedly decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem: without them, their networks would quickly collapse.	blockchain;ethereum;decentralised finance;network science;preferential attachment;network dismantlinginequality
500	核心技术	Attribute-Based Access Control Meets Blockchain-Enabled Searchable Encryption: A Flexible and Privacy-Preserving Framework for Multi-User Search	Searchable encryption enables users to enjoy search services while protecting the security and privacy of their outsourced data. Blockchain-enabled searchable encryption delivers the computing processes that are executed on the server to the decentralized and transparent blockchain system, which eliminates the potential threat of malicious servers invading data. Recently, although some of the blockchain-enabled searchable encryption schemes realized that users can search freely and verify search results, unfortunately, these schemes were inefficient and costly. Motivated by this, we proposed an improved scheme that supports fine-grained access control and flexible searchable encryption. In our framework, the data owner uploads ciphertext documents and symmetric keys to cloud database and optional KMS, respectively, and manipulates the access control process and searchable encryption process through smart contracts. Finally, the experimental comparison conducted on a private Ethereum network proved the superiority of our scheme.	smart contract;blockchain;searchable encryption;attribute-based access control smart contract;blockchain;searchable encryption;attribute-based access control
501	虚拟经济	Green Intelligence Networking for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles in Smart Cities	Advanced communication and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies facilitate the development of green smart cities. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are crucial components, which are aware of the environment by collecting data from sensors and modeling through AI to realize automatic decision-making. Intelligence networking enables each CAV to train appropriate models locally to learn how to drive in different environments, which can make up for the lack of experience of single-vehicle. However, model training and intelligence networking consume a lot of energy, calling on high-energy-efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT)-based green intelligence networking scheme (NGIN) for CAVs in smart cities. We use NFT to tokenize and describe intelligence by metadata, enabling applications to network intelligence efficiently, thereby reducing energy consumption. We present the architecture, modules, and efficient mechanisms of distributed intelligence networking. Moreover, we formulate the core problem as a discrete Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt the quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) algorithm to solve it. Also, the convergence rate and performance are evaluated. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	blockchains;training;computational modeling;smart cities;metadata;computer architecture;smart contracts;smart cities;green;intelligence networking;non-fungible token (nft)architecture;systems

First, we consider the rarity of an NFT based on the set of human-readable attributes it possesses and show that most collections present heterogeneous rarity patterns, with few rare NFTs and a large number of more common ones. Then, we analyze market performance and show that, on average, rarer NFTs: (i) sell for higher prices, (ii) are traded less frequently, (iii) guarantee higher returns on investment, and (iv) are less risky, i.e., less prone to yield negative returns. We anticipate that these findings will be of interest to researchers as well as NFT creators, collectors, and traders.

504	核心技术	Smart contracts vs incomplete contracts: A transaction cost economics viewpoint	Smart contracts (i.e., agreements enforced by a blockchain) are supposed to work at lower transaction costs than traditional (and incomplete) contracts that instead exploit a costly legal enforcement. This paper challenges that claim. I argue that because of the need for adaptation to mutable and unpredictable occurrences (a chief challenge of transaction cost economics a la Oliver Williamson), smart contracts may incur higher transaction costs than traditional contracts. This paper focuses on two problems related to the adaptation: first, smart contracts are constructed to limit and potentially avoid any ex-post legal intervention, including efficiency-enhancing adaptation by courts. Second, the consensus mechanism on which every smart contract depends may lead to additional transaction costs due to a majority-driven adaptation of the blockchain that follows Mancur Olson's Logic of groups. The paper further proposes several institutional expedients that may reduce these transaction costs of smart contracts. (C) 2022 Massimiliano Vatiero. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

505	核心技术	Application of blockchain smart contracts in smart tenancies: A Malaysian perspective	The advancement in blockchain technology has enabled smart contracts to automate the execution of tenancy obligations, known as "smart tenancies". This paper analyses the legal issues on the adoption of smart tenancies within Malaysia using legal doctrinal research method. We seek to answer these questions: (1) whether smart tenancies are enforceable in Malaysia; (2) whether parties to a smart tenancy can apply for an endorsement of tenancy under the National Land Code; (3) whether the legal profession can claim exclusivity in offering and maintaining smart tenancies services; and (4) whether there is room for self-help in resolving tenancy disputes using smart tenancies in Malaysia. The key findings are as follows: (1)(a) smart tenancies can and should be stamped when the user interface stipulates the information required for calculation of stamp duty; (1)(b) smart tenancies service provider have to comply with the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 to ensure that the system is reliable to attribute the electronic signatures to the contracting parties; (2) once the print-out of a smart tenancy is stamped, the tenant and landlord have an option to apply for endorsement of tenancy with the land registry under the National Land Code (Revised 2020); (3) the Legal Profession Act 1976 does not restrict the marketing, operation and maintenance of smart tenancies services to be done by law firms exclusively; and (4) there is no room for self-help eviction of a tenant in Malaysia, and the eviction process ought to be enforced with a court order.	blockchain smart contracts;smart tenancies;national land code;legal profession in malaysia;stamp dutieslaw

It is indispensable to authenticate devices in the IIoT environment. In this paper, we propose two blockchain-based authentication for IIoT devices with PUF. The first one relies on SRAM PUF, which is highly compatible with physical devices and has low cost. For the second one, we utilize the property of Arbiter PUF that it is difficult to physically clone but easy to be cloned mathematically to build the PUF models for authentication. We protect CRPs used for model training from leakage, and prevent PUF from being modeled twice. We formalize the security properties, and we prove that our proposal is secure. Besides, our proposal achieves scalability, which means that the entities involved in the scheme authenticate the devices instead of storing amounts of CRPs. Finally, we take SVM as an example to model PUF, and the implementation results demonstrate that the PUF model could achieve the accuracy of 99.9%. In addition, we implement smart contracts, and the implementation results confirm the availability of the protocol in the IIoT environment.	iiot;blockchain;puf;device authentication;data securitysecure;protocol;privacy;attacks

Our evidence supports the notion that sentiment plays a role in the investment decision-making process. Traders tend to realise positive returns when sentiment is bullish. Moreover, positive changes in the level of bullishness lead to traders executing larger trades, and a higher probability of depositing and withdrawing funds. Measures such as the degree of consensus within the online crowd, readership size and contributor reputation produce less compelling results, but offer some insights into Reddit community dynamics.	sentiment;cryptocurrency;decision making;retail traders;behavioural financeinformation-content;textual analysis;returns;investor;finance;tweets
508	市场治理	An application of a TVP-VAR extended joint connected approach to explore connectedness between WTI crude oil, gold, stock and cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 health crisis	We employ a time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) in combination with an extended joint connectedness approach to study interlinkages between four markets, namely the crude oil, gold, stock, and cryptocurrency markets, by characterizing the connectedness of these four markets, from January 1, 2018, to August 1, 2021. Our results demonstrate that health shocks appear to influence the system-wide dynamic connectedness, which reaches a peak during the COVID-19 pandemic. Net total directional connectedness sug-gests that the gold and stock markets consistently appear to be net receivers of spillover shocks. Crude oil appears to be a critical net transmitter of shocks for almost the whole pre-COVID-19 pandemic period, but it turns into an important net receiver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cryptocurrency market acts as the time-varying net receiver and net transmitter of our network, and it has the most inconsiderable role within our studied network. Pairwise connectedness reveals that crude oil and stock are mostly receiving spillover effects from all the other markets, while gold could be either a net transmitter or a net receiver, depending on the types of market considered. Cryptocurrency is a volatile market, and its role varies constantly over time.	gold price;covid-19 pandemic;cryptocurrency;oil prices;dynamic connectedness;joint connectednessvolatility spillover;efficient tests;safe haven;bitcoin;hedge;network;markets;return;garch
509	市场治理	Is Bitcoin a better hedging and safe-haven investment than traditional assets against currencies? Evidence from the time-frequency domain approach	Many studies have discussed hedges and safe havens against stocks, but few studies focus on the hedging/safe-haven performance of assets against the currency market over different time horizons. This paper studies the connectedness, hedging and safe-haven properties of Bitcoin/gold/ crude oil/commodities against six currencies across multiple investment horizons, placing a particular focus on the performance of these assets during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings suggest that the overall dependence between assets and the currency market is the strongest in the short term, and Bitcoin is the least dependent across all investment horizons. The dynamic relationships between the four assets and the currency market vary with timescales. Bitcoin offers better hedging capability in the long term and commodities emerge as the most favorable option for the optimal portfolio of currency over all time horizons. Further analysis shows that assets are better at helping investments reduce risk in the initial stages of the pandemic, and gold is an effective and robust safe haven for currencies.	bitcoin;currency;hedge;safe haven;time-frequency;covid-19volatility spillovers;gold;stocks;connectedness;markets;risk

511	市场治理	Role of big data analytics capabilities to improve sustainable competitive advantage of MSME service firms during COVID-19-A multi-theoretical approach	The extant literature suggests that digital technologies (big data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain) help firms gain a competitive advantage. However, the studies do not focus on the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector. Moreover, MSMEs face various challenges, including significant supply chain disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, there was an urgent requirement to shift to digital technologies to survive during this difficult time. In the context of MSME, various positive changes are discussed in the recent literature. However, a dearth of studies discusses the role of big data analytics capabilities (BDAC) to gain sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). Our study aims to fill this gap and answer this question - How do BDAC help MSMEs gain SCA? To understand the phenomenon, we receive theoretical support from organizational information processing theory (OIPT) and institutional theory (IT). We develop a conceptual framework that links BDAC and SCA through supply chain coordination, swift trust, and supply chain risk. Additionally, the age and size of the firm are used as control variables. The data is collected from Indian service sector employees of MSMEs, resulting in 497 usable responses. We use PLS-SEM using Warp PLS 7.0 to test the hypotheses. A critical finding is that the BDAC indirectly impacts the SCA. Finally, the other findings, limitations, and scope for future research are discussed.	supply chain disruption;supply chain coordination;big data analytics;sustainable competitive advantage;msme;service firmsoperations management research;supply chain;swift trust;predictive analytics;institutional theory;risk-management;performance;coordination;perspective;resilience

This article draws on signaling (Spence, 1973) and mechanism design theory (Hurwicz, 1973) to provide a theoretical un-derstanding of how voluntary disclosures and developers' activities mediate the relationship between platform decentralization and market value. We test our model with a sample of 682 largest market capitalization blockchain platforms. The results confirm our proposed mediation relationships that (1) centralization (or low decentralization) governance enhances platform market value via more voluntary disclosures, (2) decentral-ization enhances platform market value via facilitating developers' activities, and (3) centralization enhances market value via more voluntary disclosures that in turn facilitate developers' activities. Overall, our study offers both theoretical and practical implications regarding the governance structures that drive value for digital and blockchain platforms.	platform decentralization governance;platform market value;voluntary disclosures;developers' activities;signaling theory;mechanism design theory;blockchainvoluntary disclosure;project success;information;firm;competition;mediation;coevolution;ecosystems;strategies;ownership
513	市场治理	Herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market during COVID-19 pandemic: The role of media coverage	This paper examines herding behavior in the cryptocurrency market during the COVID-19 pandemic using daily data and based on static and regime-switching models. Furthermore, we investigate whether herding behavior is affected by the coronavirus media coverage. Based on a sample of the top-43 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization between 2013 and 2020, we find significant evidence of herding for the entire sample period only during high volatility state. Moreover, during the COVID-19 crisis, results suggest that investors in the cryptocurrency market follow the consensus. Finally, the impact of coronavirus media coverage is significant on herding among investors, explaining such behavior in the cryptocurrency market during the COVID-19 crisis. Our findings explain herding determinants that may help investors avoid such comportment, mainly during the crisis.	herding behaviour;cryptocurrencies;covid-19;media coverage;regime -switchingstock-market;bitcoin;volatility;oil
514	实体经济	Leveraging blockchain technology for green innovation in ecosystem-based business models: A dynamic capability of values appropriation	Stakeholders' pressure for environmental sustainability asks firms to develop ecosystem-based business models (EBMs) driven by a disruptive technology that strategically prioritizes green innovation. Given the infancy of the relevant issues, there is scarce empirical evidence addressing how blockchain technology (BT) as a typical disruptive technology triggers the formation of EBMs with higher levels of platformisation and stakeholder diversity. To address this need, from the dynamic capability view, we identify value appropriation capability (VAC) as a vital catalyst translating BT into realizing green innovation in EBMs. Our results indicate that BT and VAC positively affect green innovation performance, while VAC also mediates the BT-green innovation relationship in EBMs. The main contribution is to offer new insight into the mechanisms between disruptive technology and the evolution towards EBMs through the lens of a previously under-researched dynamic capability, VAC. We also provide feasible, practical guidance for organizations to inspire green innovation and establish sustainable EBMs.	disruptive technology;blockchain technology;ecosystem;business model;dynamic capability;value appropriationenvironmental responsibility;empirical-evidence;value creation;mediating role;performance;impact;drivers;growth;firms
515	实体经济	Agricultural traceability model based on IoT and Blockchain: Application in industrial hemp production	Facilities based on the Internet of Things and embedded systems along with the application of ambient intelligence paradigms offer new scenarios for optimization services in agronomic processes, specifically in the hemp industry. The traceability of products and activities demonstrates the scope of these technologies. However, the technologies themselves introduce integration-related problems that can affect the planned benefits. This article proposes a model that balances agricultural expert knowledge (user-centered design), value chain planning (through blockchain implementation), and digital technology (Internet of Things protocols) for providing tamper proof, transparent, and secure traceability in this agricultural sector. The proposed approach is backed by a proof-of-concept implementation in a realist scenario, using embedded devices and a permissioned blockchain. The model and its deployment fully integrate a set of services that other proposals only partially integrate. On one hand, the design creates a permissioned blockchain that contemplates the different actors in the value chain, and on the other hand, it develops services that use applications with human-machine interfaces. Finally, it deploys a network of embedded devices with Internet of Things protocols and control algorithms with automated access to the blockchain for traceability services. Combining digital systems with interoperable human tasks it has been possible to deploy a model that provides a new approach for the development of value-added services.	blockchain;iot;industrial hemp;tamper proof tech;traceability
516	虚拟经济	Impacts of COVID-19 on global stock sectors: Evidence from time-varying connectedness and asymmetric nexus analysis	In this paper, we analyze the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on global stock sectors from two perspectives. First, to measure the effect of the COVID-19 on the volatility connectedness among global stock sectors in the time-frequency domain, we combine the time-varying connectedness and frequency connectedness method and focus on the total, directional, and net connectedness. The empirical results indicate a dramatic rise in the total connectedness among the global stock sectors following the outbreak of COVID-19. However, the high level of the total connectedness lasted only about two months, representing that the impact of COVID-19 is significant but not durable. Furthermore, we observe that the directional and net connectedness changes of different stock sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic are heterogeneous, and the diverse possible driving factors. In addition, the transmission of spillovers among sectors is driven mainly by the highfrequency component (short-term spillovers) during the full sample time. However, the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak also persisted in the long term. Second, we explore how the changing COVID-19 pandemic intensity (represented by the daily new COVID-19 confirmed cases and the daily new COVID-19 death cases worldwide) affect the daily returns of the global stock sectors by using the Quantile-on-Quantile Regression (QQR) methodology of Sim and Zhou (2015). The results indicate the different characteristics in responses of the stock sectors to the pandemic intensity. Specifically, most sectors are severely impacted by the COVID-19. In contrast, some sectors (Necessary Consume and Medical & Health) that are least affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (especially in the milder stage of the COVID-19 pandemic) are those that are related to the provision of goods and services which can be considered as necessities and substitutes. These results also hold after several robustness checks. Our findings may help understand the sectoral dynamics in the global stock market and provide significant implications for portfolio managers, investors, and government agencies in times of highly stressful events like the COVID19 crisis.	covid-19;stock sectors;time -varying connectedness;asymmetric nexus;quantile-on-quantile regressionenergy-consumption;growth nexus;uncertainty;regression;bitcoin;market;panel;risk;oil

518	核心技术	Incentive Assignment in Hybrid Consensus Blockchain Systems in Pervasive Edge Environments	Edge computing is becoming pervasive in our daily lives with emerging smart devices and the development of communication technology. Smart devices with various resources make data transactions prevalent over edge environments. To ensure such transactions are unmodifiable and undeniable, blockchain technology is introduced into edge environments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain system to enhance the security for transactions and determine the incentive for miners in edge computing environments. We propose a Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) hybrid consensus blockchain system utilizing the heterogeneity of devices to adapt to the characteristic of edge environments. We raise the incentive assignment problem for a fair incentive to PoW miners. We formulate the problem and propose an iterative and another heuristic algorithm to determine the incentive that the miner will receive for a new block. We further prove that the iterative algorithm can obtain global optimal results. Simulation and experiment results show that our proposed algorithm can give a reasonable incentive to miners under different system parameters in edge blockchain systems.	blockchains;security;edge computing;smart devices;proof of work;privacy;heuristic algorithms;pervasive edge computing;hybrid blockchain;proof of work;proof of stake;incentive mechanism
519	实体经济	Accountable attribute-based authentication with fine-grained access control and its application to crowdsourcing	We introduce a new notion called accountable attribute-based authentication with fine-grained access control (AccABA), which achieves (i) fine-grained access control that prevents ineligible users from authenticating; (ii) anonymity such that no one can recognize the identity of a user; (iii) public accountability, i.e., as long as a user authenticates two different messages, the corresponding authentications will be easily identified and linked, and anyone can reveal the user's identity without any help from a trusted third party. Then, we formalize the security requirements in terms of unforgeability, anonymity, linkability and traceability, and give a generic construction to fulfill these requirements. Based on AccABA, we further present the first attribute-based, fair, anonymous and publicly traceable crowdsourcing scheme on blockchain, which is designed to filter qualified workers to participate in tasks, and ensures the fairness of the competition between workers, and finally balances the tension between anonymity and accountability.	fine-grained access control;anonymous authentication;accountability;fairness;crowdsourcing;blockchainanonymous credentials;signatures
520	实体经济	An Implementation of Fake News Prevention by Blockchain and Entropy-based Incentive Mechanism	Fake news is undoubtedly a significant threat to democratic countries nowadays because existing technologies can quickly and massively produce fake videos, articles, or social media messages based on the rapid development of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Therefore, human assistance is critical if current fake news prevention systems desire to improve accuracy. Given this situation, prior research has proposed to add a quorum, a group of appraisers trusted by users to verify the authenticity of digital content, to the fake news prevention systems. This paper proposes an entropy-based incentive mechanism to diminish the negative effect of malicious behaviors on a quorum-based fake news prevention system. In order to maintain the Safety and Liveness of our system, we employed entropy to measure the degree of voting disagreement to determine appropriate rewards and penalties. To the best of our knowledge, we believe this is the first proposed work to leverage entropy in a fake news prevention system. Moreover, we use Hyperledger Fabric, Schnorr signatures, and human appraisers to implement a practical prototype of a quorum-based fake news prevention system. Then we conduct necessary case analyses and experiments to realize how dishonest participants, crash failures, and scale impact our system. The outcomes of the case analyses and experiments show that our mechanisms are feasible and provide an analytical basis for developing fake news prevention systems. Furthermore, we have added six innovative contributions in this extension work compared to our previous workshop paper in DEVIANCE 2021.	proof of stake;security;deviance;social network;social media
521	协同技术	Resource Allocation and Consensus of Blockchains in Pervasive Edge Computing Environments	Edge devices with sensing, storage, and communication resources are penetrating our daily lives. These resources make it possible for edge devices to conduct data transactions (e.g., micro-payments, micro-access control). The blockchain technology can be used to ensure transaction unmodifiable and undeniable. In this paper, we propose a blockchain system that adapts to the limitations of edge devices. The new blockchain system can fairly and efficiently allocate storage resources on edge devices, which makes it scalable. We find the optimal peer nodes for transaction data storage and propose a recent block storage allocation scheme for quick retrieval of missing blocks. We develop data migration algorithms to dynamically reallocate data and block storage to adapt topology changes in the network. The proposed blockchain system can also reach consensus with low energy consumption in edge devices with a new Proof of Stake mechanism. Extensive simulations show that our proposed blockchain system works efficiently in edge environments. On average, the new system uses 18.4 percent less time and consumes 87 percent less battery power when compared with traditional blockchain systems.	blockchain;resource management;distributed databases;edge computing;peer-to-peer computing;reliability;metadata;pervasive edge computing;blockchain;proof of stake
522	协同技术	Privacy protection federated learning system based on blockchain and edge computing in mobile crowdsourcing	With the rapid popularization and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G networks, mobile crowdsourcing (MCS) has become an indispensable part in today's society. However, when task participants submit tasks, they are likely to expose their data privacy and location privacy. These privacy will be maliciously attacked and exploited by attackers (external attackers and untrusted third party). With the rapid increase of MCS data throughput, traditional cloud platforms can no longer meet the huge data processing needs. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an MCS federated learning system based on Blockchain and edge computing. This paper uses federated learning as the framework of the MCS system. The system protects data privacy and location privacy by using the Double local disturbance Localized Differential Privacy (DLD-LDP) proposed in this paper. Because the sensed data exists in multiple modalities (text, video, audio, etc.), this paper uses the Multi-modal Transformer (MulT) method to merge the multi-modal data before subsequent operations. To solve the problem that the third party is untrusted, we utilize Blockchain to distribute tasks and collect models in a distributed way. A reputation calculation method (Sig-RCU) is proposed to calculate the real-time reputation of task participants. Through conducting experiments on real data sets, the effectiveness and adaptation of the proposed DLD-LDP algorithm and Sig-RCU algorithm are verified.	mobile crowdsourcing;privacy protection;blockchain;edge computing;federated learning;localized differential privacyincentive mechanism;aggregation
523	核心技术	SynergyChain: A Multichain-Based Data-Sharing Framework With Hierarchical Access Control	With customization of demands and functionalities, diverse blockchain systems are integrated with IoT in different application scenarios, forming a multichain environment. Multichain interoperability has become a crucial emerging issue, i.e., different blockchain systems are difficult to interact with each other credibly and efficiently. It further leads to isolated data islands across multichain. Therefore, it is of significant importance to facilitate data sharing among multichain systems. Toward achieving this, there are two main challenges. First, data across multiple blockchains must be shared reliably to meet the tamper-proof merits of blockchain technology. Second, we must control the data access process in a fine-grained way to protect sensitive data and user privacy. This article proposes SynergyChain, a multichain framework to enable reliable data sharing with controllable data access. By aggregating the data from multiple blockchains and reorganizing it in SynergyChain, we can achieve data reliability with the verification. Meanwhile, SynergyChain provides hierarchical access control based on smart contracts, making access control automated and credible. Experiments show that SynergyChain can support data sharing reliably and efficiently and reduce data query latency compared with multichain data requesting sequentially.	blockchain;access control;reliability;internet of things;data privacy;smart contracts;process control;access control;blockchain;data sharing;smart contract
524	核心技术	Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving and Rewarding Private Data Sharing for IoT	The Internet of Things (IoT) devices possessed by individuals produce massive amounts of data. The private data onto specific IoT devices can be combined with intelligent platform to provide help for future research and prediction. As an important digital asset, individuals can sell private data to get rewards. Problems, such as privacy, security, and access control prevent individuals from sharing their private data. The blockchain technology is widely used to build an anonymous trading system. In this article, we construct a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and rewarding private data-sharing scheme (BPRPDS) for IoT. A privacy issue worth considering is that the malicious cloud server may establish a behavior profile database of data users (DUs). In the case of anonymity, the transactions of private data sharing are easy to cause disputes. When anonymous DUs are framed, it is hard to protect their rights. With the help of the deniable ring signature and Monero, we realize the behavior profile building prevention and nonframeability of BPRPDS. At the same time, we utilize the licensing technology executed by smart contracts to ensure flexible access control of multisharing. The proposed BPRPDS is provably secure. Performance analysis and experimental results show that BPRPDS is efficient and practical.	blockchains;security;data privacy;smart contracts;access control;internet of things;servers;anonymity;blockchain;data sharing;ring signaturedigital rights management;ring signature;efficient;secure;scheme;framework;system

526	实体经济	Integrating Lean Six Sigma with blockchain technology for quality management - a scoping review of current trends and future prospects	Purpose The purpose of this research is to study and analyze the literature that integrates Lean Six Sigma (LSS) approach with blockchain technology in different sectors for improved quality management. Design/methodology/approach This study presents a scoping review on the application of integrated LSS and blockchain technology in the manufacturing and healthcare sector. Further, the authors examined existing blockchain-based solutions on a variety of dimensions, including application area, technical approach, methodology, application scenario, various blockchain platforms, purpose, and monitoring parameters. The authors study LSS approaches in detail, as well as the key benefits that blockchain technology can enable. Finally, the authors discuss significant research problems to be addressed in order to develop a highly efficient, resilient, and secure quality management framework using blockchain technology. Findings It has been observed that the adoption of blockchain technology for quality management and assurance is influenced by several factors such as transaction execution speed, throughput, latency. Also, prior blockchain-based solutions have neglected to leverage the benefits of LSS methodologies for effective quality management. Originality/value This is the first study to explores the influence of blockchain technology on quality management and assurance in manufacturing and healthcare industry. Furthermore, prior research has not examined how integrating the LSS methodology with blockchain technology can aid in the control of product quality management.	blockchain;supply chain management;product quality;lean six sigma;security;ethereumtraceability;framework
527	协同技术	CrowdHB: A Decentralized Location Privacy-Preserving Crowdsensing System Based on a Hybrid Blockchain Network	With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), crowdsensing, as a new emerging application of the IoT that employs ubiquitous mobile users with smartphones for data collection and processing, has further deepened our knowledge. However, the problems of the current crowdsensing systems regarding system security, user privacy, and user payment (UP) raise serious privacy and security concerns, which affect participants' adoption of the system. The Blockchain technology allows for nondeterministic multiple parties to interact with each other anonymously in a network that is not fully trusted. In this article, we propose a new decentralized crowdsensing system, called CrowdHB. Unlike other blockchain-based crowdsensing systems, CrowdHB adopts a hybrid blockchain architecture and uses smart contracts to achieve location privacy preservation and ensure data quality while improving the system performance. Furthermore, to optimize task assignments to mobile users, we propose a location privacy-preserving optimization mechanism (LPPOM) and the approach of consistency optimization (ACO) to achieve a tradeoff between user privacy and system performance. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed CrowdHB outperforms the other crowdsensing systems in terms of task success rate and performance for a large number of mobile users and tasks.	crowdsensing;privacy;blockchain;task analysis;security;internet of things;optimization;consistency;crowdsensing;hybrid blockchain;internet of things (iot);location privacy preservationframework
528	协同技术	Challenges in making blockchain privacy compliant for the digital world: some measures	Due to the pandemic, most of the personal transactions relating to finance, commerce and healthcare services have gone online making privacy preservation a critical requirement. Consequently, privacy has been made a critical parameter in Data Protection Regulations leading to the search for such a privacy compliant system which is also resilient to attacks. A detailed analysis of the Blockchain technology, which is becoming popular for secure applications in the finance sector, indicates that there are several challenges relating to user identity, transaction linkability, crypto-keys management, data privacy, usability, interoperability, and post- quantum compliance of privacy regulations which need to be resolved before its widespread adoption. Being a decentralised system, there is a need to analyse the vulnerability to attacks of each layer in the Blockchain architecture. This paper discusses the development flow of some of the privacy enhancement mechanisms like ZKPs, SMPC, Ring signatures, Mixing, Homomorphic Encryption and quantum resilient computing, bringing out their features and lacunae. There is a detailed discussion of the privacy mechanisms adopted by blockchain platforms like ZCash, Zerocoin, Hyperledger, Wanchain, Coin Party, Monero, Cryptomate, MixCoin, Coinshuffle, PICNIC and New Hope. Every platform has some limitation or the other and it is essential that researchers come out with mitigation steps for the existing mechanisms and come up with improved new Privacy Enhancement Techniques. One such architecture using PET has been proposed.	privacy;blockchain;zero knowledge proof;ring signature;multiparty computation;mixing;homomorphic encryption;quantum computing;petsecurity
529	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Internet-of-Things for Secure Transmission of Medical Data in Rural Areas	Patients' medical data are extremely sensitive information during storage and transfer, and it needs the highest security level. Furthermore, these records must frequently be linked to patient medical data, and then the linked medical data are securely transmitted to the healthcare center. In this study, a Blockchain-Based Traceable Data Sharing method is proposed to securely transfer the medical data. A Paillier homomorphic encryption method is used to prevent data theft or attacks from occurring in the cloud as a result of the transfer of medical data there. It prevents intravenous third parties, which executes arithmetic operations on the ciphertext. Then the encrypted data are stored in the cloud and to remove clone nodes in the gateway, a software-defined networking technology is introduced. Then a Blockchain-Based Traceable Data Sharing is proposed to ensure data privacy and authenticity while maintaining data privacy at the point of data transmission. Data are then encrypted using a new Enhanced Cipher Text-Policy Encryption Attribute-based Encryption (E-CP-ABE). Private blockchain transfers are carried out on the chain, supporting fine-grain access control with flexible access policies and creating a private key in E-CP-ABE. The presented technique is executed in Matlab software of version R2020a. The performance parameters are encryption, and decryption time, mean square error (MSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), sensitivity, respectively. The encryption process function is nearly 8% superior than the existing methods and the decryption time is 14% greater than other methods. As a result, this study shows that the research approach outperformed in terms of encryption time and decryption time, as well as PSNR, MSE, and sensitivity. This technique outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of imperceptibility and robustness against various attacks. Consequently, this approach is more reliable than previous methods for the transmission of medical data.	healthcare data;paillier homomorphic encryption system;software-defined networking technological (sdn);blockchain-based traceable data sharing;secure transmission;enhanced cipher text-policy encryption attribute-based encryptionchallenges;issues
530	实体经济	A new blockchain and fog computing model for blood pressure medical sensor data storage	The healthcare business can benefit from the Internet of Things (IoT) in terms of data manage-ment and transfer. Patient health data can be acquired locally from devices that can be used to make real-time decisions based on the data. For many years, several hospitals have deployed IoT in their patient rooms and their body parts. IoT devices could be vulnerable to hacking due to a lack of authentication and encryption policies, posing serious hazards to consumers. As a result, blockchain is useful for securing and proving transactions in the IoT. As a result, it is proposed that the problem be solved using Fog Computing (FGC), Edge Computing, and blockchain. Based on FGC technology, models of analysis, and a signature-encryption algorithm (SE), a three-tiered architecture is employed for the identification, verification, and identification of healthcare IoT devices. The generated findings are used to assess the suggested innovative SE algorithm. We discovered that FGC-based blockchain performed better for detecting malicious nodes in terms of packet error rate, reliability, and throughput when compared to cloud settings and other environments.	blockchain;cloud computing;fog computing;patient health record;security;internet of thingsiot;internet;scheme;system
531	协同技术	A Decentralized Location-Based Reputation Management System in the IoT Using Blockchain	The Internet of Things (IoT) allows an object to connect to the Internet and observe or interact with a physical phenomenon. The communication technologies allow one IoT device to discover and communicate with another in order to exchange services, in a similar way to what humans do in their social networks. Knowing the reputation of another device is important to consider whether it is trustworthy before establishing a new connection and thus, avoid possible unexpected behaviors as a consequence. Trustworthiness, as a property of a device, can be affected by different factors including its geographical location. Hence, this research work proposes an architecture to manage reputation values of end devices in an IoT system based on the area where they are located. A cloud-fog-edge architecture is proposed, where the fog layer uses the Blockchain technology to keep the reputation management system consistent and fault tolerant across different nodes. The location-based part of the system was done by storing geographical areas in smart contracts (coined as geospatial smart contracts) and making the reputation values subject to different regions depending on the geographical location of the device. To reduce the complexity of the spatial computation, the geographical data are geocoded by either one of two different spatial indexing techniques. This work also introduced two different structures for storing geocoded areas based on either cell list or tree structure. Finally, three experiments to test the proposed architecture are presented, to deploy the architecture in IoT devices, and to compare the two geocoding techniques in smart contracts.	computer architecture;blockchains;cloud computing;internet of things;smart contracts;indexing;geospatial analysis;blockchain;internet of things (iot);location-based trust;spatial indexingtrust
532	协同技术	Interoperability approaches of blockchain technology for supply chain systems	Purpose This work focuses on the interoperability of the blockchain from the viewpoint of its technological evolution in the wider context of supply chain systems. Interoperability concerns the most since it is among the most persevering problems in the process of blockchain adaptation. The study aims to trace and pinpoint all the different methods that affect the interoperability of blockchains, gather all the obtainable evidence and recognize gaps in between the applicable approaches mentioned across the contemporary academic literature. Design/methodology/approach An analysis is done of seven interoperability approaches based on their relevance, practical usefulness and adoption processes concerning the blockchain. Mainly, this work examines interoperability from several different perspectives. An interoperability modular decomposition via a layered model has been defined through the level of conceptual interoperability (LCIM) and level of information system interoperability (LISI), which represent the most popular metrics with regard to assessing the level of interoperability from a qualitative level. Findings Generally, the findings of this work are directed in two major aspects: Firstly, it expands the research around blockchain technology interoperability by providing crucial background information and pinpointing important connotations for both industrial and academic environments. It also defines and analyzes several different approaches toward the blockchain platform's interoperability. Secondly, it also identifies and proposes several scenarios that take advantage of multiple blockchain application approaches, highlights various issues and challenges to the evolution of interoperability standards and solutions and indicates the desired areas of further research.

533	市场治理	From money to culture: The practical indeterminacy of Bitcoin's values and temporalities	Bitcoin, regarded as a decentralized currency of the future as well as a digital gold, faces various challenges, such as scalability, the geographical concentration of mining, its politically informed design and history, its high market volatility, and inequalities in the proportion of accumulation. However, the number of Bitcoin owners has risen exponentially, and relevant socioeconomic and political groups have become increasingly diverse. Consequently, this article argues that what has contributed to the global diffusion of Bitcoin and its embeddedness in different human societies is its practical indeterminacy. Practical indeterminacy characterizes the fundamentally undefinable, indeterminate nature of Bitcoin's value, as it can change its form depending on who it encounters. In terms of temporality, practically indeterminate Bitcoin can urge potential owners and users to compare their pasts and futures, thus driving them to perceive, own, and use Bitcoin for their own purposes. By paying attention to the agency of Bitcoin, practical indeterminacy explains how individuals form their own relations with Bitcoin and how these relations lead to Bitcoin's further sociocultural embeddedness. The proliferation of such a wide range of human-Bitcoin relations shows that Bitcoin is not only monetary but also cultural, as it offers different meanings to users and owners.	bitcoin;money;practical indeterminacy;temporality;digital anthropologycryptocurrencies
534	技术治理	Data Fusion Approach for Collaborative Anomaly Intrusion Detection in Blockchain-Based Systems	Blockchain technology is rapidly changing the transaction behavior and efficiency of businesses in recent years. Data privacy and system reliability are critical issues that is highly required to be addressed in Blockchain environments. However, anomaly intrusion poses a significant threat to a Blockchain, and therefore, it is proposed in this article a collaborative clustering-characteristic-based data fusion approach for intrusion detection in a Blockchain-based system, where a mathematical model of data fusion is designed and an AI model is used to train and analyze data clusters in Blockchain networks. The abnormal characteristics in a Blockchain data set are identified, a weighted combination is carried out, and the weighted coefficients among several nodes are obtained after multiple rounds of mutual competition among clustering nodes. When the weighted coefficient and a similarity matching relationship follow a standard pattern, an abnormal intrusion behavior is accurately and collaboratively detected. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high recognition accuracy and promising performance in the real-time detection of attacks in a Blockchain.	blockchain;intrusion detection;security;data models;clustering algorithms;anomaly detection;analytical models;blockchain;data fusion;intrusion detection;similarity matching;weighted combinationindustrial internet;smart card;combination;consensus;scheme
535	实体经济	Cultural roadblocks? Acceptance of blockchain-based hotel booking among individualistic and collectivistic travelers	Purpose Blockchain technology is predicted to revolutionize the tourism and hospitality industry through peer-to-peer hotel bookings with little or no involvement of intermediaries. Outstanding features of this technology are its distributed form of storing data, its collaborative way of identifying the "true state" of a system and the immutability of data. These features may lead to a perceived loss of controllability among travelers. Based on the Agentic Theory of Human Behavior, the purpose of this study is to propose that this assumed loss of control matters more to travelers with an individualistic rather than a collectivistic predisposition. Design/methodology/approach In two studies (n = 475 and n = 196) using verbal scenarios, this study manipulates the perceived controllability of a blockchain-enabled hotel booking app by varying the number of additional services linked to the app. This study tests for the interaction of controllability with individual-level measures of individualistic versus collectivistic (I-C) predisposition. Findings Collectivistic travelers are more willing than individualistic travelers to use blockchain technology for their hotel bookings. This effect can be mitigated by offering additional services that give individualistic travelers an enhanced sense of "being in control". Practical implications Blockchain-enabled applications facilitating direct hotel bookings without any additional intermediary services are more readily accepted by travelers with a collectivistic mindset. Blockchain applications addressing individualistic travelers require added services that establish a sense of controllability. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the interaction of I-C predisposition with perceived controllability in tourism and hospitality. Furthermore, it is the first in the technology-acceptance literature to test this interaction using individual-level measures of I-C predisposition and an experimental manipulation of perceived controllability.	blockchain;culture;individualistic;collectivistic;self-construal;technology acceptance;controllability;agentic theory of human behaviortechnology adoption;behavior;impact;information;nonresponse;perspective;extension;framework;values;model
536	实体经济	Blockchain-Inspired Secure Computation Offloading in a Vehicular Cloud Network	With the emergence of computation-intensive vehicular applications, computation offloading based on mobile-edge computing (MEC) has become a promising paradigm in resource-constrained vehicular cloud networks (VCNs). However, when doing computation offloading in a VCN, malicious service providers can cause serious security concerns on the content offloading. To address that in this article, a blockchain-based secure computation offloading scheduling scheme is proposed. It embraces the blockchain-based trust management paradigm and smart contract-enabled deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. As for the trust management, the long-term reputation and short-term trust variability are jointly considered. Specifically, a novel three-valued subjective logic (3VSL) scheme is adopted to obtain a more comprehensive reputation, and the statistics of behavioral transitions can provide a short-term trust variability to timely capture the malicious behaviors. In addition, to securely update, validate, and store the trust information, we propose a hierarchical blockchain framework that comprises vehicular blockchain, roadside unit (RSU) blockchain, and cloud blockchain. Furthermore, a smart contract-enabled DRL algorithm is proposed to implement the secure and intelligent computation offloading scheduling in a VCN. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.	blockchain;trust management;smart contracts;computational modeling;task analysis;cloud computing;wireless communication;blockchain;computation offloading;deep reinforcement learning (drl);reputation;smart contract;vehicular cloud networks (vcns)trust

538	核心技术	A Cross-Layer Trust-Based Consensus Protocol for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Using Fuzzy Logic	Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading platforms are being actively designed, tested, and operated by engineers, power distribution companies, and prosumers. The assurance of the accountability of the conduct of different stakeholders through a robust trust management mechanism is imperative in such platforms. The usage of blockchain, as an underlying technology, can ensure numerous properties, such as immutability, transparency, and traceable execution of transactions, in addition to ensuring trust establishment among different entities of the system. Few blockchain-based decentralized energy trading platforms have been designed in the literature to build trust about the platform and among prosumers. However, none of these proposals have considered human-in-the-loop in the trust establishment process. Moreover, these solutions have considered trust only at a particular layer of the blockchain, such as at the application or consensus layer. To bridge this gap, this article presents a novel cross-layer trust-based consensus protocol that considers human-in-the-loop and employs fuzzy logic to address the issue of vagueness of trust values by offering human interpretable trust level. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed protocol in comparison to established consensus mechanisms. The analysis also shows the protocol is immune against selfish mining, 51% and Sybil attacks.	peer-to-peer computing;internet of things;consensus protocol;cryptography;proposals;fuzzy logic;task analysis;blockchain;cross-layer;energy trading;fuzzy logic;trust
539	实体经济	Blockchain technology: a catalyst for reverse logistics of the automobile industry	Purpose In recent times, reverse logistics (RL) is gaining significant traction in various automobile industries to recapture returned vehicles' value. A good RL program can lower manufacturing costs, establish a green supply chain, enhance customer satisfaction and provide a competitive advantage. However, reducing disruptions and increasing operational efficiency in the automobile RL requires implementing innovative technology to improve information flow and security. Thus, this manuscript aims to examine the hurdles in automobile RL activities and how they can be effectively tackled by blockchain technology (BCT). Merging BCT and RL provides the entire automobile industry a chance to generate value for its consumers through effective vehicle return policies, manufacturing cost reduction, maintenance records tracking, administration of vehicle information and a clear payment record of insurance contracts. Design/methodology/approach This research is presented in three stages to accomplish the task. First, previous literature and experts' opinions are examined to highlight certain factors that are an aggravation to BCT implementation. Next, this study proposed an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) - decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with Choquet integral framework for computing and analyzing the comparative results of factor interrelationships. Finally, the causal outline diagrams are plotted to determine the influence of factors on one another for BCT implementation in automobile RL. Findings This study has categorized the barriers to BCT implementation into five major factors - operational and strategical, technical, knowledge and behavioral, financial and infrastructural, and government rules and regulations. The results revealed that disreputable technology, low-bearing capacity of IT systems and operational inefficiency are the most significant factors to be dealt with by automobile industry professionals for finer and enhanced RL processes utilizing BCT. The most noticeable advantage of BCT is its enormous amount of data, permitting automobile RL to develop client experience through real-time data insights. Practical implications This study reveals several factors that are hindering the implementation of BCT in RL activities of the automobile industry. The results can assist experts and policymakers improve their existing decision-making systems while making an effort to implement BCT into the automobile industry's RL activities. Originality/value Although there are several studies on the benefits of BCT in RL and the adoption of BCT in the automobile industry, individually, none have explicated the use of BCT in automobile RL. This is also the first kind of study that has used IVIFS-DEMATEL with the Choquet integral framework for computing and analyzing the comparative results of factor interrelationships hindering BCT implementation in automobile RL activities.	supply chain management;reverse logistics;automobile industry;industry 4;0;blockchain technology;distributed ledgerintuitionistic fuzzy-sets;decision-making;data-management;dematel method;challenges;framework;barriers;perspectives;architecture;strategy
540	实体经济	A trust-based mechanism for drones in smart cities	Smart cities equipped with intelligent devices can enhance the lifestyle and quality of humans by automatically and collaboratively acting as a sustainable resource to the ecosystem. In addition, the technological advancement can be further empowered by interconnecting various types of technologies, such as IoT, Artificial Intelligence, drones and robotics which will clearly improve the Quality of Services, energy efficiency and connectivity to the overall system. The integration of drones hovering over smart cities with the other devices in the smart city network brings a lot of benefits. However, it can also lead to various security and privacy concerns in the network. The aim of this article is to put forward a secure and safe smart city communication environment by proposing a trust establishment scheme for the ad hoc Unmanned Aerial Vehicles network. In which, malicious devices can be traced and blocked by analysing and evaluating their historical interactions within the system and calculating their trust values. A behaviour-based and local trust value scheme is used to analyse the trust of each communicating device that is further associated with a blockchain distributed ledger. The proposed mechanism is measured over various networking and security metrics, including throughput, latency, accuracy and block updating compared to the existing state-of-the-art solutions.	computer network security;information security and privacy;iot and mobile communications;smart cities applicationssecurity;challenges
541	核心技术	The Use of Blockchain to Support Distributed AI Implementation in IoT Systems	This article presents a distributed and decentralized architecture for the implementation of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) using hardware platforms provided by the Internet of Things (IoT). A trained DAI system has been implemented over IoT, where each IoT device acts as one or more of the neurons within the DAI layers. This is accomplished by the utilization of decentralized, self-managed blockchain technologies that allow trusted interactions and information to be exchanged between distributed neurons. The platform was built and customized to be used within the IoT system, and it is capable of handling DAI-related tasks. A new consensus mechanism based on Proof of Authority (PoA) and Proof of Work (PoW) has been designed and implemented, along with bespoke block and transaction formats. The proposed architecture was analyzed, implemented, and tested using a dedicated testbed with low-cost IoT devices. A quantitative measurement and performance evaluation of the system based on a real-world IoT application was conducted. The implemented DAI is found to have an accuracy of 92%-98%, with an energy cost of 0.12 joules (J) when utilizing a Raspberry Pi to run one neuron. The measured hash per joule (h/J) when using a Raspberry Pi for mining is 13.8 Kh/J compared to 54 Kh/J using an ESP32. The results showed that it is feasible to implement a DAI system utilizing the IoT hardware platform while maintaining the system's accuracy. The integration of the blockchain has added an element of security and trust to the data and the interaction between system components.	blockchain;artificial intelligence;internet of things;cloud computing;computer architecture;distributed databases;data mining;blockchain;consensus mechanisms;distributed artificial intelligence (dai);internet of things (iot);performance evaluation
542	协同技术	Trustworthy Blockchain-Empowered Collaborative Edge Computing-as-a-Service Scheduling and Data Sharing in the IIoE	Owing to the technology of 5G and beyond, collaborative edge computing-as-a-service has enabled trillions of interconnected edge applications. It has also become a prospective paradigm for providing computing services by offloading computationally intensive assignments to mobile-edge servers or fog nodes due to terminals constrained computing and caching resources. Nevertheless, in this process, trust of computing-as-a-service scheduling and edge data sharing in heterogeneous systems is an unavoidable challenge of paramount importance. As a powerful tool that addresses security issues, blockchains can ensure the trustworthiness and irreversibility of computing data by consensus mechanisms. However, in the Industrial Internet of Energy (IIoE), the storage burden of a single blockchain has increased. Therefore, from the perspective of a stable real-time operation, we propose a multiedgechain structure that accommodates thousands of edge data and promotes on-chain data efficiency to achieve cross-chain edge data sharing for heterogeneous blockchain systems. Moreover, aiming at the profits of computing resource scheduling in the IIoE, a two-stage Stackelberg game strategy with an optimal scheduling demand and reward is provided considering the edge user's preferences and risk factors. Finally, the simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed scheme, regarding the game equilibrium, utility optimization, and data sharing efficiency of cloud-edge collaboration.	blockchain;processor scheduling;job shop scheduling;games;edge computing;task analysis;cloud computing;blockchain;cross-chain;edge computing;industrial internet of energy (iioe);noncooperative gamesresource-allocation;industrial internet;scheme;5g
543	协同技术	Self-stabilizing c-wave algorithms for arbitrary networks	In this paper, we propose the first self-stabilizing c-wave algorithm for broadcasting large size messages from multiple initiator processes such that every process receives at least one of these messages broadcast by the initiators. The proposed algorithm first splits each message into a sequence of message shares and then broadcasts the message shares in a pipelined manner in order. We then present an improved maximally concurrent self-stabilizing c-wave algorithm called dynamic clusteringc-wavealgorithm that constructs dynamic broadcast trees by allowing a process to dynamically change its parent to a neighbouring process with the most message shares to implement a maximally concurrent broadcasting of large size messages. The improved algorithm is maximally concurrent in the sense that a process is allowed to receive a message share from any neighbouring process with a larger sequence of message shares than its current parent from which it receives message shares in the broadcast trees constructed by the initiators when available. We implemented and experimentally evaluated the c-wave algorithm to compare its message propagation delay to those of the m and the k-wave algorithms. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the broadcast propagation delays compared to that of the m and the k-wave algorithms. The improvement is more evident over the m-wave algorithm. Solutions to global-snapshots, distributed broadcast and various synchronization problems can be solved efficiently using c-wave algorithms. In addition, the proposed algorithms have applications in blockchain, mobile wireless sensor networks, VANETs and military communication networks.	c-wave;distributed computing;multi-node broadcast;m-wave;self-stabilization;wave algorithmsindependent spanning-trees;time synchronization;node;spite
544	核心技术	On the use of generic types for smart contracts	This paper shows that generic types (generics) are useful for writing more abstract and more general smart contracts, but this comes with some security risks, reporting a concrete security issue found while using generics for writing smart contracts that implement shared entities for the Hotmoka blockchain. That issue can be used to steal the remuneration of validator nodes. This paper proposes a patch based on appropriate code rewriting. Namely, smart contracts are pieces of code that are deployed and executed in the context of a blockchain infrastructure in order to automatically enforce some effects when particular events occur. The writing of smart contracts is a complex and critical activity that can benefit from the use of high-level features of programming languages, and generics is one of them. In many programming languages, such as Java, generics are implemented by erasure, i.e. replaced by their upper bound type during compilation into bytecode. This is safe at source level, since the compiler takes care of checking that types are correct, before erasure. However, the erased types of the generated bytecode are consequently weaker. In a permissionless blockchain, where every user can call the bytecode of smart contracts installed by other users, these weaker types pose a risk of attack.	smart contracts;generics;erasure
545	核心技术	Learning Markets: An AI Collaboration Framework Based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts	Artificial intelligence (AI) has been witnessed to provide valuable solutions to all walks of life. However, data island and computing resources limitations in the centralized AI architectures have increased their technical barriers, and thus distributed AI collaboration in data, models, and resources has attracted intensive research interests. Since the existing trust-based collaboration models are no longer applicable for the large-scale distributed collaboration among trustless machines in open and dynamic environments, this article proposes a novel decentralized AI collaboration framework, i.e., learning markets (LM), in which blockchain provides a trustless environment for collaboration and transaction, while smart contracts serve as software-defined agents to encapsulate and process scalable collaboration relationships and market mechanisms. LM can not only help those participants without mutual trust realize collaborative mining with dynamic and quantitative rewards but also build an AI market with natural auditability and traceability for trading trusted and verified models. We implement and comprehensively analyze LM based on the Ethereum interplenary file system platform (IPFS), and the results prove that it has advantages in collaboration fairness, transparency, security, decentralization and universality. Based on our collaboration framework, distributed AI contributors are expected to cooperate and complete those learning tasks that cannot be done previously due to lack of complete data, sufficient computing resources and state-of-the-art models.	collaboration;artificial intelligence;data models;computational modeling;smart contracts;blockchain;distributed databases;artificial intelligence (ai) collaboration;blockchain;ensemble learning;federated learning (fl);smart contractsinternet

547	协同技术	Chain-Based Covert Data Embedding Schemes in Blockchain	The quality of covert communications is determined by the choice of communication channels and the design of data embedding schemes. Recently, the Bitcoin system is prevalent as a covert communication channel. The consensus mechanism requires participants to spread their found valid blocks under an adjustable difficulty, which provides a stable periodic broadcast channel. Moreover, senders and receivers are difficult to be traced, because the Bitcoin system is pseudonymous. However, since the historical data in the ledger cannot be removed from the Bitcoin system, the openness and the persistent storage of the ledger in the Bitcoin system post new challenges when designing data embedding schemes. More concreteness, most traditional data embedding schemes either design by heuristic or empirical algorithms or use a fixed field to embed data in the transactions. Therefore, the covert data can be recognized once the algorithm is leaked or the pattern is explored. In this article, we first propose a hash chain-based covert data embedding (HC-CDE) scheme. The embedded transactions are difficult to be discovered. We further propose an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman chain-based covert data embedding (ECDHC-CDE) scheme to enhance the security of the HC-CDE scheme. Experimental analysis on the Bitcoin Testnet verifies the security and the efficiency of the proposed schemes.	bitcoin;receivers;security;blockchain;public key;internet of things;communication channels;bitcoin;blockchain;covert communication;flexible;information hiding
548	实体经济	Privacy-Preserving Adaptive Trajectory Storage on Blockchain for COVID-19 Contact Tracing	Privacy preservation in various contact tracing approaches for the COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 virus is challenging, as such applications tend to reveal users' points of interest (POIs) and other sensitive data shared together with their location information. This paper proposes COVID-19 eavesdropping resistant tracing (COVERT)-Blockchain, a novel distributed-ledger-based platform to facilitate contact tracing without invading users' privacy. COVERT-Blockchain enables infected users to share only their anonymized location traces on the Blockchain with a sliding window of the previous 15 days, thereby avoiding constant location information sharing with third party users. To further reduce the chances of revealing the corresponding users' trajectories, in COVERT-Blockchain we employ an adaptive logging mechanism to store trajectory data for contact tracing only if the users stayed in a location where there is significant presence of other humans around them for a relatively long duration of time. This ensures anonymity where the trajectory is generated differently each time for each user, and such infrequent and random trajectory generation enables us to generate unidentifiable trajectories for each user and thus preserve their privacy. COVERT-Blockchain is evaluated for scalability and robustness in relation to overhead and delays in storing and retrieving data from the Blockchain. Results show it to efficiently achieve contact tracing without any breaches of privacy.	data and data science;trajectory;planning and analysis;blockchain
549	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Data Storage With Privacy and Authentication in Internet of Things	Internet of Things (IoT) composed of large number of sensing devices with a variety of features applicable for various applications. In such scenarios, due to low data handling capabilities, limited storage, and security aspects, it is quite challenging to protect networks against illegal information access and utilizes storage efficiently. Though researchers provide various solutions for security and data storage, but a few solutions are appropriate for wireless sensor networks (WSNs)-enabled IoTs. Therefore, a blockchain-based decentralized framework integrated with authentication and privacy-preserving schemes is developed for the secure communication in WSNs-enabled IoTs. Registration, certification, and revocation process are employed for the communication with sensor nodes and base station (BS) in a cloud computing environment. In this scheme cluster heads forward the collected information to the BS. Consequently, BS records all the key parameters on the distributed blockchain and large data is forwarded to clouds for the storage. The revoked certificates of all malicious nodes are eliminated from blockchain by BS. The performance of the proposed scheme is scrutinized in terms of detection accuracy, certification delay, computational, and communicational overheads. The simulated results, comparative analysis, and security validation support the superiority of the proposed solution over the existing approaches.	wireless sensor networks;authentication;cloud computing;internet of things;privacy;blockchain;distributed;internet of things (iot);privacy and authentication;security;wireless sensor network (wsn)wireless sensor networks;key agreement scheme;efficient user authentication;iot;secure;algorithm;protocol
550	协同技术	Understanding Characteristics and System Implications of DAG-Based Blockchain in IoT Environments	Blockchain is starting to be deployed in the Internet of Things (IoT) to enable autonomous device-to-device transactions. However, traditional block-based blockchain techniques, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are not suitable for IoT environments due to their low throughput, high computation overhead, and costly transaction fee. To satisfy the requirements of IoT environments, directed-acyclic-graph (DAG)-based approaches, aiming to provide cheap blockchain services with low latency and high throughput, are emerging. This article presents a set of comprehensive experimental studies on IOTA, a representative DAG-based blockchain. We aim to exhibit its unique characteristics mainly from three aspects: 1) performance; 2) security; and 3) system robustness. We have developed a series of benchmark tools and judiciously selected typical configurations to perform experimental examinations with a real private IOTA network. Our studies reveal several interesting findings: 1) the throughput of IOTA is higher than the traditional block-based blockchain but far less than the reported thousands of transactions per second (TPS) in its whitepaper, even with scaling-up configurations; 2) the database query heavily impacts the performance of IOTA, even more than its mining [i.e., Proof of Work (PoW)] process; and 3) the system robustness of IOTA is closely related to the frequency of the incoming transactions while the milestone sent by the centralized coordinator has little effect on the system robustness. We make our benchmark tools public and expect our works can inspire system architects, application designers, and practitioners with new optimization directions and potential application cases for further exploration.	blockchains;throughput;internet of things;machine-to-machine communications;benchmark testing;tools;robustness;benchmark tool;internet-of-things (iot) blockchain;performance evaluationsecurity;internet;privacy
551	协同技术	A Blockchain-Assisted Massive IoT Data Collection Intelligent Framework	Due to the vigorous development of wireless communication technology, massive sensors have been gradually connected to the Internet of Things (IoT) and generate a massive quantity of valuable IoT data from large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs) controlled by different owners. Massive IoT data need to be collected and circulated among multiple data owners and data users. However, existing data collection frameworks may cause heavy computational overhead or rely on trusted third parties, since sensors have constrained resources. Consequently, massive IoT data are transformed among different parties, causing severe trust and security issues. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted massive IoT data collection (MIDC) intelligent framework to support the security, trust and efficiency of massive data collection for large-scale heterogeneous WSNs. In particular, we propose a series of novel technologies for the framework: 1) we design a large-scale heterogeneous WSNs collaborative identity verification protocol to ensure reliable data sources; 2) we build a hierarchical massive data aggregation scheme to collect massive IoT data efficiently and securely; and 3) we depict a blockchain-based massive IoT data management method to construct trust among different parties.

552	技术治理	Prevention method of block withholding attack based on miners' mining behavior in blockchain	This paper proposes a prevention method of block withholding attack (PMBWA) based on miners' mining behavior in blockchain to prevent the block withholding attack. The PMBWA first performs the data pre-processing based on the box chart detection algorithm for data cleaning and preliminary verification. Then the PMBWA uses the behavior reward, punishment mechanism, and credit model to comprehensively evaluate the contribution of miners. The PMBWA proposes a credit level classification algorithm (CLCA) of miners that weighs posterior probability and similarity to detect the malicious miners. Finally, the PMBWA allocates the corresponding income weight for miners of different credit levels. The simulation results show that regardless of how the numbers of blocks and malicious computing power change, the PMBWA can allocate low-income weight to the corresponding malicious computing power, and significantly improve the precision rate and recall rate of malicious computing power detection in the defensive mining pool. The PMBWA can largely reduce the average cumulative income of malicious computing power and improve the average cumulative income of non-malicious computing power. The PMBWA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods such as ICIAS, SRIAS, and IASCM.	blockchain;block withholding attack;proof of work;malicious miner detectionselection

Even if crises have the capacity to reveal the structural problems that underlie the various components of social systems, little systematic knowledge exists on how museums respond to these situations. Combining what is known about how museums reacted to previous crisis and empirical evidence of how museums recently adjusted their activities and strategies, the article highlights how art museums in Western Europe started to tackle the ambivalent challenge to pursue social purposes while being urged to monetize possible assets. During the COVID-19 pandemic, art museums have adopted 'emergency' and 'emerging' strategies associated with the modification of the funding mix, new partnerships and collaborations, and sustainable financing. The offer of digital services, a moderate reliance on crowdfunding, blockchain technologies, and an increased sensitivity of community needs, are among the novelties that art museums engaged with. Forerunners that had started with such practices before the pandemic, had the opportunity to take these to the next level.	art museums;financing strategies;funding mix;partnerships;risk management;covid-19;pandemic;crisisculture
554	实体经济	Edge Computing and Lightning Network Empowered Secure Food Supply Management	The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of food safety and supply chain governance. In other words, we need to ensure traceability along the supply chain and support high-frequency transactions, effective data collections, etc. Thus, we posit the potential of using a lightning network, which is a decentralized traceable paradigm for achieving high-frequency transactions in blockchain-based systems. In addition, we also utilize edge computing to help facilitate data collection. However, a key challenge in securing food supplies is determining the optimal global transaction path in the lightning network while achieving efficiency and meeting the dynamic nature of food supply management. Thus, we propose a blockchain-edge scheme that utilizes our proposed dynamic programming to produce optimal solutions for selecting global transaction paths. Specifically, our scheme optimizes routing fees under existing constraints (e.g., transmission cost, computing resource consumption, and lightning network balance). The findings from our evaluations demonstrate the utility of our proposed approach in facilitating food safety management.	lightning;sensors;supply chains;optimization;internet of things;real-time systems;blockchain;dynamic programming;edge computing;food supply management;lightning network;optimizationblockchain

The mining pool is abstracted as a queueing system, and the batch service M/M/c queueing model with feedback, vacation, and repairable faults is used to model and analyze this queueing system, the method of matrix-geometric solution is used to solve the stationary distribution of the system. In order to reduce the energy consumption of mining pools and suppress block generation time, this paper introduces a vacation strategy and a feedback mechanism, and verifies the effectiveness of the two strategies through experimental comparison. In addition, this paper studies the optimal revenue of the mining pool based on factors such as transaction fees, block rewards and energy costs, and obtains the computing power and number of miners that maximize the revenue of the mining pool.	blockchain;mining pool;proof of work;queueing modelqueue;equilibrium;balking

To qualitatively assess this gap, we conducted a literature review by investigating a final number of 169 original contributions produced in the last half-decade.

However, since centralized MCS confronts severe security and privacy risks in reality, many researchers are devoted to building a decentralized MCS system based on blockchain. Despite the effectiveness of these schemes, they fail to offer anonymous authentication on the trust of MCS nodes, although privacy is a main concern in MCS and trust plays an important role in a series of MCS activities, such as worker selection and truth discovery. Nevertheless, anonymous authentication on trust is not a trivial issue since trust evaluation usually conflicts with anonymity, which is a necessary privacy requirement in an open MCS environment. To tackle this problem, we leverage Intel software guard extension (SGX) and propose a scheme to anonymously authenticate trust with trustworthy trust evaluation in a blockchain-based MCS system. The scheme employs an SGX-enabled cloud server to periodically alter user public/private key pairs and mix newly altered keys among a number of faked keys in order to ensure unlinkability. Besides, we consider the unique features of MCS and work out a novel trust evaluation method by aggregating both subjective feedback and objective behaviors. Finally, we conduct several analyses and experiments to illustrate its security and efficiency.	privacy;authentication;blockchain;smart contracts;internet of things;crowdsourcing;anonymous authentication;blockchain;mobile crowdsourcing (mcs);trustpractical reputation system
558	市场治理	CT-GCN: a phishing identification model for blockchain cryptocurrency transactions	With the widespread application of blockchain technology, the cyberspace security issue of phishing has also appeared in the emerging blockchain cryptocurrency ecosystem. Because phishing fraud in cryptocurrency transactions has its own unique characteristics compared to traditional phishing, many existing phishing detection algorithms are not usable. Therefore, based on graph convolutional networks, we have researched and built a high-performance model for detecting blockchain cryptocurrency phishing fraud. Our model divides the constructed blockchain cryptocurrency transaction graph into "Sender" and "Receiver" graphs, according to the sending and receiving directions. Then, the edge features in the graph are transferred. Finally, we use a double-layer graph convolution network for feature learning and send it to the classifier for fraud detection. After completing training on the actual dataset collected from Ethereum, the model achieved an accuracy of 88.02% and an F1 score of 88.14% on the test data, which had a better performance than that of the other models. Our model provides a new concept for the detection of phishing scams in blockchain cryptocurrency networks.	blockchain;ethereum;phishing detection;graph embedding;transaction networks
559	实体经济	Blockchain Technology Adoption: Multinational Analysis of the Agriculture Supply Chain	Agri-produce holds an inimitable place in human-life across the globe. It is an inevitable requirement of livelihoods across the globe. Advanced technologies to improve multiple aspects of agriculture have been developed in recent years. The blockchain technology (BCT) is among these technologies that is proving to be pivotal in supporting business transactions in today's digitally connected environment. This article explores BCT adoption in the agriculture supply chain while focusing on comparing the trends in developed versus developing economies. The study was geared toward identifying the enabling factors and barriers to BCT adoption in the agriculture supply chain. Data was collected from The Netherlands, United States, Saudi Arabia, and India. The study used the Interpretive Structural Modeling-Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory in identifying the factors and ranking them based on their extent of influence. While the study found differences of the enabling factors among the four economies, it also identified that policies are the most important enabler of BCT adoption in the agriculture supply chain.	blockchains;supply chains;agriculture;stakeholders;technological innovation;smart agriculture;safety;agriculture supply chain;agriculture;blockchain;dematel;ismchallenges;traceability;management;safety;issues;retail;waste
560	实体经济	Deep learning technology of Internet of Things Blockchain in distribution network faults	Nowadays, the development of human society and daily life are inseparable from the power supply. Therefore, people also put forward higher requirements for the reliability of distribution network, but power companies can only passively deal with distribution network failures, which is a bottleneck for the improvement of distribution network reliability. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the best solution for online equipment status monitoring and basic data sharing for large, widely distributed, relatively fixed, and large numbers of equipment. The construction of the IoT for power distribution equipment faces many important problems, including the selection of networking, equipment selection, and interaction standards. When researching the implementation plan, research on the distribution of IoT market was carried out. Based on the grid, the idea of optimizing the investment selection plan of the power distribution using IoT was discussed, and a result verification model was established. After the completion of the theoretical part, a case study of medium-voltage distribution grid equipment management and medium-voltage distribution network equipment management based on the grid was carried out by taking a real enterprise application situation as an example. Realizing fault diagnosis of distribution network will not only provide decision support for operation and maintenance of distribution network for power companies, but also have great economic and social benefits. Aiming at the shortcomings of single data mining method in distribution network fault diagnosis, hybrid data mining method is proposed. First, rough set theory is used to reduce the original fault data and form a simplified rule set. Because of the non-linearity of distribution network fault and the strong learning ability, adaptability, and robustness of Bayesian network, Bayesian network can be used to classify distribution network faults. Therefore, a simplified fault diagnosis system is established in this paper, and its correctness is confirmed. Then, the learning and training are carried out by using Bayesian network to call the simplest rule set, which has the characteristics of short learning and training time and high diagnostic accuracy.	distribution network fault diagnosis;data mining;information entropy;bayesian network
561	实体经济	Blockchain Enables Your Bill Safer	As one of the most frequently used Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, energy smart meter has been widely adopted to facilitate the measures of residential energy use. Residents pay for the bills from energy suppliers according to their monthly/seasonal usage. Practically, there is a demand from residents/governments to check whether the bills are in line with their real consumptions. However, it is challenging to realize this demand due to two critical problems. The first problem refers to the nonrepudiated privacy issue caused by access to residents' energy consumption history (e.g., data integrity may be questioned, and residents' daily timetables may be exposed). The second problem comes from the efficiency requirement for bulk auditing requests on residents' bills and consumptions, usually risen by governments. So far, we have not found any solutions that can be directly used in this case. In this article, we propose using homomorphic encryption cooperated with the blockchain technique to leverage the data auditing and privacy-preserving requirements. We also employe a certificateless signature to resolve the efficiency bottleneck in batch auditing. This framework, called pAuditChain, not only accepts personal requests from residents for consumption checking but also handles bulk auditing requests issued by governments. To validate the correctness of the framework functions, we carried out a series of theoretical analysis, especially on the privacy preserving and auditing processes. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is among the first solutions to improve the security and privacy of bills without losing the auditing function. Our approach concerns with IoT smart meters in energy supply industries and could be further extended to other forms of IoT devices with the bill demands.	government;smart meters;data privacy;encryption;auditing;blockchain;internet of things (iot) (meter);privacy
562	实体经济	HARB: A Hypergraph-Based Adaptive Consortium Blockchain for Decentralized Energy Trading	The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and distributed energy resources (DERs), has given rise to collaborative communities that manage their energy production and consumption load through peer-to-peer decentralized energy trading (P2P DET). To address the issue of distributed trust in these communities, blockchain technology is widely considered as a promising solution due to its ability to provide records provenance and visibility. However, the current blockchain-based platforms are known to compromise on scalability and privacy in favor of trustless interactions and often do not support interoperability. In this work, we propose a hypergraph-based adaptive consortium blockchain (HARB) framework, which coordinates DERs through high-order relationships rather than P2P pairwise relationships. HARB is presented in a three-layered network architecture to address the aforementioned challenges. The bottom layer (Underlay) addresses the issue of scalability, by exploiting the rich representation ability of hypergraphs to describe complex relationships among DERs and end users. We use the described complex relations to form scalable network clusters with intra- and inter-community energy trading relationships. The middle layer (Overlay) presents a blockchain service model to describe adaptive blockchain modules that support interoperability between the network clusters. To preserve privacy, we present a data tagging and anonymization model in the top layer (Contract), which attributes transactions to specific network clusters. To evaluate our framework, we modeled various IoT devices with different computing resource profiles to simulate a distributed energy trading (DET) environment. The analyzed results have shown that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of blockchain-based DET systems.	scalability;interoperability;internet of things;privacy;computer architecture;computational modeling;blockchain;clustering;distributed energy trading (det);hypergraphs;internet of things (iot);notaries
563	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based Dual-Side Privacy-Preserving Multiparty Computation Scheme for Edge-Enabled Smart Grid	Unlike a traditional centralized and producer-controlled power grid, the smart grid is a more complicated distributed power system consisted of many resources and applications. In smart grid, huge amounts of data generated by edge devices are collected by different parties. To achieve high operation efficiency, it is important to enable the data sharing and cooperative computation among different parties. How to protect the security and privacy of the utility data and the identities of their owners has become a major concern. There have been some studies on this issue. However, most of these works failed to consider the privacy protection in the dual sides of the data owner and receiver. In this article, we propose BPM4SG, a blockchain-based dual-side privacy-preserving multiparty computation (MPC) scheme for edge-enabled smart grid. In BPM4SG, the data segmentation method is adopted to ensure the security of MPC (e.g., summation) in edge nodes. The consortium blockchain and smart contract are used to further increase the system security and avoid the dependency on trusted third parties. Additionally, a data obfuscation method based on the ring signatures and a new one-time address scheme are proposed to protect the privacy of both the data owner and data receiver. The analysis shows that BPM4SG can meet the security and privacy requirements of smart grid. The experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme has a better performance compared with other popular schemes.	blockchain;data analytics;edge computing;privacy preservation;secure multiparty computation;smart gridresearch issues;internet;aggregation;iot
564	实体经济	An appraisal of blockchain technology relevance in the 21st century Nigerian construction industry: perspective from the built environment professionals	Purpose Studies show that the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies can be used to transform the built environment sector in the 21st century. Blockchain technology has been identified as one of the drivers of 4IR that could be a channel of innovation in the built environment. Studies concerning the application of blockchain technology in Nigeria's built environment are scarce. Thus, this study aims to investigate the relevance of blockchain technology to the Nigerian built environment professionals (BEP) in the 21st century and proffer ways to promote the applications in the sector. Design/methodology/approach Given the unexplored nature of the issue in Nigeria's context, 20 semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted across Lagos and Abuja cities. The participants were knowledgeable in construction-related information technology, from construction contracting firms and construction consulting firms, academicians in construction consultancy and internet and communication technology experts. The collated data were coded, analysed and presented in themes via a thematic approach. Findings Automating construction progress payments in smart contracts, financial management and supply chain management reduces transaction costs emerged as the key areas where blockchain technology can benefit the Nigerian BEP if well implemented. Others are blockchain-based BIM and prevents forgery and alteration of data, contract management and blockchain-based building information modelling (BIM). Blockchain technology applications are not without some hindrances. The 22 perceived hindrances were government, employer and employee related in Nigeria's built environment. Research limitations/implications This research is restricted to the relevance and encumbrances facing the applications of blockchain technology in Nigeria's built environment. Also, this study proffers policy solutions to promote the application of blockchain technology in the built environment via a qualitative method. Future study becomes pertinent to explore other components of the 4IR and their relevance within Nigeria's built environment. Practical implications Results from this paper will strengthen and offer a rich insight into the relevance of blockchain technology in the Nigerian built environment. Other developing nations with similar challenges may consider the recommendations from this study. This study will contribute towards stirring the parties to create a good platform and supporting policies to promote the applications and implementation of blockchain technology across the industry. Originality/value This paper is one of the few papers that attempted to uncover issues that hinder blockchain technology applications in the Nigerian built environment via a qualitative approach and proffer feasible solutions from the practitioners' perspective.	blockchain;built environment professionals (bep);construction industry;fourth industrial revolution technologies;nigeriasocial innovation;revolution;government;elements
565	核心技术	A secure cross-chain transaction model based on quantum multi-signature	There is an obvious demand for blockchain to break the "data island" by crossing chains. Notary signature is one of the common cross-chain methods, and its security depends on the security of the signature algorithm. However, with the development of quantum computing, classical authentication of blockchain based on mathematical cryptography algorithms is not secure enough to prevent quantum attacks. Designing a signature algorithm to ensure the security of blockchain transactions in the post-quantum era is a problem to be solved at present. In the existing quantum signature algorithms, there are some problems, such as the arbitrators are not completely trusted, the quantum measurement loss is not traceable, and the transaction efficiency is low. Hence, our main work is as follows: (i) A cross-chain transaction model is proposed, which includes a quantum multi-signature notary mechanism and an assets quantum-freeze algorithm. (ii) The quantum multi-signature scheme can not only prevent forgery and denial, but also trace back malicious notaries. Moreover, it has the advantages of low storage overhead, decentralization, and high efficiency. (iii) Quantum freeze scheme can prevent messages from being tampered with when the system allocates transferred data or assets to the connector after transaction verification. It effectively improves system transaction security and ensures privacy.	blockchain cross-chain certification;quantum multi-signature;cross-chain transaction;quantum-freezediscrete logarithms;algorithms
566	实体经济	Modelling perceived risk in blockchain enabled supply chain utilizing fuzzy-AHP	Purpose Blockchain has been considered a disrupting technology that can add value in various supply chains differently. The provenance framework matches the four blockchain capabilities of traceability, certifiability, trackability and verifiability to the five generic risks, namely, the financial risk, psychological risk, social risk, physical risk and performance risk. This will help in uncording which specific risk gets mitigated by the use of blockchain in a specific supply chain. Design/methodology/approach This study illustrates four supply chains, namely, pharmaceutical industry, fast moving consumer goods industry, precious metal and automotive industry, and maps the risks associated with them to the provenance framework wherein the applicability of blockchain is mapped. Fuzzy analytical hierarchical processing (F-AHP) is used to rank the risks in the supply chain. Findings Blockchain capabilities can elevate the provenance knowledge leading to assurance in terms of origin, authenticity, custody and integrity to mitigate the supply chain risks. Present work highlights the thrust areas across various supply chains and identifies the risk priority tasks aligning the contextual supply chain risks. This study has covered five major risk perceptions. This study contributes to the literature on blockchain, customer perceived risk, provenance and supply chain. Practical implications This methodology can be adopted to understand and market the application of blockchain in a supply chain. It brings the marketers and marketing perspective to the supply chain. Exhaustive risk perception can be included to get more comprehensive data on mapping the risks along different supply chains. Vertical extensions of this work can be consideration of other supply chains including dairy, fruits and vegetables, electronics and component assemblies to derive the comprehensive framework for mapping risk perceptions and thereby supply chain risk mitigation through blockchain technology. Originality/value This linkage between blockchain, perceived risk, applications in the supply chain and a tool to convince the customers about the blockchain applicability has not been discussed in the literature. Adopting the multi-criteria decision-making F-AHP approach, this study attempt to rank the risks and stimulate conversations around a common framework for multiple sectors.	blockchain;perceived risks;fuzzy analytical hierarchical processing (f-ahp);supply chain;risk mitigationchallenges;logistics;design;trust
567	核心技术	Data governance through a multi-DLT architecture in view of the GDPR	The centralization of control over the processing of personal data threatens the privacy of individuals due to the lack of transparency and the obstruction of easy access to their data. Individuals need the tools to effectively exercise their rights, enshrined in regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Having direct control over the flow of their personal data would not only favor their privacy but also a "data altruism", as supported by the new European proposal for a Data Governance Act. In this work, we propose a multi-layered architecture for the management of personal information based on the use of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). After an in-depth analysis of the tensions between the GDPR and DLTs, we propose the following components: (1) a personal data storage based on a (possibly decentralized) file storage (DFS) to guarantee data sovereignty to individuals, confidentiality and data portability; (2) a DLT-based authorization system to control access to data through two distributed mechanisms, i.e. secret sharing (SS) and threshold proxy re-encryption (TPRE); (3) an audit system based on a second DLT. Furthermore, we provide a prototype implementation built upon an Ethereum private blockchain, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Sia and we evaluate its performance in terms of response time.	distributed ledger technology;gdpr;smart contracts;personal data;decentralized file storage;data governanceblockchain;management
568	核心技术	TICK: Tiny Client for Blockchains	In order to be deployed on storage-limited devices, blockchains generally provide lightweight clients which only store all the block headers rather than all blocks. However, a lightweight client is hard to verify a newly issued transaction, thus making the zero-confirmation transactions between lightweight clients impossible. In particular, transaction verification needs to verify that each referred output of the transaction is not previously spent. The conventional lightweight client design is unscalable as it can only support such an operation in the complexity of O(NT), where NT is the total number of transactions in the system. The latest proposals suggest summarizing all the unspent outputs in an ordered Merkle tree. Therefore, a light client can request proof of presence and/or absence of an element in it to prove whether a referred output is previously spent or not, in the complexity of O(log(NU)), where NU is the total number of unspent output in the system. However, updating such ordered Merkle tree is slow, thus making the system impractical-by our evaluation, when a new block is generated in Bitcoin, it takes more than one minute to update the ordered Merkle tree. We propose a practical client, TICK, to solve this problem. TICK uses the AVL hash tree to store all the unspent outputs. The AVL hash tree can be updated in the time of O(M*log(NU)), where M is the number of elements that need to be inserted or removed from the AVL hash tree. By evaluation, when a new block is generated, the AVL hash tree can be updated within 1 s. Similarly, the proof can also be generated in the time of O(log(NU)). Therefore, TICK is practical and scalable. Benefited by the AVL hash tree, a storage-limited device can efficiently and cryptographically verify transactions. In addition, rather than requiring new miners to download the entire blockchain before mining, TICK allows new miners to download only a small portion of data to start mining. We implement TICK for Bitcoin and provide an experimental evaluation on its performance by using the current Bitcoin blockchain data. Our result shows that the proof for verifying whether an output of a transaction is spent or not is only several kB. The verification is very fast-generating a proof generally takes less than 1 ms and verifying a proof even takes much less time. In addition, to start mining, new miners only need to download several GB data, rather than downloading over 230-GB data.	blockchain;light client;transaction verification
569	协同技术	CREAT: Blockchain-Assisted Compression Algorithm of Federated Learning for Content Caching in Edge Computing	Edge computing architectures can help us quickly process the data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) and caching files to edge nodes can speed up the response speed of IoT devices requesting files. Blockchain architectures can help us ensure the security of data transmitted by IoT. Therefore, we have proposed a system that combines IoT devices, edge nodes, remote cloud, and blockchain. In the system, we designed a new algorithm in which blockchain-assisted compressed algorithm of federated learning is applied for content caching, called CREAT to predict cached files. In the CREAT algorithm, each edge node uses local data to train a model and then uses the model to learn the features of users and files, so as to predict popular files to improve the cache hit rate. In order to ensure the security of edge nodes' data, we use federated learning (FL) to enable multiple edge nodes to cooperate in training without sharing data. In addition, for the purpose of reducing communication load in FL, we will compress gradients uploaded by edge nodes to reduce the time required for communication. What is more, in order to ensure the security of the data transmitted in the CREAT algorithm, we have incorporated blockchain technology in the algorithm. We design four smart contracts for decentralized entities to record and verify the transactions to ensure the security of data. We used MovieLens data sets for experiments and we can see that CREAT greatly improves the cache hit rate and reduces the time required to upload data.	edge computing;internet of things;data models;cloud computing;load modeling;task analysis;blockchain;edge computing;federated learning (fl);gradients compressioninternet;5g
570	协同技术	A Reliable Data-Transmission Mechanism Using Blockchain in Edge Computing Scenarios	With the advent of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, more and more devices are connected to the IoT. Under the traditional cloud-thing centralized management mode, the transmission of massive data is facing many difficulties, and the reliability of data is difficult to be guaranteed. As emerging technologies, blockchain technology and edge computing (EC) technology have attracted the attention of academia in improving the reliability, privacy, and invariability of IoT technology. In this article, we combine the characteristics of the EC and blockchain to ensure the reliability of data transmission in the IoT. First, we propose a data transmission mechanism based on blockchain, which uses the distributed architecture of blockchain to ensure that the data is not tampered with; second, we introduce the three-tier structure in the architecture in turn; and finally, we introduce the four working steps of the mechanism, which are similar to the working mechanism of blockchain. In the end, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can ensure the reliability of data transmission in the IoT to a great extent.	internet of things;data communication;cloud computing;reliability;sensors;blockchain;data-transmission mechanism;edge computing (ec);internet of things (iot)software defined networking;as-a-service;iot
571	协同技术	A Secure Data Aggregation Strategy in Edge Computing and Blockchain-Empowered Internet of Things	With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), more and more data are generated by smart devices to support various edge services. Since these data may contain sensitive information, security and privacy of data aggregation has become a key challenge in IoT. To tackle this problem, a blockchain-based secure data aggregation strategy, namely (BSDA), is proposed for edge computing empowered IoT. Specifically, in order to restrict task receivers [i.e., mobile data collectors (MDCs)] to search and accept tasks, the block header is intergraded with a security label including task security level (SL) and task completion requirement. Accordingly, new block generation rules are developed to improve system performance in throughput and transaction latency. Furthermore, BSDA decomposes both sensitive tasks and task receivers into groups against privacy disclosure. On the other hand, a deep reinforcement learning method, the improved self-adaptive double bootstrapped deep deterministic policy gradient (IDDPG), is developed to design energy-efficient MDC routes under the constrains that the SLs of MDCs should be higher than the SLs of data aggregation tasks. Simulation results indicate that 1) as a privacy-preserving strategy, BSDA obtains high throughput and low transaction latency and 2) BSDA outperforms certain contemporary strategies in aggregation ratio and energy cost.	task analysis;data aggregation;receivers;edge computing;internet of things;blockchain;data aggregation;deep reinforcement learning (drl);edge computing;internet of things (iot)connectivity restoration;restoring connectivity;iot;architecture;simulation
572	协同技术	Intelligent Resource Allocation for Video Analytics in Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Autonomous Vehicles With Edge Computing	Video surveillance in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) is in the rapid growth stage, where video analytics is a potential technology to improve the safety of the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV). However, massive video data transmission and computation-intensive video analytics bring an overwhelming burden for vehicular networks. Moreover, owing to the unstable network connection, the video data are not always reliable, which makes data sharing a lack of security and scalability in IoAV. In this work, we first propose a video analytics framework, where the multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and blockchain technologies are integrated into IoAV to optimize the transaction throughput of the blockchain system as well as reducing the latency of the MEC system. Furthermore, based on deep reinforcement learning, the joint optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), and the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm is adopted to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach can fast converge and significantly improve the performance of blockchain-enabled IoAV with MEC.	streaming media;edge computing;peer-to-peer computing;optimization;resource management;throughput;blockchain;deep reinforcement learning (drl);internet of autonomous vehicles (ioav);multiaccess edge computing (mec);video analyticsobject detection;communication;networks;architecture
573	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Incentive Energy-Knowledge Trading in IoT: Joint Power Transfer and AI Design	Recently, edge artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., federated edge learning) are emerged to unleash the potential of big data from Internet of Things (IoT). By learning knowledge on local devices, data privacy preserving and Quality of Service (QoS) are guaranteed. Nevertheless, the dilemma between the limited on-device battery capacities and the high energy demands in learning is not resolved. When the on-device battery is exhausted, the edge learning process will have to be interrupted. In this article, we propose a novel wirelessly powered edge intelligence (WPEG) framework, which aims to achieve a stable, robust, and sustainable edge intelligence by energy harvesting (EH) methods. First, we build a permissioned edge blockchain to secure the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy and knowledge sharing in our framework. To maximize edge intelligence efficiency, we then investigate the wirelessly powered multiagent edge learning model and design the optimal edge learning strategy. Moreover, by constructing a two-stage Stackelberg game, the underlying energy-knowledge trading incentive mechanisms are also proposed with the optimal economic incentives and power transmission strategies. Finally, simulation results show that our incentive strategies could optimize the utilities of both parties compared with classic schemes, and our optimal learning design could realize the optimal learning efficiency.	batteries;artificial intelligence;smart devices;internet of things;wireless power transfer;performance evaluation;edge intelligence;game theory;incentive mechanism;permissioned blockchain;wireless power transfer (wpt)wireless information;intelligence;allocation
574	虚拟经济	Making uncertainty operable: social coordination through game theory in decentralized finance	As blockchain technologies are discussed in their political dimensions, this paper questions the political implications of developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). It looks at the ways that DeFi projects refer to game theory as a template for designing the integration of off-chain financial processes into on-chain processes. DeFi's reference to game theory carries normative understandings of social coordination that oscillate between (liberal) cooperation and (neo-liberal) non-cooperation and defection. This is evidenced in the ways that DeFi installs fundamental uncertainty as well as the reliability of participants' information, as the key resource for modeling social coordination. While referring to a libertarian notion of 'collective intelligence,' the models tend to involve participants in high-stake transactions under conditions of uncertainty. These results have consequences for the social studies of finance more generally: The prominence of game theory in DeFi indicates that the performativity of economic theory, often depicted in the ways that theory-derived models enable pricing calculation and the transformation of uncertainty into risk, may also result in the celebration of radical uncertainty as a resource of strategic action.	blockchain;decentralized finance;game theory;liberalism;security;social coordinationgovernance;markets
575	核心技术	A model-based smart contracts system via blockchain technology to reduce delays and conflicts in construction management processes	Purpose Smart contracts using blockchain technology (BCT) is a tool that decentralizes authority and makes it easier to upgrade the contract administration process by providing an efficient system. Current literature provides a good overview of contracts in the construction industry; however, the specific details of BCT's smart contracts applications in the three categories have not been addressed adequately: (1) information quality, (2) enhancing project schedule and progress payment time and (3) reducing conflicts among project stakeholders. Thus, this study aims to analyze smart contracts using BCT by creating a computerized contract model, specifically evaluating its impact on the three identified categories. Design/methodology/approach In this paper BCT-SmContract was developed through an automated program that utilizes blockchain to define the contractual agreements between different parties in a construction project. BCT-SmContract model provides a new technique to overcome the current challenges associated with factors identified in this study, i.e. (1) information quality, (2) enhancing project schedule and progress payment time and (3) reducing conflicts among project stakeholders. Afterward, the model was tested to ensure validity and reliability through a construction project. Findings The findings indicated that BCT-SmContract was approximately 90% faster to execute the contract and 100% accurate in reflecting the correct information about the project status, resulting in reduced conflicts. Originality/value This study has contributed in upgrading the traditional contracting method in construction by developing an automated smart contract model to enhance the processes and achieve higher accuracy.	blockchain technology (bct);smart contracts;contracts model;construction management processes;case study;categories
576	协同技术	A rendezvous block-based authentication framework for service-level security in decentralized cloud resources	Cloud services are distributed from manifold sources with autonomous security procedures. The conventional authentication methods result in asynchronous security towards multi-resource access and sharing. This provides volatile authentication for sequential service sessions. For alleviating this issue, a Rendezvous Block-based Authentication Framework (RBAF) is proposed. This framework is backboned with a blockchain paradigm that differentiates authentication based on rendezvous and asynchronous attributes. The modifications in initial and final attributes are observed, intended for training, and supplanted with service-dependent authentications. In the different sessions, attribute-based authentication and agreed end-to-end security are administered using agreed keys that are valid within the sessions. This key generation is modified using the new session and user attributes based on learning recommendations. The ledger paradigm records the session and its associated attributes for different training instances, based on which service flexibility is ensured. The proposed framework's performance is verified using the metrics service distribution ratio, false rate, session uptime, and service delay.	attribute authentication;blockchain;cloud service;machine learning;mutual key
577	协同技术	Block chain enabled auditing with optimal multi-key homomorphic encryption technique for public cloud computing environment	Cloud storage is a significant cloud computing (CC) service which enables the client to save and retrieve the data at anytime and anywhere. Due to the increased demand and familiarity of the CC environment, different kinds of security threats and susceptibilities are raised. Data integrity and privacy are the major problems in CC environment where the data can be saved in distinct geographic regions. So, privacy preservation and data integrity become important factors of the user concern related to the CC environment. Several auditing protocols are majorly dependent upon the conventional public key infrastructure, which led to high computational complexity and it is unsuitable for the setting of multiple users. To resolve these issues, this study develops a new block chain enabled auditing with optimal multi-key homomorphic encryption (BEA-OMKHE) technique for public cloud environment. The proposed BEA-OMKHE technique aims to assure data integrity, security, and auditing in public cloud storage. Besides, an OMKHE technique is derived to accomplish data integrating into the cloud environment by the design of end to end encryption system. A secure generation of keys and encryption processes are carried out by the use of MKHE technique; thereby the data becomes highly secure. In addition, the choice of keys is performed by the improved beetle antenna search optimization (IBAS) algorithm. Therefore, the proposed BEA-OMKHE technique offers an efficient way of enhancing the data integrity in CC method. The performance validation of the BEA-OMKHE technique takes place and the results are inspected under various aspects. The comparative result analysis ensured the betterment of the BEA-OMKHE technique interms of different measures such as communication cost, encryption time, decryption time, computation cost, privacy preserving rate, and authentication accuracy.	auditing;blockchain;cloud computing;encryption process;optimal key generation;securitysearchable encryption;integrity;framework;storage

It has grown from a conceptual level to having real applications in virtual reality games. The applicability of the Metaverse in numerous sectors like marketing, education, social, and even advertising exists. However, there exists little or no work on Metaverse applicability to the transportation industry. Data-driven intelligent transportation systems (DDITS) aim to provide more intelligent systems based on exploiting data. This paper reviews the concepts and features of the Metaverse. Also, the review goes over three dominant DDITS challenges: vehicle fault detection and repair, testing new technologies, and anti-theft systems. In addition, it highlights prospective Metaverse solutions that apply to the DDITS. Buttressing the utility of Metaverse in DDITS, this paper presents two major case studies: the invisible to visible (I2V) and the Metaverse on Wheels (MoW) technologies. Finally, the influence, limitations, and open issues of Metaverse applications to DDITS are discussed.	fault-detection;vehicles;reality;technology;model

Unfortunately, current personal data privacy protection schemes still suffer from explicit storage, lack of data ownership and implementation of fine-grained access control by users, and lack of transparency and auditability of data. In this article, we propose a personal data privacy protection scheme based on consortium blockchain that stores original data encrypted with an improved Paillier homomorphic encryption mechanism, namely PDPChain, where users realize fine-grained access control based on ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) on blockchain. In this scheme, consortium blockchain combines distributed private clusters to store the encrypted data, improving data transmission efficiency, and guaranteeing user privacy and security through off-chain storage and on-chain transmission synergy. In addition, it is more lightweight encryption and demarcation, ultimately protecting personal data privacy and providing a secure and trusted way to obtain information for data mining. For the performance testing, data in the form of files are used as an example, and the scheme is designed and simulated on Hyperledger Fabric and InterPlanetary File System. Experimental results show that the improved Paillier encryption mechanism reduces the overall encryption and decryption elapsed time by 25% and encryption elapsed time by 48%. Furthermore, the proposed CP-ABE access control method is adaptive to storing and sharing a massive amount of data. With the increase in the number of access control policies, the overall time-consuming of the scheme does not increase, and the time-consuming of decryption can also be stabilized at about 2 s.	blockchains;access control;data privacy;cryptography;homomorphic encryption;authentication;cloud computing;consortium blockchain;ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (cp-abe);homomorphic encryption;interplanetary file system (ipfs);privacy protection;secure sharing
581	实体经济	Patient-Centric Token-Based Healthcare Blockchain Implementation Using Secure Internet of Medical Things	Security and privacy are becoming increasingly difficult to preserve in today's fast-growing data world. We use the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to make quick diagnoses and get results. IoMT devices measure the human body's functioning in various parameters and collect, process, and store data in cloud servers. There is a public channel used to collect data from humans and send it to the cloud, which is highly unreliable and vulnerable to attacks. Another risk is storing data in a single centralized system, which can be vulnerable to a single-point failure. Blockchain is being used for secure data storage in a decentralized manner to avoid single-point failure. We propose a secure IoMT-based data collection method for patients and storing the data on the blockchain in accordance with general data protection regulation (GDPR). In the proposed system, IoMT devices send data to the cloud via the patient's personal digital assistant (PDA), and the cloud server transacts data on the blockchain. We propose a miner selection algorithm to avoid bias in the blockchain. We simulate various attacks on open channels between IoMT devices and the cloud servers. This scheme is implemented on a custom Python-based blockchain. IoT simulation is performed using the Bevywise IoT simulator and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) simulator. The security protocol is analyzed using Scyther.	blockchains;cloud computing;medical services;security;servers;data models;cryptography;authentication;blockchain;healthcare;internet of medical things (iomt);privacy;securityiot;authentication;protocol;scheme
582	实体经济	Towards roadmap to implement blockchain in healthcare systems based on a maturity model	Healthcare systems face various issues related to complex networks of intermediaries and a lack of transaction traceability. The most critical issues are the fragmentation of healthcare data, obstacles in providing efficient research and services, lack of clinical trial reporting, high cost and mismanagement of the drug supply chain, patient data security, and fake drugs. Blockchain technology has the potential to address these criticalities as it has in build traceability mechanisms and promises new business models by enabling incentive structures. This potential of blockchain gathers a high interest in the health industry. However, the implementation of blockchain in healthcare faces various issues as well. Currently, there are no practice-oriented maturity models to improve such an implementation. In this paper, we present a roadmap to develop a maturity model for blockchain in healthcare (MMBH) based on critical barriers (CBs), critical success factors (CSFs), and the best practices for blockchain implementation in healthcare systems. As a first step to develop the MMBH, in this paper, we present the initial results of a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify critical success factors for implementing blockchain in healthcare systems. We also applied fuzzy technique order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to prioritize the identified CSFs.	blockchain technology;critical barriers and success factors;drug supply chain;systematic and multivocal literature reviews;traceabilitydecision-making;fuzzy topsis;challenges;technology;readiness
583	协同技术	A novel blockchain federated safety-as-a-service scheme for industrial IoT using machine learning	Blockchains are costly in terms of computing and involve high overhead bandwidth and delays that are not suitable for smart appliances. Enhancing the precision of output, quality, and delivery of data is particularly critical in Machine Learning. The combination of Machine Learning and Blockchain technologies may create accurate results. The Industrial IoT (IIoT), has quickly been established and is getting huge attention in educational areas and manufacturing, but IoT solitude danger and privacy exposures are developing by lack of important security technology. Because blockchain technique's regionalization and information revelation were planned as a decentralized and distributed method to give assurance security and motivate the development of the IoT and IIoT. The Blockchain Driven Cyber-Physical system (BDCPS) is supported by IoT and cloud services. BDCPS will confirm the statement utilizing the Intelligent Agreements functionality and the trust-less peer-to-peer centrally controlled database showcase by a tiny-scale real-life Blockchain to the IoT system. In this study, a private Blockchain can be run on a separate board system and paralleled to a microcontroller with Smart devices. The suggested system uses blockchain technology to resolve issues such as lightweight, evaporation, warehousing transactions, and shipment time. The data flow of Blockchain is intended to demonstrate the application of machine learning to food traceability. Finally, to extend shelf life, a supply chain employs dependable and accurate data. This paper shows a relevant blockchain and machine learning research that identifies numerous key elements of combining the two technologies such as Blockchain and Machine Learning, including an overview, benefits, and applications.	blockchain;iot;security of information;machine learning;blockchain technology;cloud storage;industry 4;0research issues;technology;internet;optimization;networks;things
584	协同技术	Blockchain-based secure data transmission for internet of underwater things	Internet of Things (IoTs) is an integrated network collection of heterogeneous objects which enable seamless integration between systems, humans, devices, and various other things, to support pervasive computing for smart systems. IoT-driven systems and sensors continuously ingest data resulting in an increased volume and velocity of information which can lead to critical concerns such as security of the data and scalability of the system. The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) is a specific genre of IoTs in which data related to oceanic ecosystems is continuously sensed through underwater sensors. IoUT has emerged as an innovative paradigm to support smart oceans. However, there are several critical challenges which IoUT system designers must consider such as (1) scalability of the system to handle large volumes of oceanic data and (2) security of data that is transmitted from IoT sensors deployed underwater. Blockchain as a newly emerged technology and an enabling platform allows decentralized and secure transmission of data among a wide group of untrustworthy parties. This research aims to exploit blockchain technology to secure IoUT data transmission by exploiting Interplanetary File System (IPFS) method. Additionally, this study also addresses the system's scalability in two aspects, (1) scalability, and (2) security. We used a case study-based approach and performed experiments to evaluate the proposed solution's usability and efficiency in terms of query response (i.e., performance), and algorithmic execution (i.e., efficiency). The proposed solution unifies blockchain technologies to secure IoT-driven systems and provides guidelines to engineer and develop next-generation of robust and secure blockchain-aided distributed IoT systems.	internet of things;blockchain;smart contract;ethereum;decentralized storage;privacy;data securityiot
585	实体经济	Advanced security model for multimedia data sharing in Internet of Things	Sharing a file that contains multimedia data among the different peers of wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks has several challenges. One of the main challenges is their centralized system, which leads to high-security risk and low user reachability. One solution could be to simply change the system to a decentralized network by using the blockchain network to store these files. However, it may solve the low user reachability and security problem at the cost of low latency, longer response time, scalability and privacy issues. Therefore, this article uses the advanced blockchain scheme and distributes InterPlanetary File System. We also presented the system framework and its working. Finally, we do the security analysis of our proposed system and found that it has strong potential to solve most of the security challenges that traditional system faces. Moreover, our proposed approach can be applied to any file-changing wireless IoT network that needs to exchange multimedia data such as healthcare data, IoT data in wearable devices, traffic data in smart cities, etc.	blockchain;cryptanalysis

Interest in food traceability has gained momentum in response to, among others events, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reinforcing the need for digital food traceability that prevents food fraud and provides reliable information about food. This review will briefly summarize the most common conventional methods available to determine food authenticity before highlighting examples of emerging techniques that can be used to combat food fraud and improve food traceability. A particular focus will be on the concept of FT 4.0 and the significant role of digital solutions and other relevant Industry 4.0 innovations in enhancing food traceability. Based on this review, a possible new research topic, namely FT 4.0, is encouraged to take advantage of the rapid digitalization and technological advances occurring in the era of Industry 4.0. The main FT 4.0 enablers are blockchain, the Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and big data. Digital technologies in the age of Industry 4.0 have significant potential to improve the way food is traced, decrease food waste and reduce vulnerability to fraud opening new opportunities to achieve smarter food traceability. Although most of these emerging technologies are still under development, it is anticipated that future research will overcome current limitations making large-scale applications possible.	artificial intelligence;big data;internet of things;blockchain;digital transformation;food fraud;industry 4;0;iot;real-time surveillance;smart sensorsbig data;blockchain technology;electronic nose;safety;internet;quality;things;future;products;fraud
587	实体经济	An enabling Framework for Blockchain in Tourism	This viewpoint article proposes an enabling framework that identifies the use of various blockchain technologies in tourism and their applications (digitalization, automation, disintermediation, and intelligent environment) across the different stages of travel (pre-trip, during the trip, and post-trip). As we know, the tourism sector contributes immensely to world GDP and job creation. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, even after two years since it first appeared, continues to adversely impact the tourism prospects of countries across the world due to nationwide lockdowns and travel restrictions. As the world tries to adapt to the "new normal," the tourism sector is forced to re-think its ways of doing business and bring about innovations to facilitate the new norms of contactless and safe transactions. Also, the sector, more than ever, need to effectively deal with its inherent challenges such as transparency and credibility of information, fraudulent practices, opportunistic behavior of intermediaries, and foreign currency risks. Blockchain technology can transform the tourism sector by offering innovative solutions that address its pressing issues. However, our current understanding of blockchain application in tourism is quite limited, with previous work being largely fragmented and narrow in terms of both scope and application. We foresee that the insights offered in this viewpoint, including the framework, will advance both theory and practice and facilitate the implementation of blockchain-enabled solutions across different travel stages.	cryptocurrency;automation;intelligent environments;digitalization;disintermediation;smart tourism;blockchain technology;covid-19industry;technologies

589	核心技术	Improving transaction succeed ratio in payment channel networks via enhanced node connectivity and balanced channel capacity	Payment channel networks (PCNs) are generally regarded as one of the most effective and promising scalability solutions for blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems, but suffer the issues of low success ratio and long confirmation latency in processing transactions. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of tremendously increasing the success ratio of transactions and improving their execution efficiency by enhancing network nodes' connectivity and enforcing a balanced network channel capacity. To implement such ideas, multiple designs have been made. First, to extent nodes connectivity, we transform the nearly-linear ordered nodes into a star payment structured typology, and design an incentive financing mechanism to restructure a new landmark routing typology design. Especially, for the marginalized or dissociative nodes, we utilize specific financial loan strategies to encourage them to (re)join the system. Besides, we propose the Power Atomic Multi-Path Payments (Power AMP) traffic distribution method, which hierarchically allocates the bottleneck's currently-available capacity (to replace the random or equal division used in traditional AMP), and thus archives a balanced traffic usage. With such efforts, we improve the transaction success ratio and efficiency of transaction exertion by order of magnitude-compared with traditional PCN using the benchmark of landmark route, our method improves the success ratio by 11.06%.	blockchain;payment channel networks;transactions

Under the designed matrix-weighted consensus algorithm, based on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, coupling gains, and discrete interval, we build some consensus conditions for reaching discrete-time consensus and deduce some simplified and straightforward consensus conditions for undirected network topology. Besides, for a given network topology, we theoretically analyze the influence of the coupling gains and discrete intervals on the consensus conditions of the network dynamics. Finally, we offer several simulation examples to validate the obtained results.	network topology;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;couplings;topology;laplace equations;symmetric matrices;multi-agent systems;consensus;discrete time;matrix weighted;multiagent systems (mass);second orderswitching topology;synchronization;networks;dynamics;agents
591	核心技术	GPBFT: A Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Algorithm Based on Dual Administrator Short Group Signatures	The practical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm reduces the operational complexity of Byzantine protocols from an exponential level to a polynomial level, which makes it possible to apply Byzantine protocols in distributed systems. However, it still has some problems, such as high communication overhead, low security, poor scalability, and difficulty in tracking. In this article, we propose a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm based on dual administrator short group signatures (GPBFT). Firstly, the certification authority chooses the master node and group administrators based on the credit value. The group administrators organize the nodes into a group, and the members generate the signatures by applying the short group signatures scheme, in which any group member can represent the group during the GroupSign phase. Additionally, the GPBFT algorithm adds the Trace phase. According to member and client authentication information, the group administrator can track the true identity of the malicious node, identify the malicious node, and revoke it. The experimental results show that compared with the PBFT algorithm, the GPBFT algorithm can reduce the network communication overhead, reduce the consensus delay, and greatly improve the security and stability of the system. The algorithm can effectively manage member nodes and enable the tracking of identified malicious nodes while maintaining anonymity in terms of node tracking.	
592	实体经济	Theorizing the impact of network characteristics on multitier sustainable supply chain governance: a power perspective	Purpose While the literature on multitier supply chain management traditionally assumes that first-tier suppliers belong to the visible proportion of the supply base, intermediaries might limit focal firms' visible horizon already at this stage. High power asymmetries promoting centrality and complexity in the supply network are seen as a particular root cause that limits the impact of governance mechanisms for sustainability. To map the space for governance mechanisms in a network-sensitive context more comprehensively, the study analyzes supply network characteristics from a power perspective. Design/methodology/approach This research is conceptual. To better understand power imbalances and mutual dependencies from network centrality and complexity, network configurations were constructed drawing on resource dependence theory. These configurations allow deducing the impact of (non-)mediated governance mechanisms for a sustainable development in the supply network. An agenda to stimulate future empirical and model-based research is accordingly presented. Findings The research shows that those networks with densely interconnected first-tier suppliers promote network centrality and complexity, leading to an inverted U-shape relationship between the focal firm's exertion of coercive power and the sustainability performance in the supply network. The findings allow a more comprehensive theoretical grounding for mapping governance approaches in a network-sensitive context and provide insights on how to avoid negative effects from power asymmetries. Practical implications The findings suggest the need for accompanying, indirect governance mechanisms already at the stage of first-tier suppliers based on non-mediated forms of power, such as referent power, also promoting disintermediation. Purchasing companies may also consider using digital platform technologies that foster disintermediation, such as blockchain technology. Originality/value By studying intermediaries from a power and network perspective, the conceptualization adds to the discussion on governance in multitier sustainable supply chain networks in various industries. Furthermore, it contributes to the increasing efforts of middle-range theorizing in logistics and supply chain management. The results partially challenge previous assumptions on the moderating role of specific network characteristics.	supply chain governance;power asymmetry;sustainable supply chain management;supply networksmanagement;food;collaboration;complexity;dependence;blockchain;innovation;logistics;responses;systems
593	实体经济	Testing the adoption of Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain Management among MSMEs in China	Supply chain (SC) digitalization has become a new trend in the development of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs). Blockchain technology (BCT) is a cutting-edge innovation that many supply chain management (SCM) professionals have already adopted. Although studies on BCT have yielded some findings, they do not provide sufficient discussion regarding BCT adoption in SCs among MSMEs. Moreover, the determinants and effects of BCT adoption on SCM among MSMEs remain unclear. This study aims to bridge these gaps by helping understand individual BCT adoption in the SC domain in Chinese MSMEs. Using the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, this study examines the effects of BCT, organizational, and environmental contexts on BCT adoption in MSMEs' SCs. The findings reveal that cost saving, complexity, relative advantage, top management support, SC cooperation, and government support positively affect BCT adoption in SCM. Whereas, compatibility, technological readiness, financial readiness, and competitive pressure had no significant impact on BCT adoption in SCM among MSMEs in China.	supply chain management;msmes;blockchain technology adoptionroles;determinants;companies;business;service

Blockchain technology for the protection of refugees and migrants	Blockchain technology has applications that can revolutionize political and economic governance. Although most of the academic literature on blockchain has focused on Bitcoin, there is a need to look at the feasibility of new humanitarian applications. This study will proceed in two steps. First, it surveys current theoretical and practical work on how blockchain can be used to help protect the human rights of migrants and refugees, primarily through creation of digital identities. Then it conducts a critical examination of two major cases: the Building Blocks initiative by the World Food Programme in Jordan and the Rohingya Project. We find that blockchain can be useful in empowering vulnerable individuals, but the empowerment of organizations creates potential human rights risks, such as the infringement of privacy and discrimination. Therefore, adequate safeguards should be in place to ensure that blockchain initiatives meet their true purposes of protecting the most vulnerable groups.	artificial-intelligence;human-rights;dehumanization;bitcoin
595	协同技术	Three-stage auction scheme for computation offloading on mobile blockchain with edge computing	Blockchain has been applied in wide range of fields to guarantee security. However, it has been very challenging for blockchain to flourish in mobile environment with limited resources. Existing studies mainly assume that single mobile user can buy the whole resources from edge servers in mobile blockchain. This paper formulates the problem of maximizing the social welfare for computation offloading in mobile blockchain. A three-stage auction scheme with approximation ratio of (1-epsilon)$$ \left(1-\epsilon \right) $$ based on group-buying mechanism is proposed to allocate edge server resources for mobile blockchain applications. In the first stage, the miners are divided into groups, and a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves based auction is proposed to determine the bid of each group for each edge server. In the second stage, a matching algorithm is proposed to match edge servers and Access Points for maximizing the profit of edge servers. In the third stage, the edge server resources are allocated to mobile users for mining base on the results in the above stages. We prove that our auction scheme guarantees truthfulness, individual rationality and budget balance. Simulation results show that, the social welfare of our scheme is improved by 33.78%, 21.84%, 19.69%, and 6.69% for 1000 miners, compared with the existing works.	auction;edge computing;mobile blockchain;resource allocation
596	虚拟经济	To sell public or private goods	Traditional analysis takes the public or private nature of goods as given. However, technological advances, particularly related to digital goods such as non-fungible tokens, increasingly make rivalry a choice variable of the designer. This paper addresses the question of when a profit-maximizing seller prefers to provide an asset as a private good or as a public good. While the public good is subject to a free-rider problem, a profit-maximizing seller or designer faces a nontrivial quantity-exclusivity tradeoff, and so profits from collecting small payments from multiple agents can exceed the large payment from a single agent. We provide conditions under which the profit from the public good exceeds that from a private good. If the cost of production is sufficiently, but not excessively, large, then production is profitable only for the public good. Moreover, if the lower bound of the support of the buyers' value distribution is positive, then the profit from the public good is unbounded in the number of buyers, whereas the profit from selling the private good is never more than the upper bound of the support minus the cost. As the variance of the agents' distribution becomes smaller, public goods eventually outperform private goods, reflecting intuition based on complete information models, in which public goods always outperform private goods in terms of revenue.	revenue maximization;public goods;mechanism design;non-fungible token (nft);bilateral tradeefficient mechanisms;auction

"Axie Infinity" (AI) is currently the most popular PTE game, occupying a large portion of the online gaming market. In this paper, we profile the risks and benefits of PTE gaming, with a specific focus on AI. Qualitative data in the form of online chat threads was evaluated via a Thematic Analysis (TA) approach. The analysis revealed a number of themes including the dominance of extrinsically motivated gameplay in conjunction with negative appraisals of game quality, the benefits and costs of play, and the potential for PTE scholarship models to be associated with exploitation. The results did, however, indicate awareness of potential consumer risks. The findings have implications for informing consumer education, regulation, as well as areas of focus in future quantitative research.	play to earn;axie infinity;online gaming;cryptocurrencylabor

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-face-to-face further accelerated the activation of the Metaverse. The Metaverse has the attractiveness of arousing user interest, high service scalability, and the potential to combine multiple revenue models. Therefore, many industries are adopting the Metaverse. The Republic of Korea has been on a ceasefire, since 1953, after the Korean War. After the war, the DMZ was decided in an area of 2 km from north to south (total of 4 km), centered on the Military Demarcation Line (MDL). The DMZ area is the largest nature conservation area in Asia and a military area where public access is strictly restricted. The Ministry of Unification is trying to reduce tensions and establish peace in the DMZ area by raising the interest of Korean people, as well as people around the world, through the DMZ Metaverse application. The Korean government has its own e-Government framework and cloud operating environments. In order to adopt the Metaverse to Korean government agencies and operate them sustainably, it is essential to support the e-Government framework and the cloud environments. In this paper, the design features, architecture, models, and functions of OnTwins, a Metaverse platform serviceable in the Korean government IT operating environment, are elaborated in detail. The DMZ Metaverse public service built on the platform will also be introduced. Finally, after comparing it with other Metaverse platforms, future research directions are discussed.	metaverse;web3d;digital twin;virtual world;vr;arengine
599	协同技术	A Trust-Centric Privacy-Preserving Blockchain for Dynamic Spectrum Management in IoT Networks	Blockchain is a promising technology for future dynamic spectrum access (DSA) management due to its decentralization, immutability, and traceability. However, many challenges need to be addressed to integrate the blockchain to DSA, such as the trustworthiness of participating nodes' spectrum sensing results, privacy protection of sensing nodes' identities, and affordable lightweight consensus algorithms for IoT devices. In this article, we propose a trust-centric privacy-preserving blockchain for DSA in IoT networks. To be specific, we propose a trust evaluation mechanism to evaluate the trustworthiness of sensing nodes and design a Proof-of-Trust (PoT) consensus mechanism to build a scalable blockchain with high transaction-per-second (TPS). Moreover, a privacy protection scheme is proposed to protect sensors' real-time geolocation information when they upload sensing data to the blockchain. Two smart contracts are designed to make the whole procedure (spectrum sensing, spectrum auction, and spectrum allocation) run automatically. Simulation results demonstrate the expected computation cost of the PoT consensus algorithm for reliable nodes is low, and the cooperative sensing performance is improved with the help of the trust evaluation mechanism. In addition, incentivization and security are also analyzed, which show that our system can not only encourage nodes' participation, but also resist many kinds of attacks which are frequently arise in the trust management mechanism and blockchain-based IoT systems.	blockchains;sensors;smart contracts;consensus algorithm;privacy;protocols;radio spectrum management;blockchain;consensus algorithm;cooperative spectrum sensing;dynamic spectrum access (dsa);trust model

601	实体经济	Blockchain Technology and Artificial Intelligence Based Decentralized Access Control Model to Enable Secure Interoperability for Healthcare	Healthcare, one of the most important industries, is data-oriented, but most of the research in this industry focuses on incorporating the internet of things (IoT) or connecting medical equipment. Very few researchers are looking at the data generated in the healthcare industry. Data are very important tools in this competitive world, as they can be integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to promote sustainability. Healthcare data include the health records of patients, drug-related data, clinical trials data, data from various medical equipment, etc. Most of the data management processes are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. Even then, different healthcare industries do not trust each other to share and collaborate on data. Distributed ledger technology is being used for innovations in different sectors including healthcare. This technology can be incorporated to maintain and exchange data between different healthcare organizations, such as hospitals, insurance companies, laboratories, pharmacies, etc. Various attributes of this technology, such as its immutability, transparency, provenance etc., can bring trust and security to the domain of the healthcare sector. In this paper, a decentralized access control model is proposed to enable the secure interoperability of different healthcare organizations. This model uses the Ethereum blockchain for its implementation. This model interfaces patients, doctors, chemists, and insurance companies, empowering the consistent and secure exchange of data. The major concerns are maintaining a history of the transactions and avoiding unauthorized updates in health records. Any transaction that changes the state of the data is reflected in the distributed ledger and can be easily traced with this model. Only authorized entities can access their respective data. Even the administrator will not be able to modify any medical records.	blockchain;content identifier;digitalization;artificial intelligence;blockchainrecords
602	实体经济	LSP: Lightweight Smart-Contract-Based Transaction Prioritization Scheme for Smart Healthcare	In recent years, several blockchain-based models have emerged to provide a secure way to store and access sensitive electronic medical records (EMRs) across the healthcare sector. These records are of different priorities and business requirements. From our comprehensive literature review, we observe that the existing models have no provision of prioritizing the EMR transactions. This critically affects the quick and streamline sharing of emergency EMRs in a smart healthcare environment. Furthermore, the lack of prioritization significantly restricts the optimal usage of the blockchain network. Motivated by this, we first propose a lightweight and deterministic method to prioritize the flow of emergency healthcare transactions through the smart contract. We also propose logical stateless transaction models for different entities involved in the system with varying levels of trust. Finally, the performance of the model based on the private Ethereum is verified and it outperforms the existing benchmark model in terms of usefulness in the healthcare setting and computation overhead with the use of a simple prioritizing algorithm. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme in the real-time smart healthcare system.	blockchains;hospitals;internet of things;smart contracts;hafnium;electronic medical records;sorting;blockchain;electronic medical records (emrs);prioritization;smart contract;smart healthcare;transaction modelsblockchain;bitcoin;stroke;time

The blockchain is mainly managed through peer-to-peer networks which comparatively involves in adhering to the protocol of authenticating various blocks to form the blockchain. The usage of blockchain technology has been increasingly used in different fields, and healthcare services are now using blockchain for better patient delivery, detecting disease, and other aspects. The scope of the proposed study is that this study has exploited the function of a blockchain-enabled big data network to support medical professionals in giving better treatment modalities and delivering better patient care. The application of a new generation of smart block chains such as Ethereum and NEM is now offering better services and features in creating blockchain-based healthcare data management and hence support healthcare centers, medical practitioners, nurses, radiologists, and patients for better healthcare management. The application of blockchain technology in big data networks supports adding more value as it results in enhanced data quality, accessibility, and support in creating better security and safety of data and information, which is highly essential in the medical industry. Blockchain technology enables big data technologies enabled in supporting medical practitioners in addressing various healthcare ailments; one of the major diseases impacting many people around the world is diabetes. Patients with such ailments tend to generate more data and information related to the disease and health-related aspects. Hence, this information requires being maintained and analyzed, so that superior healthcare services can be provided. This study is more involved in the investigation of blockchain technology through a big data network enabled in offering better care for elderly individuals who have been affected due to diabetes, the researchers propose to choose a questionnaire method to collect the data from nearly 169 respondents, and these data were then analyzed using SPSS data package. The analyst used percentage analysis, correlation analysis, and chi-square test to analyze the data which has been collated by the researchers. The results and discussion show in detail the major aspects of blockchain technology in supporting healthcare professionals for better diabetes care management for elderly individuals.	
604	协同技术	Dynamic Access Control and Trust Management for Blockchain-Empowered IoT	The Internet of Things (IoT), while providing comprehensive interconnection and ubiquitous services, poses security issues by enabling resources sharing among various devices from different untrusted authorities. Blockchain, as a distributed ledger, provides a traceable and verifiable platform to ensure the secure access control in IoT. The existing works based on blockchain may bring up intolerable computing overhead and delay to the lightweight IoT devices. In this article, we propose a dynamic and lightweight attribute-based access control framework for blockchain-empowered IoT, to achieve secure and fine-grained authorization. The proposed scheme allows access to resources by evaluating attributes, operations, and the environment relevant to a request. The access policy is executed through smart contract in blockchain for security and flexibility. To further adapt to IoT device constraints, we design a access control framework based on decentralized application (DApp), which can maintain tamper proof in a timely manner and be adapt to the delay-intolerant application. When delay-intolerant access is required, access can be allowed according to local replica of the blockchain, without a consensus of blockchain network. Considering the time-varying attributes of IoT devices, a trust management scheme is proposed based on the Markov chain to resist the security fluctuation caused by the vulnerability of IoT devices. In the experiments, we deploy our system prototype on Ethereum to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the scheme. The results show the proposed scheme can achieve secure, high throughput, and flexible access control in IoT.	internet of things;security;smart contracts;authorization;smart homes;trust management;logic gates;access control;blockchain;internet of things (iot);smart contract;trust managementinternet;security;things
605	协同技术	Efficient privacy protection authentication protocol for vehicle network in 5G	The traditional internet of vehicles (IoV) identity authentication system generally has the security risk that the center is not trusted. In the 5G IoV, a large number of deployed 5G base stations are integrated into it, which has further developed the technologies such as seamless handover, load balancing, and security authentication. The development of the IoV has largely alleviated the traffic pressure and improved the driving efficiency. However, there are many privacy security problems to be solved in 5G IoV. Therefore, with the characteristics of blockchain distribution, traceability, and non-tampering, an efficient privacy protection authentication protocol based on blockchain is proposed. The method includes two parts: identity registration and authentication. Vehicles and other traffic participants obtain a public identity block through identity registration before accessing the IoV. In the subsequent authentication, the communication parties use this identity block for anonymous authentication. The analysis results based on the formal analysis software Scyther are safe. The security analysis shows that the scheme could meet the security requirements in the IoV. At the same time, the comparison with the existing schemes shows that this scheme has lower computation overhead and communication cost.	5g;authentication;blockchain;internet of vehicles;securitysecurity;scheme;technologies;signature
606	实体经济	PROACT: Parallel multi-miner proof of accumulated trust protocol for Internet of Drones	Several types of networks that comprise unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV or drone) are being utilized in important applications such as emergency response, environment and infrastructure monitoring, defense and security, and commerce. In such networks, swarms of UAVs cooperate in executing one or more missions to achieve the application's objectives. The UAVs communicate with terrestrial networks by connecting to fixed or mobile ground control stations (GCS). The ability of drones to connect to online applications and offer services to Internet users has led to the proliferation of the Internet of Drones (IoD). However, IoD applications are highly vulnerable to many types of cyberattacks. Hence, mechanisms must be deployed to secure the IoD operations and data. Recently, the blockchain has been proposed as a solution to detect and prevent malicious attacks on the UAV network (UAVN). Due to the UAV's limited resources, it becomes a challenge to integrate the blockchain into the IoD. In this paper, we propose a model that enables a drone to store the important data that it requires during its flight within a lightweight blockchain system. In addition, we propose a new blockchain consensus mechanism in which several miners produce their blocks in parallel, which decreases the time needed to add transactions securely to the blockchain and meets the requirements of delay-sensitive applications. Our simulations prove the advantages of the proposed model in decreasing the transaction-to-blockchain delay, the average drone energy consumption, and the blockchain block size as compared to other IoD blockchain systems.

607	市场治理	Cryptocurrencies and the IPE of money: an agenda for research	Despite the exploding interest in cryptocurrencies in the markets in recent years, the political economy study of them, in particular as money, remains underdeveloped. This seems quite surprising, given the otherwise extensive research on money and finance in the international political economy (IPE) literature. This essay calls for a greater engagement of IPE scholarship in analyzing cryptocurrencies as money. It argues first that theories of money-in particular, the "commodity theory of money" and the "state theory of money"-could provide valuable theoretical insights for the IPE study of cryptocurrencies as money. It then suggests how these insights can be incorporated into that research, drawing particular attention to analysis of the political dynamics surrounding cryptocurrencies' development as money.	bitcoin;commodity theory of money;cryptoasset;cryptocurrency;digital currency;digital money;theories of money;state theory of moneyinfrastructures

609	实体经济	BBNP: A Blockchain-Based Novel Paradigm for Fair and Secure Smart Grid Communications	As the future energy infrastructure, smart grid aims to overcome the disadvantages of traditional power grid, e.g., low efficiency and unstable service. However, the frequent collection and analysis of the user's electricity data may bring various security and privacy threats. Besides, the traditional centralized data storage model in the smart grid is prone to the single point of failure. To address these challenges, in this article, for fair and secure smart grid communication, a blockchain-based novel paradigm, named BBNP, is proposed. Specifically, based on the pseudorandom function and auxiliary information generation and sharing technology, a lightweight data aggregation protocol is designed first to protect the user's data privacy and ensure communication confidentiality. Then, a novel efficient authentication mechanism is proposed to generate and share session keys in a noninteractive way, which is leveraged for MAC authentication to achieve data integrity of the transmitted data. After that, based on the subjective logic reputation model, a blockchain node consensus mechanism is studied to efficiently store smart grid big data and effectively solve the single point failure problem. By constructing the long-term reputation model for consensus nodes (CNs) and integrating batch verification technology, the problems of CN fair selection and scalability of large-scale nodes are solved simultaneously. Finally, the performance evaluation indicates that BBNP outperforms the state-of-the-art similar schemes in computing complexity, communication cost, system availability, and fairness of block generation.	smart grids;blockchains;data integrity;data models;data aggregation;privacy;data privacy;blockchain;data aggregation;reputation;smart gridpreserving data aggregation;privacy;lightweight;scheme
610	实体经济	A Solution for Bilayer Energy-Trading Management in Microgrids Using Multiblockchain	In recent years, microgrids have attracted much attention as one of the typical applications of the Internet of Things (IoT). With the development of renewable energy, a bilayer energy-trading scenario of microgrids has emerged. In the upper layer, the microgrids trade energy with each other, and in the lower layer, users trade energy within the microgrid. Traditional management schemes based on the cooperation mode or island mode of the microgrids can no longer meet the needs of energy trading. In this article, we propose an energy-trading management solution for the bilayer energy-trading scenario. In order to maximize the bilayer's [i.e., users' and microgrid operators' (MGOs)] utility functions under the condition of the local energy supply and demand, we propose a multiobjective optimization model. To solve the optimization model, we give a solution energy-trading management algorithm (ETMA) based on the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA). Moreover, the proposed energy-trading framework that is based on the multiblockchain ensures the security and privacy of energy trading, and a consensus mechanism named the Delegated Proof of Reputation (DPoR) is proposed to urge users to complete the transaction according to their promised trading schemes. Experiments based on the real data of Guizhou are done to evaluate the performance of the proposed optimization model. The results show that our proposed model can achieve better performance in terms of users' and MGOs' utility functions in the bilayer energy-trading scenario compared with the traditional models.	microgrids;optimization;costs;security;renewable energy sources;blockchains;privacy;blockchain;energy internet;energy trading;microgridnetworked microgrids;blockchain;state

612	核心技术	A Hierarchy Byzantine Fault Tolerance Consensus Protocol Based on Node Reputation	A blockchain has been applied in many areas, such as cryptocurrency, smart cities and digital finance. The consensus protocol is the core part of the blockchain network, which addresses the problem of transaction consistency among the involved participants. However, the scalability, efficiency and security of the consensus protocol are greatly restricted with the increasing number of nodes. A Hierarchy Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus protocol (HBFT) based on node reputation has been proposed. The two-layer hierarchy structure is designed to improve the scalability by assigning nodes to different layers. Each node only needs to exchange messages within its group, which deducts the communication complexity between nodes. Specifically, a reputation model is proposed to distinguish normal nodes from malicious ones by a punish and reward mechanism. It is applied to ensure that the malicious node merely existing in the bottom layer and the communication complexity in the high layer can be further lowered. Finally, a random selection mechanism is applied in the selection of the leader node. The mechanism can ensure the security of the blockchain network with the characteristics of unpredictability and randomicity. Some experimental results demonstrated that the proposed consensus protocol has excellent performance in comparison to some state-of-the-art models.	consensus protocol;reputation model;hierarchy structure;random selection mechanismblockchain networks;scheme
613	实体经济	Governmental Anti-Pandemic and Subsidy Strategies for Blockchain-Enabled Food Supply Chains in the Post-Pandemic Era	Aiming to explore whether governments should choose anti-pandemic or subsidy strategies in the post-pandemic era, this study constructed a three-level food supply chain that was composed of a leading third-party logistics provider, a supplier and a retailer, in which the third-party logistics provider used blockchain technology for food traceability to address consumer concerns about food safety. We then used game theory to analyze the pricing decisions, traceability levels, anti-pandemic effort levels and subsidy levels of the supply chain under different governmental anti-pandemic or subsidy strategies. Our results showed that in all scenarios, the higher the consumer preference for traceability information, the larger the traceability levels and anti-pandemic effort levels and the more favorable the outcome for all parties; thus, governments should improve consumer awareness of pandemic prevention. For the benefit of all parties, governments should adopt anti-pandemic and subsidy strategies simultaneously, even in the post-pandemic era. Interestingly, for the scenario in which governments could only adopt one strategy, when the cost coefficient of traceability was small, the governmental subsidies would actually lead to lower traceability levels of the 3PL. This study could provide decision-making references for governments during the post-pandemic era and a new possibility for blockchain application.	three-level food supply chain;blockchain technology;governmental strategy selection;traceability;game theorytechnology;selection;roles;model
614	核心技术	Distributed Ledger Technologies and Their Applications: A Review	With the success of Bitcoin and the introduction of different uses of Blockchain, such as smart contracts in Ethereum, many researchers and industries have turned their attention to applications that use this technology. In response to the advantages and disadvantages of Blockchain, similar technologies have emerged with alterations to the original structure. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a generalized distributed technology encompassing these new variants. Several studies have examined the challenges and applications of Blockchain technology. This article explores the possibilities of using different DLTs to solve traditional distributed computing problems based on their advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we provide an overview and comparison of different DLTs, such as Hashgraph, Tangle, Blockchains, Side Chain and Holochain. The main objective of the article is to examine whether distributed ledger technologies can replace traditional computational methods in other areas instead of traditional methods. Based on the primary keywords, we conducted a systematic review of more than 200 articles. Based on the data extracted from articles related to the use of DLT, we conclude that that DLTs can complement other methods, but cannot completely replace them. Furthermore, several DLTs such as Sidechain, Holochain and Hashgraph are still in their infancy, and we foresee much research work in this area in the coming years.	blockchain technology;distributed ledger technology (dlt);applications of dltblockchain technology;security;challenges
615	协同技术	SDBlockEdge: SDN-Blockchain Enabled Multihop Task Offloading in Collaborative Edge Computing	In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained tremendous attention and exponential growth in every domain of life. However, these devices face many challenges due to the limited resources in terms of storage and computation. Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) is an emerging paradigm that solves these issues where multiple edge devices share computational resources to collaborate and satisfy user requirements. The fundamental issues in CEC are to make an offloading decision while considering the flow scheduling and balancing the load over multiple edge devices. Moreover, the efficient resource allocation of edge nodes is challenging, particularly when IoT devices are more vulnerable and become resource-hungry. The combination of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain (BC) can play a vital role in solving the issues mentioned above. This paper presents a token-based resource management mechanism as SDBlockEdge by integrating these two technologies. The programming abstractions and global view of the SDN can help offload decision and flow scheduling, whereas the smart contract mechanism of BC can help control the abnormal behavior of IoT devices. We design the Resource Management Controller (RMC), which collaborates with the SDN controller to keep the record of available resources. It helps for offloading decisions and balancing the load over edge servers, whereas the SDN controller helps consider the less loaded path, while offloading reduces the task completion time. Moreover, the resources are allocated against tokens, and smart contracts are used to pay the cost of these resources. The proposed approach is implemented in Mininet_WiFi and Containernet, where docker hosts act as edge nodes with different IoT devices. The results after the extensive simulation show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.	internet of things;task analysis;servers;behavioral sciences;smart contracts;blockchains;software defined networking;software defined networking (sdn);internet of things (iot);blockchain;edge computing;resource managementframework;algorithm;internet
616	实体经济	BEST-Blockchain-Enabled Secure and Trusted Public Emergency Services for Smart Cities Environment	In the last few years, the Internet of things (IoT) has recently gained attention in developing various smart city applications such as smart healthcare, smart supply chain, smart home, smart grid, etc. The existing literature focuses on the smart healthcare system as a public emergency service (PES) to provide timely treatment to the patient. However, little attention is given to a distributed smart fire brigade system as a PES to protect human life and properties from severe fire damage. The traditional PES are developed on a centralised system, which requires high computation and does not ensure timely service fulfilment. Furthermore, these traditional PESs suffer from a lack of trust, transparency, data integrity, and a single point of failure issue. In this context, this paper proposes a Blockchain-Enabled Secure and Trusted (BEST) framework for PES in the smart city environment. The BEST framework focuses on providing a fire brigade service as a PES to the smart home based on IoT device information to protect it from serious fire damage. Further, we used two edge computing servers, an IoT controller and a service controller. The IoT and service controller are used for local storage and to enhance the data processing speed of PES requests and PES fulfilments, respectively. The IoT controller manages an access control list to keep track of registered IoT gateways and their IoT devices, avoiding misguiding the PES department. The service controller utilised the queue model to handle the PES requests based on the minimum service queue length. Further, various smart contracts are designed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform to automatically call a PES either in the presence or absence of the smart-home owner under uncertain environmental conditions. The performance evaluation of the proposed BEST framework indicates the benefits of utilising the distributed environment and the smart contract logic. The various simulation results are evaluated in terms of service queue length, utilisation, actual arrival time, expected arrival time, number of PES departments, number of PES providers, and end-to-end delay. These simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the BEST framework.	internet of things;blockchain;public emergency service;smart contracts;queue model;reputation modelinternet;scheme
617	实体经济	A Novel Block Chain Method for Urban Digitization Governance in Birth Registration Field: A Case Study	Even though digitization is widely recognized as one of the most imperative trends in achieving effective urban governance, digital infrastructure remains far from the global trend in many African countries. This paper proposes a novel, resilient data manipulation architecture model called the Birth Notification Verification Model (BNVM) using blockchain and smart contracts. The proposed solution was evaluated in a real-world use case scenario in Ghana. The model, which is based on the Ten Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Framework, focuses on the initial inputs for birth registration at the birth notification level. The approach presented in this study paves the way for the creation of decentralized, secure, transparent, and automated systems for civil registration. The application of a smart contract architecture that blends a centralized design with an on-chain and off-chain architecture is further supported by this, providing more evidence of its viability. It offers a safe verification framework for the Ghana Birth and Death Registry based on smart contract technology and can guarantee a birth notification as proof of birth certificate registration in accordance with international standards. The findings provide insight into the use of blockchain technology in public registry institutions. Furthermore, exploring its adoption and implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa contributes to the growing field of blockchain technology research and demonstrates how the concept will address long-standing issues with corruption and security in developing countries.	civil registration;block chain;digitization governance;smart contractsystems

Furthermore, the usage of cloud computation lowers the cost of microcontrollers by reducing their complexity.

We present a platform based on IoMT to allow the monitoring of patient's health. To meet the constraint of medical secrecy and confidentiality of information, we will use the Blockchain as a secure system. Our system will use the data collected by several smart sensors such as blood pressure, SPO2 concentration, and EEG signals. These encrypted data will be collected by an embedded Raspberry PI 4 platform (working as a smart data relay) before being processed (on a backend server) and then saved in an embedded Blockchain node. The preliminary results show the effectiveness of the proposed platform as a candidate of a low-cost example of secured Electronic Health Record (EHR).	ehr;blockchain;blood pressure;spo2;eeg;raspberry pi 4;fpgaarchitecture;eeg;efficient;internet;things
621	实体经济	Blockchain Socket Factories with RMI-Enabled Framework for Fine-Grained Healthcare Applications	The usage of digital and intelligent healthcare applications on mobile devices has grown progressively. These applications are generally distributed and access remote healthcare services on the user's applications from different hospital sources. These applications are designed based on client-server architecture and different paradigms such as socket, remote procedure call, and remote method invocation (RMI). However, these existing paradigms do not offer a security mechanism for healthcare applications in distributed mobile-fog-cloud networks. This paper devises a blockchain-socket-RMI-based framework for fine-grained healthcare applications in the mobile-fog-cloud network. This study introduces a new open healthcare framework for applied research purposes and has blockchain-socket-RMI abstraction level classes for healthcare applications. The goal is to meet the security and deadline requirements of fine-grained healthcare tasks and minimize execution and data validation costs during processing applications in the system. This study introduces a partial proof of validation (PPoV) scheme that converts the workload into the hash and validates it among mobile, fog, and cloud nodes during offloading, execution, and storing data in the secure form. Simulation discussions illustrate that the proposed blockchain-socket-RMI minimizes the processing and blockchain costs and meets the security and deadline requirements of fine-grained healthcare tasks of applications as compared to existing frameworks in work.	client-server;rmi;blockchain;socket;storagefog;networks;security
622	实体经济	Blockchain Based Delay and Energy Harvest Aware Healthcare Monitoring System in WBAN Environment	Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are a research area that supports patients with healthcare monitoring. In WBAN, the Internet of Things (IoT) is connected with WBAN for a smart/remote healthcare monitoring system in which various medical diseases are diagnosed. Quality of service (QoS), security and energy efficiency achievements are the major issues in the WBAN-IoT environment. Existing schemes for these three issues fail to achieve them since nodes are resource constrained and hence delay and the energy consumption is minimized. In this paper, a blockchain-assisted delay and energy aware healthcare monitoring (B-DEAH) system is presented in the WBAN-IoT environment. Both body sensors and environment sensors are deployed with dual sinks for emergency and periodical packet transmission. Various processes are involved in this paper, and each process is described as follows: Key registration for patients using an extended version of the PRESENT algorithm is proposed. Cluster formation and cluster head selection are implemented using spotted hyena optimizer. Then, cluster-based routing is established using the MOORA algorithm. For data transmission, the patient block agent (PBA) is deployed and authenticated using the four Q curve asymmetric algorithm. In PBA, three entities are used: classifier and queue manager, channel selector and security manager. Each entity is run by a special function, as packets are classified using two stream deep reinforcement learning (TS-DRL) into three classes: emergency, non-emergency and faulty data. Individual packets are put into a separate queue, which is called emergency, periodical and faulty. Each queue is handled using Reyni entropy. Periodical packets are forwarded by a separate channel without any interference using a multi objective based channel selection algorithm. Then, all packets are encrypted and forwarded to the sink nodes. Simulation is conducted using the OMNeT++ network simulator, in which diverse parameters are evaluated and compared with several existing works in terms of network throughput for periodic (41.75 Kbps) and emergency packets (42.5 Kbps); end-to-end delay for periodic (0.036 s) and emergency packets (0.028 s); packet loss rate (1.1%); residual energy in terms of simulation rounds based on periodic (0.039 J) and emergency packets (0.044 J) and in terms of simulation time based on periodic (8.35 J) and emergency packets (8.53 J); success rate for periodic (87.83%) and emergency packets (87.5%); authentication time (3.25 s); and reliability (87.83%).	wireless body area networks;internet of things;blockchain;secure cluster based routing;quality of service (qos)management;security;mechanism;quality
623	实体经济	A Novel Decentralized Blockchain Architecture for the Preservation of Privacy and Data Security against Cyberattacks in Healthcare	Nowadays, in a world full of uncertainties and the threat of digital and cyber-attacks, blockchain technology is one of the major critical developments playing a vital role in the creative professional world. Along with energy, finance, governance, etc., the healthcare sector is one of the most prominent areas where blockchain technology is being used. We all are aware that data constitute our wealth and our currency; vulnerability and security become even more significant and a vital point of concern for healthcare. Recent cyberattacks have raised the questions of planning, requirement, and implementation to develop more cyber-secure models. This paper is based on a blockchain that classifies network participants into clusters and preserves a single copy of the blockchain for every cluster. The paper introduces a novel blockchain mechanism for secure healthcare sector data management, which reduces the communicational and computational overhead costs compared to the existing bitcoin network and the lightweight blockchain architecture. The paper also discusses how the proposed design can be utilized to address the recognized threats. The experimental results show that, as the number of nodes rises, the suggested architecture speeds up ledger updates by 63% and reduces network traffic by 10 times.	blockchain;healthcare;cyber security;cyberattackinteroperability;framework;systems
624	协同技术	A Novel Distributed Ledger Technology Structure for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on IOTA Tangle	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) consist of many wireless sensor nodes for collecting and sensing information. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) such as Blockchain allow organizations to store and share data in a decentralized, immutable, and secure way through a network of distributed peer-to-peer users or computers. The application of DLT to the Internet of Things (IoT) can improve the efficiency of information transmission and network security. IOTA Tangle is a DLT developed for IoT to process transactions. WSN is a core technology for IoT, and the two have a lot in common in terms of applications. Many solutions for IoT applications can be implemented with WSNs. However, the sensor nodes in WSNs have limited processing speed, storage capacity, communication bandwidth, and energy consumption capabilities. Therefore, a lightweight solution needs to be designed according to the characteristics of WSNs, rather than directly applying Tangle. The similarities between IoT and WSNs determine that the Tangle can be an essential reference for designing new solutions. In this paper, we propose a new DLT structure based on Tangle named Fishing Net Topology (FNT). The aim is to meet the lightweight requirements of sensor nodes in WSNs. We compared FNT with Tangle in terms of the packet network structure and algorithm and also experimentally analyzed the waste rate in the FNT network. It is concluded that FNT can be used at a reasonable Rate based on the requirement of the WSN applications, and it can significantly reduce the computation while enhancing the security of WSNs. Due to its structural stability and algorithmic simplicity, FNT outperforms Tangle in WSNs.	wireless sensor networks (wsns);internet of things (iot);distributed ledger technology (dlt);blockchain;iota tangle;network topology;wsn securityperformance evaluation;node detection;internet;things

In this regard, researchers have proposed IIoT architectures based on different architectural layers and emerging technologies for the end-to-end integration of IIoT systems. In this paper, we review and compare three widely accepted IIoT reference architectures and present a state-of-the-art review of conceptual and experimental IIoT architectures from the literature. We identified scalability, interoperability, security, privacy, reliability, and low latency as the main IIoT architectural requirements and detailed how the current architectures address these challenges by using emerging technologies such as edge/fog computing, blockchain, SDN, 5G, Machine Learning, and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Finally, we discuss the relation between the current challenges and emergent technologies and present some opportunities and directions for future research work.	blockchain;edge;fog computing;iiot architectures;industry 4;0;interoperability;low latency;reliability;scalability;security;software-defined networkinginternet;security;privacy;systems

In addition, demand response for saving the power consumption is also important. In this paper, we propose a design method of distributed energy management systems with real-time demand response, in which both electrical energy and thermal energy are considered. Here, we use ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers), which is well known as one of the powerful methods in distributed optimization. In the proposed method, demand response is performed in real-time, based on the difference between the planned demand and the actual value. Furthermore, utilizing a blockchain is also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is presented by a numerical example. The importance of introducing a blockchain is pointed out by presenting the adverse effect of tampering the actual value.	admm;blockchain;demand response;distributed energy management systems;distributed optimization
627	实体经济	Fiscal Measurement and Oil and Gas Production Market: Increasing Reliability Using Blockchain Technology	Featured Application Use of blockchain technology in the oil and gas market. The market of oil and gas has many particularities, once it is a natural resource of great value. Due to the fact the resource is owned by nations, it is highly regulated. The volumes traded are high; for this reason, their calculation needs to be performed very carefully, meeting not only the uncertainties and metrological control, but also particularly the tracking of the activities. The technical regulations of measurement adopted by the countries carefully follows many guidelines. The reason is that the established volumes directly affect the calculation of royalties and profit sharing in concession agreements or even a simple ownership shift of the products. Therefore, it is an application with a lot of responsibility, involving a large amount of equipment, software, and execution processes. Therefore, the transfer of data among different entities requires total transparency and security. Blockchain technology, which has been initially developed for the financial market, presents itself as an alternative to ensure reliability, from the sensors in the field to the effective generation of the Monthly Report on the petroleum and natural gas production unit, which is the basic document for determining the remuneration of the owners of the product. This paper presents a technical solution for creating the blockchain validation blocks by the MAC (Media Access Control Address) addressing, which in turn comes from the communication boards of the flow computers and from the Supervisory Stations. There are limitations to extending this solution to the level of field sensors due to the current links of communication, but also because of the way that historical, events and alarm databases of the flow computers are generated. Once these devices exhibit an elevated degree of safety in their operation, the solution herein presented adds a high level of reliability in the fiscal measurement and/or custody transfer.	fiscal measurement;flow measurement;blockchain technologysupply-chain;internet;flow;performance;impact
628	虚拟经济	Leveraging Blockchain and Smart Contract Technologies to Overcome Circular Economy Implementation Challenges	Adopting a circular economy (CE) has rapidly emerged among policymakers and business community stakeholders to promote material circularization and ensure sustainable development. While the inclination for a paradigm shift away from the linear economy is evident, many challenges have been quoted in the literature regarding its implementation. Lately, it has become common to propose Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)-based approaches to address these challenges. However, they do not question the practicality of the solutions in the context of CE. This paper aims to find an appropriate digital solution for CE implementation, which is not possible without a complete understanding of the existing challenges. A thorough literature review broadly classified the challenges under five barrier categories: Technological, Financial, Infrastructural, Institutional, and Societal, which was followed up with an investigation into the failure of ICT solutions to address CE challenges. Among the various technologies, blockchain and smart contract technologies show some promise as data-driven decision-making tools; however, they are not without their limitations when applied in the context of CE. This perspective explores the role of blockchain smart contract technology-scape in overcoming CE challenges and presents a circular economy blockchain (CEB) architecture development. The findings suggest that CEB may enable CE business models that improve trust and transparency in supply-chain networks, shared and performance economy platforms, stakeholder participation, and governance and management of organizations. Ultimately, this study highlights critical areas for research and development for the blockchainification of CE.	circular economy;circular economy limitations;circular economy barriers;digital circular economy;ict in circular economy;blockchain architecture for circular economy;circular economy blockchain;digital circular economy architecturesupply chain;barrier analysis;opportunities;internet;efficient;recovery;waste;integration;furniture;elements
629	实体经济	Blockchain and Double Auction-Based Trustful EVs Energy Trading Scheme for Optimum Pricing	Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained prominence in smart transportation due to their unparalleled benefits of reduced carbon footprints, improved performance, and intelligent energy trading mechanisms. These potential benefits have increased EV adoption at massive scales, but energy management in EVs is a critical study problem. The problem is further intensified due to the scarcity of charging stations (CSs) in near EV proximity. Moreover, as energy transactions occur over open channels, it presents critical security, privacy, and trust issues among decentralized channels. To address the open limitations of trusted energy management and optimize the pricing control among EV entities (i.e., prosumers and consumers), the paper proposes a scheme that integrates blockchain and a truthful double auction strategy for trustful EV trading. To address the transaction scalability, we integrate an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) with a double auction mechanism handled through the Remix Smart Contract environment. The double auction leverages an optimal payoff condition between peer EVs. To address the communication latency, we present the scheme at the backdrop of Fifth Generation (5G) networks that minimizes the optimal payoff response time. The scheme is simulated against parameters such as convergence, profit for consumers, computation time, and blockchain analysis regarding node commit latency, collusion attacks, and EV energy consumption. The results indicate the scheme's viability against traditional (non-blockchain) approaches with high reliability, scalability, and improved cost-efficiency.	blockchain;electric vehicles;ipfs;truthful double auction

Virtualization solutions based on Docker Containers provide a more lightweight and efficient virtual environment for Edge and cloud-based applications. Because their use is growing on its own and is still in its early phases, these technologies will face a slew of security issues. Vulnerabilities and malware in Docker container images are two serious security concerns. The risk of privilege escalation is increased because Docker containers share the Linux kernel. This study presents a distributed system framework called Safe Docker Image Sharing with Homomorphic Encryption and Blockchain (SeDIS-HEB). Through homomorphic encryption, authentication, and access management, SeDIS-HEB provides secure docker image sharing. The SeDIS-HEB framework prioritizes the following three major functions: (1) secure docker image upload, (2) secure docker image sharing, and (3) secure docker image download. The proposed framework was evaluated using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Secure Docker images were uploaded using IPFS, preventing unauthorized users from accessing the data contained within the secure Docker images. The SeDIS-HEB results were transparent and ensured the quality of blockchain data access control authentication, docker image metadata denial-of-service protection, and docker image availability.	cloud computing;secure communication;docker security;homomorphic encryption;virtualization;blockchain;docker image sharing
631	核心技术	Privacy and Auditability in the Local Energy Market of an Energy Community with Homomorphic Encryption	The world of electrical distribution is rapidly changing and is seeing more and more distributed production and steerable flexibilities. Energy communities are seen as an important innovation for the optimization of electrical consumption at a local level. A central need of the local energy markets inside energy communities is the exchange and circulation of production and consumption data, and therefore the problem of the potential leak of sensitive data must be addressed. In this paper, the context of the Lugaggia Innovation Community, a Self Consumption Community pilot project in southern Switzerland, is introduced together with the blockchain framework that was created for its internal market interaction and the rules designed for its local energy market. A cryptographic protocol from the literature, based on homomorphic encryption, is then proposed for the anonymous aggregation of production and consumption data of the individual households at a resolution of 15 min. The computational overhead associated with the protocol is then experimented and analyzed.	energy community;smart grid;local energy markets;homomorphic encryptionblockchain
632	核心技术	Special Subsets of Addresses for Blockchains Using the secp256k1 Curve	In 2020, Sala, Sogiorno and Taufer were able to find the private keys of some Bitcoin addresses, thus being able to spend the cryptocurrency linked to them. This was unexpected since the recovery of non-trivial private keys for blockchain addresses is deemed to be an infeasible problem. In this paper, we widen this analysis by mounting a similar attack on other small subsets of the set of private keys. We then apply it to other blockchains as well, examining Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dash, Zcash and Bitcoin Cash. In addition to the results, we also explain the techniques we have used to perform this exhaustive search for all the addresses that have ever appeared in these blockchains, and we give an estimate of the time needed to perform all the computations. Finally, we also examine the possibility of mounting a similar attack on other elliptic curves used in blockchains, i.e., Curve25519 and NIST P-256.	cryptography;blockchain;bitcoin;elliptic curves;subsets analysis;addresses;wallet
633	核心技术	Blockchain: Consensus Algorithm Key Performance Indicators, Trade-Offs, Current Trends, Common Drawbacks, and Novel Solution Proposals	Consensus protocols stand behind the success of blockchain technology. This is because parties that distrust each other can make secure transactions without the oversight of a central authority. The first consensus protocol emerged with Bitcoin. Since then, many others have appeared. Some of them have been implemented by official blockchain platforms, whereas others, for the time being, remain as proposals. A blockchain consensus is a trade-off. The new solutions promise to overcome the known drawbacks of blockchain, but they may also bring new vulnerabilities. Moreover, blockchain performance metrics are not clearly defined, as some metrics, such as delay and throughput, which are key factors for the efficiency of standard networks, are purposely constrained by most mainstream blockchain platforms. The main body of this paper consolidates knowledge of blockchains, focusing on the seminal consensus protocols in large-scale market capitalization platforms, and how consensus is achieved for large-scale, decentralized, blockchain architectures. The benefits, limitations, and tradeoffs, as well as the subsequent trend in current consensus development, and its limitations as a general paradigm, are highlighted. The paper also sheds light on overlooked potential performance metrics, and it proposes some novel solutions to some of the identified problems.	blockchain;consensus;decentralization;performance metrics;tradeoffs;proposals
634	实体经济	Development of a Blockchain-Based Online Secret Electronic Voting System	This paper presents the design, implementation, and verification of a blockchain-based online electronic voting system that ensures accuracy and reliability in electronic voting and its application to various types of voting using blockchain technologies, such as distributed ledgers and smart contracts. Specifically, in this study, the connection between the electronic voting system and blockchain nodes is simplified using the REST API design, and the voting opening and counting information is designed to store the latest values in the distributed ledger in JSON format, using a smart contract that cannot be falsified. The developed electronic voting system can provide blockchain authentication, secret voting, forgery prevention, ballot verification, and push notification functions, all of which are currently not supported in existing services. Furthermore, the developed system demonstrates excellence on all evaluation items, including 101 transactions per second (TPS) of blockchain online authentication, 57.6 TPS of secret voting services, 250 TPS of forgery prevention cases, 547 TPS of read transaction processing, and 149 TPS of write transaction processing, along with 100% ballot verification service, secret ballot authentication, and encryption accuracy. Functional and performance verifications were obtained through an external test certification agency in South Korea. Our design allows for blockchain authentication, non-forgery of ballot counting data, and secret voting through blockchain-based distributed ledger technology. In addition, we demonstrate how existing electronic voting systems can be easily converted to blockchain-based electronic voting systems by applying a blockchain-linked REST API. This study greatly contributes to enabling electronic voting using blockchain technology through cost reductions, information restoration, prevention of misrepresentation, and transparency enhancement for a variety of different forms of voting.	blockchain;online voting;smart contract;electronic voting

636	实体经济	Improving blockchain performance in clinical trials using intelligent optimal transaction traffic control mechanism in smart healthcare applications	Blockchain technology has revolutionized the ways of processing and storing data in terms of reliability and security. Blockchain plays a pivotal role in transferring the processing hurdle from the client-server to a decentralized and secured platform. Blockchain is deemed to be an efficient technology in a forthcoming era that would beneficiate multifarious industries. An issue that becomes a bottleneck for blockchain-based applications is their restricted ability to process in comparison to distributed database systems. In this paper, we present intelligent traffic control using a hybrid model based on the PSO-based optimization algorithm and fuzzy logic in order to improve blockchain performance. The real-time network feedback model is designed and used as an input to control the transaction traffic across the entire network in a robust way without human intervention. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the designed model, a clinical trial service framework as a test network is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric. The case study is further compared with baseline network, network with fuzzy approach, and network with optimized parameter. The experiments show that the proposed model not only enhanced the network by maximizing the network throughput and minimizing the network latency. A smart contract is implemented to automate the transaction flow as per real-time data of network conditions. An open-source blockchain framework, Hyperledger Fabric, is harnessed for implementation of the experiment environment in order to signify the potential of the proposed model. The outcome of this study indicated a remarkable increase in transaction throughput (i.e., 38.5%) and a decrease in transaction latency of 40.5%. Moreover, the proposed model can easily be integrated with other existing blockchain-based performance-enhancing tools.	blockchain;smartcontract;fuzzylogic;transactiontrafficcontrol;optimization;blockchainperformance

638	协同技术	The Rise of Blockchain Internet of Things (BIoT): Secured, Device-to-Device Architecture and Simulation Scenarios	Most Internet of Things (IoT) resources are exposed to security risks due to their essential functionality. IoT devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have a limited network, computation, and storage capacity, making them more vulnerable to attacks. In addition, the huge volume of data generated by IoT devices remains an open challenge for existing platforms to process, analyze, and discover underlying trends to create a convenient environment. As a result, to deliver acceptable services, a new solution is necessary to secure data accountability, increase data privacy and accessibility, and extract hidden patterns and usable knowledge. Moving the Internet of Things to a distributed ledger system might be the most effective way to solve these issues. One of the most well-known and extensively utilized distributed ledger systems is the blockchain. Due to its unique properties, such as privacy, accountability, immutability, and anonymity, blockchain technology has recently attracted a lot of interest. Using IoT in conjunction with blockchain technology can bring several benefits. This paper reviews the current state of the art different BIoT architectures, with a focus on current technologies, applications, challenges, and opportunities. The test findings prove that the decentralized authentication platform-based blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) device-to-device architecture has a significantly higher throughput than the gateway-based architecture. To encrypt the elliptical curve cryptographic (ECC) and to generate keys, the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT)-based scheme is proposed and compared with the secure hash algorithm (SHA-256). Finally, ECC-CRT is used to access system performance in terms of latency, throughput, and resource consumption, simulated through the Contiki Cooja (CC) simulator, and alter orderer and peer nodes for performance study in BIoT. A comprehensive analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is secure against a variety of known attacks, including the man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack, and outperforms the SHA-256 cryptographic algorithm. Moreover, the significance of blockchain and IoT, as well as their analysis of proposed architecture, is discussed. This paper will help readers and researchers understand the IoT and its applicability to the real world.	iot;blockchain;security;biot architecture;ecc-crt;sha-256
639	实体经济	Edge Intelligence-Based Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications for Digital Twin-Enabled Metaverse	In this letter, we propose a novel digital twin scheme supported metaverse by jointly considering the integrated model of communications, computing, and storage through the employment of mobile edge computing (MEC) and ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC). The MEC-based URLLC digital twin architecture is proposed to provide powerful computing infrastructure by exploring task offloading, and task caching techniques in nearby edge servers to reduce the latency. In addition, the proposed digital twin scheme can guarantee stringent requirements of reliability and low latency, which are highly applicable for the future networked systems of metaverse. For this first time in the literature, our paper addresses the optimal problem of the latency/reliablity in digital twins-enabled metaverse by optimizing various communication and computation variables, namely, offloading portions, edge caching policies, bandwidth allocation, transmit power, computation resources of user devices and edge servers. The proposed scheme can improve the quality-of-experience of the digital twin in terms of latency and reliability with respect to metaverse applications.	task analysis;optimization;ultra reliable low latency communication;real-time systems;industrial internet of things;digital twins;computational modeling;digital twin;metaverse;mobile edge computing;ultra-reliable and low latency communicationsshort blocklength regime;resource-allocation
640	市场治理	Deep Learning Algorithm to Predict Cryptocurrency Fluctuation Prices: Increasing Investment Awareness	Digital currencies such as Ethereum and XRP allow for all transactions to be carried out online. To emphasize the decentralized nature of fiat currency, we can refer, for example, to the fact that all virtual currency users may access services without third-party involvement. Cryptocurrency price swings are non-stationary and highly erratic, similarly to the price changes of conventional stocks. Owing to the appeal of cryptocurrencies, both investors and researchers have paid more attention to cryptocurrency price forecasts. With the rise of deep learning, cryptocurrency forecasting has gained great importance. In this study, we present a long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm that can be used to forecast the values of four types of cryptocurrencies: AMP, Ethereum, Electro-Optical System, and XRP. Mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), and normalize root mean square error (NRMSE) analyses were used to evaluate the LSTM model. The findings obtained from these models showed that the LSTM algorithm had superior performance in predicting all forms of cryptocurrencies. Thus, it can be regarded as the most effective algorithm. The LSTM model provided promising and accurate forecasts for all cryptocurrencies. The model was applied to forecast the future closing prices of cryptocurrencies over a period of 180 days. The Pearson correlation metric was applied to assess the correlation between the prediction and target values in the training and testing processes. The LSTM algorithm achieved the highest correlation values in training (R = 96.73%) and in testing (96.09%) in predicting XRP currency prices. Cryptocurrency prices could be accurately predicted using the established LSTM model, which displayed highly efficient performance. The relevance of applying these models is that they may have huge repercussions for the economy by assisting investors and traders in identifying trends in the sales and purchases of different types of cryptocurrencies. The results of the LSTM model were compared with those of existing systems. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed model showed superior accuracy based on the low prediction errors of the proposed system.	cryptocurrency;artificial intelligence;deep learning;prediction modelneural-networks;bitcoin;volatility;return

642	实体经济	Adaptive Learning Model of English Vocabulary Based on Blockchain and Deep Learning	As one of the three basic elements of language, vocabulary is particularly important when learning English. Nowadays, many students are faced with problems such as boring vocabulary teaching, forgetting quickly after reciting, inefficient vocabulary learning, and lack of initiative. Therefore, it is imperative to seek a scientific and effective teaching mode to improve students' vocabulary achievement. It builds an adaptive learning model of English vocabulary based on blockchain and deep learning, and tests the model. According to the experimental data, 46.8% of the learners will often read English newspapers or magazines to expand their English vocabulary. 50.4% of the students classified and memorized English vocabulary according to different categories. 59% of students often use context to memorize English vocabulary. The results show that before using the English vocabulary adaptive learning model based on blockchain and moderate learning, the average score of students' methods and strategies is in the middle and lower levels. After using the adaptive learning model, some students have been able to use some learning strategies, and a small number of students have expanded their vocabulary through extracurricular reading.	technology;architecture
643	实体经济	Internet of Vehicles Resource Scheduling Based on Blockchain and Game Theory	With the popularity of on-board intelligent devices, the number of vehicle computing intensive applications is also increasing rapidly. Due to the high mobility and limited computing power of the vehicle, and the extensive and changing demand for computing resources of the vehicle terminal, the vehicle often has insufficient computing power. In order to meet the needs of intensive computing applications of vehicle terminals, the computing tasks of vehicles can be unloaded to edge cloud servers (ECSs) with rich resources and high performance to enhance the computing power of vehicle terminals. However, the resource charge of ECS is high, and the scheme needs to consider such issues as ECS signal coverage, long task transmission delay caused by network congestion, and insufficient computing capacity of ECS. Therefore, this study considers unloading the computing tasks of vehicles with insufficient computing resources to nearby vehicles with redundant computing capacity and proposes a resource scheduling method for the Internet of vehicles based on blockchain and game theory. The scheduling of computing resources can reduce the computing workload of buyers' vehicles and improve the operation efficiency of the whole vehicle network.	
644	实体经济	A Long-Range Internet of Things-Based Advanced Vehicle Pollution Monitoring System with Node Authentication and Blockchain	According to United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda, the pollution detection system needs to be improved for the establishment of fresh air to obtain healthy life of living things. There are many reasons for the pollution and one of the reasons for pollution is from the emissions of the vehicles. Currently digital technologies such as the Internet of Things and Long-Range are showing significant impact on establishment of smart infrastructure for achieving the sustainability. Based on this motivation, this study implemented a sensor node and gateway-based Internet of Things architecture to monitor the air quality index value from any location through Long-Range communication, and Internet connectivity. To realize the proposed system, a customization of hardware is carried out and implemented the customized hardware i.e., sensor node and gateway in real-time. The sensor node is powered with node mapping to minimize the data redundancy. In this study, the evaluation metrics such as bit rate, receiver sensitivity, and time on air are evaluated by spreading factor (SF), code rate (CR), bandwidth, number of packets, payload size, preamble, and noise figure. The real-time sensor values are logged on the cloud server through sensor node and gateway. The sensor values recorded in the cloud server is compared with optimal values and concluded that the PM10, PM2.(5) are high in the air and remaining values of NO2, O-3, CO are optimal in the air. Along with this an architecture is proposed for interfacing the hardware with blockchain network through cloud server and API for node authentication.	cloud server;long-range;internet of things;pollutant emissions;sensors;vehicular pollutioniot;environment;emissions

It is becoming more and more difficult for companies to control their own raw material supply, production, and sales by relying only on their own strength, and this is the key to influencing a company to become bigger and stronger. This problem will be efficiently solved by the implementation of "Internet of Things + Blockchain" technology. As a result, research into a new sort of smart supply chain management based on "Internet of Things + Blockchain" is required. From the perspective of building a smart supply chain, this paper makes full use of literature data methods, theoretical analysis methods, case analysis methods, logic analysis methods, and other methods. To study the effectiveness of IoT and blockchain technology through case study of changes in the order quantity in the procurement link of the supply chain. By understanding the current status of related research at home and abroad, as well as the Internet of Things technology and blockchain technology, this paper analyzes China. The main problems existing in the supply chain management of enterprises are the combination of the Internet of Things technology and the blockchain with the enterprise supply chain to create a smart supply chain platform, and the feasibility and functional efficiency of the smart supply chain platform. The related check was found, its deficiencies were found, and remedial measures were taken. The research results show that this intelligent supply chain management platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain can make the operation of the entire supply chain clearly visible. Information and data sharing can be achieved among the various departments of the supply chain to achieve scientific management and precision of the enterprise prediction. And this model can also be used in other industries to achieve industrial upgrading.	
646	实体经济	UpHaaR: Blockchain-based charity donation scheme to handle financial irregularities	Non-profit organization raise charity donation through different sources, and raised funds often require a clean traceability. Recently, fake charity fundraisers schemes have raised a social concern, and thus a trusted and auditable approach is necessary to manage charity organizations reputations. Blockchain-based charity (BBC) schemes are proposed with decentralization that ensure trust, transparency, and chronology among donators and beneficiaries. However, the schemes suffer from the high-end complexity of certificate generation. Motivated from this, in this paper, we propose a BBC scheme, UpHaaR, where donators, defined as charity persons (CP), and beneficiaries, defined as charity beneficiaries (CB), register in blockchain, managed for diverse fundraisers by charity organizations (CO). The scheme mitigates fake fundraisers, as the charity scheme data and fund allocations to CP are managed as ledger entries in the blockchain. To maintain the security and privacy of massive CP and CB users, the scheme proposes partial key generations through certificate-less cryptography (CLC), which mitigates expensive digital signing and eliminates certificate generation through key distribution centers. For signature aspects, the scheme proposes a lightweight certificate-less signcryption scheme (CSS) that eliminates collusion against insider attacks and reduces computational costs. The scheme is evaluated for security analysis using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool, and informal attack analysis, and cost evaluations. The proposed results indicate the scheme's viability against similar conventional approaches.	blockchain;charity donation schemes;certificate less cryptography;signcryption;smart contractsaccess-control;signcryption;internet
647	实体经济	Improvement of energy conservation using blockchain-enabled cognitive wireless networks for smart cities	In Smart Cities' applications, Multi-node cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) can boost spectrum sensing efficiency in cognitive wireless networks (CWN), although there is a non-linear interaction among number of nodes and sensing efficiency. Cooperative sensing by nodes with low computational cost is not favorable to improving sensing reliability and diminishes spectrum sensing energy efficiency, which poses obstacles to the regular operation of CWN. To enhance the evaluation and interpretation of nodes and resolves the difficulty of sensor selection in cognitive sensor networks for energy-efficient spectrum sensing. We examined reducing energy usage in smart cities while substantially boosting spectrum detecting accuracy. In optimizing energy effectiveness in spectrum sensing while minimizing complexity, we use the energy detection for spectrum sensing and describe the challenge of sensor selection. This article proposed the algorithm for choosing the sensing nodes while reducing the energy utilization and improving the sensing efficiency. All the information regarding nodes is saved in the fusion center (FC) through which blockchain encrypts the information of nodes ensuring that a node's trust value conforms to its own without any ambiguity, CWN-FC pick high-performance nodes to engage in CSS. The performance evaluation and computation results shows the comparison between various algorithms with the proposed approach which achieves 10% sensing efficiency in finding the solution for identification and triggering possibilities with the value of alpha = 1.5 and gamma = 2.5 with the varying number of nodes.	algorithm

The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) has been gaining momentum since 2015 and has revolutionized the way in which food is produced, transported, stored, perceived, and consumed worldwide, leading to the emergence of new food trends. After reviewing Industry 4.0 technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, smart sensors, robotics, blockchain, and the Internet of Things) in Part I of this work (Hassoun, Ait-Kaddour, et al. 2022. The fourth industrial revolution in the food industry-Part I: Industry 4.0 technologies. Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, 1-17.), this complimentary review will focus on emerging food trends (such as fortified and functional foods, additive manufacturing technologies, cultured meat, precision fermentation, and personalized food) and their connection with Industry 4.0 innovations. Implementation of new food trends has been associated with recent advances in Industry 4.0 technologies, enabling a range of new possibilities. The results show several positive food trends that reflect increased awareness of food chain actors of the food-related health and environmental impacts of food systems. Emergence of other food trends and higher consumer interest and engagement in the transition toward sustainable food development and innovative green strategies are expected in the future.	alternative proteins;cultured meat;consumer food behavior;3d printing;food waste;industry 4;0;personalized food;sustainabilityolder-adults;by-products;functional foods;sustainable development;consumer perception;nutritional quality;waste valorisation;cultured meat;oral comfort;future
649	实体经济	Integration of Privacy Protection and Blockchain-Based Food Safety Traceability: Potential and Challenges	Concern about food safety has become a hot topic, and numerous researchers have come up with various effective solutions. To ensure the safety of food and avoid financial loss, it is important to improve the safety of food information in addition to the quality of food. Additionally, protecting the privacy and security of food can increase food harvests from a technological perspective, reduce industrial pollution, mitigate environmental impacts, and obtain healthier and safer food. Therefore, food traceability is one of the most effective methods available. Collecting and analyzing key information on food traceability, as well as related technology needs, can improve the efficiency of the traceability chain and provide important insights for managers. Technology solutions, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Privacy Preservation (PP), and Blockchain (BC), are proposed for food monitoring, traceability, and analysis of collected data, as well as intelligent decision-making, to support the selection of the best solution. However, research on the integration of these technologies is still lacking, especially in the integration of PP with food traceability. To this end, the study provides a systematic review of the use of PP technology in food traceability and identifies the security needs at each stage of food traceability in terms of data flow and technology. Then, the work related to food safety traceability is fully discussed, particularly with regard to the benefits of PP integration. Finally, current developments in the limitations of food traceability are discussed, and some possible suggestions for the adoption of integrated technologies are made.	food safety;blockchain traceability;internet of things;artificial intelligence;privacy protectionsupply chain;artificial-intelligence;management;agriculture;internet;secure;metaanalysis;framework;contract;system

While prior systematic literature reviews (SLRs) started to consolidate the literature, an SLR that simultaneously (a) covers several core technologies of the Industry 4.0, (b) synthesizes their positive and negative implications for supply chain performance in a broad sense, and (c) accounts for the critical success factors that foster or impede these implications is still missing. We contribute to establishing a cumulative body of knowledge by conducting such an SLR. We synthesize 221 articles published on 11 Industry 4.0 technologies between 2005 and 2021. Rather than aggregate implications, our SLR presents the benefits, challenges, and critical success factors of each core technology vis-a-vis supply chain performance individually. We integrate our findings into a framework of Industry 4.0 supply chain performance and derive promising avenues for future research. Specifically, we call for more research on (a) the challenges and critical success factors of Industry 4.0 technologies; (b) hitherto underexplored core technologies of the Industry 4.0; (c) the interaction of multiple core technologies (are they complements or substitutes?); as well as for (d) further consolidation and interdisciplinary dissemination efforts.	industry 4.0;supply chain;digitization;digitalization;digital technologies;literature reviewwarehouse management-system;big data analytics;blockchain technology;digital transformation;framework;smart;logistics;sustainability;opportunities;design

If the original design models or the STL (stereolithography) files are hacked or tampered, severe consequences can be anticipated. In this paper, we propose a demonstration to use a high-throughput blockchain to store the "fingerprints" of the 3D model and verify the "fingerprints" before printing to prevent illegal tampering. Relying on the tamper-resistant features of blockchain, the security of the model and the credibility of the terminal components can be ensured.

652	实体经济	Blockchain for Electronic Vaccine Certificates: More Cons Than Pros?	Electronic vaccine certificates (EVC) for COVID-19 vaccination are likely to become widespread. Blockchain (BC) is an electronic immutable distributed ledger and is one of the more common proposed EVC platform options. However, the principles of blockchain are not widely understood by public health and medical professionals. We attempt to describe, in an accessible style, how BC works and the potential benefits and drawbacks in its use for EVCs. Our assessment is BC technology is not well suited to be used for EVCs. Overall, blockchain technology is based on two key principles: the use of cryptography, and a distributed immutable ledger in the format of blockchains. While the use of cryptography can provide ease of sharing vaccination records while maintaining privacy, EVCs require some amount of contribution from a centralized authority to confirm vaccine status; this is partly because these authorities are responsible for the distribution and often the administration of the vaccine. Having the data distributed makes the role of a centralized authority less effective. We concluded there are alternative ways to use cryptography outside of a BC that allow a centralized authority to better participate, which seems necessary for an EVC platform to be of practical use.	blockchain (bc);electronic vaccination record;electronic vaccine certificate;cryptography;covid-19;clinical informatics
653	协同技术	FedCrowd: A Federated and Privacy-Preserving Crowdsourcing Platform on Blockchain	Crowdsourcing has attracted widespread attention in recent years and developed into various applications. An indispensable service of crowdsourcing systems is task recommendation, which means tasks should be accurately recommended to the workers with aligned interests. However, existing systems rely on their separate servers to conduct recommendation services, resulting in computing resources locked inside each isolated system. Moreover, due to the wide attacking surfaces of traditional centralized servers setting, existing systems are subject to single points of failure or malicious data breaches. Therefore, failure to address these inherent limitations properly will hinder the wide adoption of crowdsourcing. In this article, we propose and implement FedCrowd, the first federated and privacy-preserving crowdsourcing platform by using blockchain technology. Our main idea is to employ the smart contract as a trusted platform for systems to release encrypted tasks, and carefully craft matching protocols to enable efficient task recommendations in the ciphertext domain. Our task-matching protocols are highly customized for the decentralized settings, where users can securely perform keyword and range-based queries over federated task indexes without sharing secret keys. We formally analyze the security strengths and complete the prototype implementation on Ethereum. Experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and usability of the FedCrowd platform.	task analysis;crowdsourcing;blockchain;smart contracts;encryption;crowdsourcing;privacy-preserving;decentralized application;searchable encryption;blockchain
654	协同技术	Two-Level Stackelberg Game for IoT Computational Resource Trading Mechanism: A Smart Contract Approach	To support the increasing computation-intensive applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing is introduced to provide mobile devices computing resources for performing low-latency tasks. Therefore, how to design an effective and secure computing resource allocation mechanism is attracting increasing attention. A lot of works have been done to design an effective computational resource market for IoT, but the problems of vulnerability and inefficiency still exist. In this article, we propose a two-level Stackelberg game-based computing resource trading mechanism for mobile IoT devices with a credit-based payment approach, which is implemented by smart contracts on blockchain. In our model, the Stackelberg game consists of two levels, i.e., leader-level and user-level. In the leader-level, the computing service provider (CSP) and its agent constitute a composite leader. The agent purchases computing resource from CSP on credit and acts as a broker among leader-level and user-level reselling these computing resources to users. In the user-level, every user experiences social externality, which means users are interdependent. The leader-level subgame makes credit payment easier by making loaning and trading become a joint credit payment. The user-level subgame makes the market more active and closer to reality by introducing social externality. Besides, smart contracts can prevent malicious behaviors such as delay payment. We also conduct equilibrium analysis and prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in our Stackelberg game-based model. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the cost of smart contracts and the performance of each entity with the proposed pricing mechanism.	contracts;computational modeling;resource management;games;internet of things;computing resource trading;edge-cloud computing;stackelberg game;social externality;smart contract;mobile blockchaininternet;security;things
655	平台项目	Generous or Selfish? Weighing Transaction Forwarding Against Malicious Attacks in Payment Channel Networks	Scalability has long been a major challenge of cryptocurrency systems, which is mainly caused by the delay in reaching consensus when processing transactions on-chain. As an effective mitigation approach, the payment channel networks (PCNs) enable private channels among blockchain nodes to process transactions off-chain, relieving long-time waiting for the online transaction confirmation. The state-of-the-art studies of PCN focus on improving the efficiency and availability via optimizing routing, scheduling, and initial deposits, as well as preventing the system from security and privacy attacks. However, the behavioral decision dynamics of blockchain nodes under potential malicious attacks is largely neglected. To fill this gap, we employ the game theory to study the characteristics of channel interactions from both the micro and macro perspectives under the situation of channel depletion attacks. Our study is progressive, as we conduct the game-theoretic analysis of node behavioral characteristics from individuals to the whole population of PCN. Our analysis is complementary, since we utilize not only the classic game theory with the complete rationality assumption, but also the evolutionary game theory considering the limited rationality of players to portray the evolution of PCN. The results of numerous simulation experiments verify the effectiveness of our analysis.	blockchain;payment channel network;game theorystrategies;game
656	市场治理	Forecasting cryptocurrency volatility	This paper studies the behavior of cryptocurrencies' financial time series, of which Bitcoin is the most prominent example. The dynamics of these series are quite complex, displaying extreme observations, asymmetries, and several nonlinear characteristics that are difficult to model and forecast. We develop a new dynamic model that is able to account for long memory and asymmetries in the volatility process, as well as for the presence of time-varying skewness and kurtosis. The empirical application, carried out on 606 cryptocurrencies, indicates that a robust filter for the volatility of cryptocurrencies is strongly required. Forecasting results show that the inclusion of time-varying skewness systematically improves volatility, density, and quantile predictions at different horizons.

However, the progress and promotion of Blockchain have been seriously impeded by various security issues in blockchain-based applications. Furthermore, previous research on blockchain security has been mostly technical, overlooking considerable business, organizational, and operational issues. To address this research gap from the perspective of information systems, we review blockchain security research in three levels, namely, the process level, the data level, and the infrastructure level, which we refer to as the PDI model of blockchain security. In this survey, we examine the state of blockchain security in the literature. Based on the insights obtained from this initial analysis, we then suggest future directions of research in blockchain security, shedding light on urgent business and industrial concerns in related computing disciplines.	security;blockchain;smart contracts;business;computer architecture;organizations;encryption;blockchain security;process security;data security;consensus algorithm;smart contractsmart contract;cloud;internet;information;challenges;signature;system;technology;management;framework
658	实体经济	Increasing Cyber Defense in the Music Education Sector Using Blockchain Zero-Knowledge Proof Identification	Music creation and its promotion are encouraged both in music education and through activities organized in the context of artistic creation as part of the education in question. Although copyright registration is the primary way authors protect their rights, this is not feasible in most cases, as the processes take a long time to complete and incur high costs. We utilize modern innovative technologies and their developments in copyright protection matters to increase security and trust in music education. In particular, an advanced model of ensuring the methods and innovation produced in music education processes is proposed, using blockchain technology and smart contracts. But given that, even in an advanced system like the proposed one, authentication evidence can be easily intercepted, this work proposes a single and robust identification scheme based on an innovative zero-knowledge proof (ZNP) system, which allows one side of communication to convince the other of its validity.	privacy
659	核心技术	Design of a Blockchain-Based Traceability System with a Privacy-Preserving Scheme of Zero-Knowledge Proof	With the fast development of the industrial Internet, its interconnectivity poses new challenges for the cooperation of industrial entities. Cooperation among these entities is built on trust, and trust is based on high-quality industrial products at reasonable prices. A traceability system can play an essential role in objectively reflecting the production process and promoting this trust. However, traditional traceability systems often have data privacy issues. Because traceability data are collected or generated during the production process (namely, production-related data), they could be considered privacy data. Several researchers have introduced privacy protection schemes into the traceability system, such as authentication or encryption. Nevertheless, when a privacy protection scheme is established, the original data are disclosed to the legal user of the system, but the data may still be leaked intentionally or unintentionally. Except for data privacy issues, a traditional traceability system can be vulnerable to network attacks, data unavailability, and reliability issues. The authors conducted a study to overcome these shortcomings, and this paper reports the results. We built a traceability prototype system using a blockchain protocol and a zero-knowledge proof method. First, we built a blockchain to record key production process data, aiming to maintain data reliability and availability. Second, through an analysis of traceability purpose using production knowledge, the traceability purpose could be divided into multiple provable statements. By introducing privacy protection through a zero-knowledge proof, the traceability process was converted to proving relative statements. Finally, the statements were validated by a smart contract that provided openness and reliability during the traceability process. Analysis has shown that our approach could meet the requirements for high security and privacy. In addition, the paper also discusses the calculation cost of the traceability process to show our work's viability. The traceability system described in this paper creates new possibilities for constructing a healthy and reliable trust relationship between production entities to provide further support in the development of the industrial Internet.	chain management;industry 4.0;challenges;internet
660	核心技术	Design of a Data Security Access Control Algorithm for the Electric Vehicle Internet of Vehicles Based on Blockchain Technology	The data transmission in the vehicle network is easily interfered with by the outside world, which makes the security of data access difficult to provide in order to meet the actual needs. Therefore, a data security access control algorithm for an electric vehicle network based on blockchain technology is proposed. Using the double-chain architecture of an alliance chain-private chain in a blockchain, the distributed database of data communication for vehicle networking is constructed. In the process of vehicle network communication, the long short-term memory neural network is introduced to analyze the risk of communication behavior. A generator and discriminator are used to avoid communication risk behavior and realize secure access to data. The experimental results show that the success rate of data tampering is lower than 0.09 when this design method is used to deal with external intrusion, and it has high security.	blockchain technology;generate countermeasure network;attribute matchingscheme
661	实体经济	Blockchain solutions for carbon markets are nearing maturity	Carbon markets could hasten climate change mitigation by driving investment towards efficient decarbon-ization activities, but they face problems around trust, transparency, and uptake. Blockchain offers a foundational technology upon which new carbon markets can be built which address these shortcomings. This sector is still nascent, fragmented, and clouded by technology hype, all of which obscures objective judgement of its performance and suitability. Here, we survey the current blockchain ecosystem, identifying 39 organizations that are developing blockchain solutions for carbon markets across four use cases: emissions-trading schemes, voluntary carbon markets, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). We develop and apply a technology readiness level (TRL) scale, and we find that most projects are still proofs of concept (TRL % 3); however, one system has now reached maturity (TRL 9). Addressing the common barriers that face developers could allow more blockchain solutions to mature and potentially facilitate globalized carbon markets with greater efficiency, transparency, and accessibility.	emissions;technology
662	核心技术	Energy and Cost Efficient Resource Allocation for Blockchain-Enabled NFV	Network function virtualization (NFV) is a promising technology to make 5G networks flexible and agile. NFV decreases operators' OPEX and CAPEX by decoupling the physical hardware from the functions they perform. In NFV, users' service request can be viewed as a service function chain (SFC) consisting of several virtual network functions (VNFs) which are connected through virtual links. Resource allocation in NFV is done through a centralized authority called NFV Orchestrator (NFVO). This centralized authority suffers from some drawbacks such as single point of failure and security. Blockchain (BC) technology is able to address these problems by decentralizing resource allocation. The drawbacks of NFVO in NFV architecture and the exceptional BC characteristics to address these problems motivate us to focus on NFV resource allocation to users' SFCs without the need for an NFVO. To this end, we assume there are two types of users: users who send SFC requests (SFC requesting users) and users who perform mining process (miner users). For SFC requesting users, we formulate NFV resource allocation (NFV-RA) problem as a multi-objective problem to minimize the energy consumption and utilized resource cost, simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose an Approximation-based Resource Allocation algorithm (ARA) using Majorization-Minimization approximation method to convexify NFV-RA problem. Furthermore, due to the high complexity of ARA algorithm, we propose a low complexity Hungarian-based Resource Allocation (HuRA) algorithm using Hungarian algorithm for server allocation. Through the simulation results, we show that our proposed ARA and HuRA algorithms achieve near-optimal performance with lower computational complexity. Also, ARA algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of number of active servers, energy consumption, and average latency. Moreover, the mining process is the foundation of BC technology. In wireless networks, mining is performed by resource-limited mobile users. Since the mining process requires high computational complexity, miner users cannot perform it alone. So, in this article, we assume that miner users can perform mining process with participating of other users. For mining process, the problem of minimizing the energy consumption and cost of users' processing resources is formulated as a linear programming problem that can be optimally solved in polynomial time.	delays;servers;resource management;energy consumption;smart contracts;data centers;computer architecture;network function virtualization;blockchain;virtual network function;consensus mechanism;miningjoint optimization;assignment;networks
663	核心技术	A Game for Task Offloading in Reputation-Based Consortium Blockchain Networks	This letter studies the task offloading in reputation-based consortium blockchain networks, where the tasks are transmitted to Edge Computing Servers (ECSs) due to limited resources. We propose a novel Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism in which validation nodes (including active nodes and backup nodes) are voted based on their reputation. The incentive identifies the reputation and the consensus delay as two major factors determining the reward. A three-stage Stackelberg game is developed to jointly minimize cost of the users and maximize utilities of the master node and the validation nodes. We analyze the unique Stackelberg equilibrium exists in the proposed game by the backward induction. The simulation results demonstrate that the designed incentive is feasible for trust management, and the proposed consensus has lower delay and higher decentralization compared with the traditional DPoS.	delays;blockchains;task analysis;games;energy consumption;quality of service;smart contracts;consortium blockchain;reputation;task offloading;edge computing;stackelberg gameresource-allocation;mobile
664	核心技术	PoTS: A Secure Proof of TEE-Stake for Permissionless Blockchains	Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols emerged as a promising alternative to the largely energy-wasteful proof of work mechanisms currently in place. In contrast to computing power, however, "stake" is a virtual resource that can be replicated or reused, opening the door to attack vectors that have no counterpart in a PoW setting, and are much harder to defeat. We present PoTS (Proof of TEE-Stake), a novel PoS protocol that leverages properties of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to limit the attack surface of malicious validators, and employs techniques such as forward security to guarantee protection against posterior-corruption attacks. We show that PoTS is secure against nothing at stake, grinding, and long range attacks down to realistic hardware assumptions on TEE and well-established cryptographic assumptions, and retains reasonable security even in face of compromised TEEs. We evaluate the performance of our proposal by means of implementation. Our evaluation results demonstrate that PoTS offers an excellent trade-off between security and performance.	protocols;blockchain;cryptography;peer-to-peer computing;history;hardware;prototypes;blockchain security;proof of stake;trusted execution environments
665	核心技术	A smart contract logic to reduce hoax propagation across social media	One of the main concerns of cybersecurity is the detection of hoaxes across social media. Hoaxers propagate such messages to mislead users and to promote violence. Several approaches exist in literature to address this issue. They are mainly limited to detect hoax activities by characterizing the message nature and detecting provenance of messages. However, unless hoaxes are detected, they continue to propagate across social media nodes. This work aims at reducing the dissemination of hoaxes across group of users. Relying on social graph structure, this research develops a mechanism based on smart contract logics to prevent a group to consume a fake post. To achieve this objective, we used a smart contract to exploit a trust index computed based on message characteristics and group features such as graph density, group status, group degree, group acceptability. Based on the value of trust index, the message is forwarded or blocked. Experiments realized on groups of different characteristics revealed that the proposed smart contract is even able to reactively block a fake post of the same nature than the group type. Results indicate that the proportion of targeted groups could be reduced even if their interests match with the message subject. This research is an important step forward to anti-promote hoaxes with the novelty of exploiting smart contract approach to contain their propagation. (C) 2020 The Authors.

666	实体经济	Development of Blockchain-Based Health Information Exchange Platform Using HL7 FHIR Standards: Usability Test	Health information exchange can improve health outcomes and reduce unnecessary medical expenses. An important task in health information exchange is to prove data integrity and strengthen the right to self-determination of individuals. This can be addressed using blockchain technology and dynamic consents. We aimed to develop a blockchain-based mobile platform called HealthPocket to exchange reliable health information with proven integrity through a dynamic consent system based on the HL7 FHIR standards. Through HealthPocket, subjects can selectively provide their consent to share specific medical and PGHD through proper authorization, and each response is converted into the JSON format with FHIR compatibility. We conducted a usability test to demonstrate health information exchange between primary and tertiary medical institutions. A total of 116 subjects used the HealthPocket mobile application to selectively share health information for at least one month, and conducted a questionnaire about their experience. In addition, medical staff of the institution could access the medical information shared by the participants and use it for treatment. The user surveys for patients examined the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and overall service satisfaction. The mean overall satisfaction with the health information exchange service was the highest (4.67 out of 5 points). As security, personal information protection, and interoperability are main concerns related to health information exchange, blockchain technology can provide suitable solutions. For instance, when health information is exchanged using blockchain technology, it is impossible to alter data blocks. Therefore, by using a blockchain-based platform and dynamic consent system, we ensured the integrity of medical data.	blockchains;information exchange;medical services;medical diagnostic imaging;hospitals;interoperability;usability;blockchain;dynamic consent;fast healthcare interoperability resources;health information exchange;mobile application;personal health recordpilot program;quality

668	协同技术	CAB-IoT: Continuous authentication architecture based on Blockchain for internet of things	Raising incidents of security threats among active sessions is an increasing concern in IoT environment. Continuous authentication was introducing to be superior to traditional authentication schemes by constantly verify users' identities on an ongoing basis and spot the moment at which an illicit attacker seizes control of the session. However, several challenges remain unsolved. This research aims to investigate the power of Blockchain technology to provide real-time and non-intrusive continuous authentication for the IoT environment. Accordingly, a distributed and scalable continuous authentication solution based on Blockchain technology called CAB-IoT was proposed. It enabled fog nodes layer that tackles the limitations of IoT resources by providing localized processing of heavy continuous authentication-related tasks for a group of IoT devices. Besides, CAB-IoT introduced a trust module that depends on the face recognition machine learning model to detect outliers and abnormal access. Moreover, mutual authentication between end-users and fog nodes is also designed, as well as secure communication between the authenticated nodes. The results demonstrate a lightweight continuous authentication solution that achieved the desired balance between security and performance requirements where it was observed in a real-world environment for truly performance results. Security analysis and attack analysis are also considered during the evaluation. (C) 2020 The Authors.

669	协同技术	Enabling Decentralized and Auditable Access Control for IoT through Blockchain and Smart Contracts	The increase in the interconnection of physical devices and the emergence of the 5G paradigm foster the generation and distribution of massive amounts of data. The complexity associated with the management of these data requires a suitable access control approach that empowers citizens to control how their data are shared, so potential privacy issues can be mitigated. While well-known access control models are widely used in web and cloud scenarios, the IoT ecosystem needs to address the requirements of lightness, decentralization, and scalability to control the access to data generated by a huge number of heterogeneous devices. This work proposes CapBlock, a design that integrates a capability-based access control model and blockchain technology for a fully distributed evaluation of authorization policies and generation of access credentials using smart contracts. CapBlock is intended to manage the access to information in federated IoT environments where data need to be managed through access control policies defined by different data providers. The feasibility of CapBlock has been successfully evaluated in the scope of the EU research project IoTCrawler, which aims at building a secure search engine for IoT data in large-scale scenarios.	internet;framework;privacy;things
670	市场治理	Are Fan Tokens Fan Tokens?	Fan tokens, digital assets providing privileges including rewards and promotions as well as voting rights in polls, recently became highly popular among the football clubs and the (fan) investors. Fan tokens differ from the stocks of football clubs with respect to ownership properties. Fan tokens might be associated with investor mood changes and reaction to match results. This paper aims to explore the impact of football match results on token prices of the clubs. We show that both the losses and wins in the most prestigious European tournament, UEFA Champions League affect the fan token abnormal returns, losses with an effect of a larger magnitude. Domestic matches and Europa League matches are not followed by similar reactions from the investors. Our results are robust to the use of alternative model specifications and various benchmark assets.	fan tokens;cryptocurrencies;football clubs;asset prices;moodmarket-efficiency;sports sentiment

Using high-frequency data from December 2, 2014 to June 10, 2018, we analyze spillovers in jumps and realized second, third, and fourth moments among crude oil, gold, and Bitcoin markets via Granger causality and generalized impulse response analyses. Results suggest evidence of predictability and emphasize, among others, the need of jointly modeling linkages across those three markets with higher-order moments; otherwise, inaccurate risk assessment and investment inferences may arise. The responses of realized volatility shocks are generally positive. Further analyses indicate evidence of a weaker relationship between gold and crude oil and Bitcoin and crude oil compared to the relationship between Bitcoin and gold.

673	市场治理	What's holding back blockchain finance? On the possibility of decentralized autonomous finance	Despite the past decade's rapid innovation in adapting blockchain technology to new uses, financial intermediation remains elusive except in basic and highly collateralized forms. We introduce the concept of the technical frontier to delimit the kinds of interactions that can feasibly be structured algorithmically among pseudonymous agents, as on a blockchain, and show that lending and financial intermediation unlike monetary exchange - lie outside it, even in simple forms. The path forward for truly blockchain-native financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection. We discuss several potential technologies for doing so, and conclude that such integration is possible without compromising pseudonymity, provided real-world identity is available in the breach.

It appears that any symmetric model fails to explain the correlation structure in major cryptocurrency returns. Moreover, the sample downward tail correlations between cryptocurrencies and the equity market are much greater than the upward tail ones.

We observe that cryptocurrency policy uncertainty is the main transmitter of the return spillovers to other variables. In addition, Gold is a net receiver of both the return and the volatility spillovers. These results are valid under bearish, bullish, and normal market conditions.

We employ GARCH, EGARCH and Fixed Effects models for the daily sample of the top five stablecoins and the top five traditional cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization from December 2018 to December 2019. Our results show that a higher federal funds rate and Chinese interbank rate compress the prices and price volatility of stablecoins. In contrast, higher rates from both countries increase the prices and price volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies. Both rates also increase the trading value of both types of coins. The federal funds rate tends to have stronger impacts compared to the Chinese interbank rate on both types of coins, except for the price response of traditional cryptocurrencies.	stablecoins;cryptocurrencies;federal funds rate;chinese interbank ratebitcoin;dollar;gold

Besides, we examine whether futures trading activity, proxied by unexpected trading volume and open interest, is associated with Bitcoin volatility. We document that Bitcoin's normal and jump volatility covary positively with unexpected trading volume in the short and mid run. Meanwhile, both volatility covary positively (negatively) with unexpected open interest in the short (mid) run.	bitcoin;bitcoin futures;futures trading activity;jump risk;garch-jump modelsprice;dynamics

679	实体经济	Analysis of Agricultural Product Information Traceability and Customer Preference Based on Blockchain	For traditional agricultural product traceability system, there are some problems, such as information asymmetry and serious centralized storage. To solve the problems, a set of an agricultural product traceability information analysis system based on blockchain is designed. The overall framework of the agricultural product information traceability system is built, and the traceability model and process are designed in detail from the data layer, consensus layer, and contract layer. Collaborative verification function modules are added in the data layer to ensure the authenticity of data on the blockchain. The integral penalty mechanism is introduced to improve the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT), which ensures the security of the block network and the validity of data. Smart contracts are adopted to ensure that changes in agricultural information are actually recorded on blockchain. The results show that the designed blockchain-based agricultural product information traceability system solves the problem of difficult sharing and traceability of agricultural product information, which realizes the traceability of agricultural product production information, processing information, transportation information, and transaction query information, and has certain theoretical and practical value for the information traceability of agricultural products and other products.	internet
680	实体经济	A Blockchain-based Land Title Management System for Bangladesh	Bangladesh is a small country with a large population. Its increasingly developing economy further makes land a lucrative source of fixed capital. On the other hand, land titling is a cumbersome and lengthy process, where different government bodies process different sets of documents, and bureaucratic loopholes encourage fraudulent activities by organized people. As a result, the current model suffers from good governance. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based solution that offers data synchronization and transparency, ease of access, immutable records management, a faster and cheaper solution. Considering the technological knowledge and capacity of the people and the government, we introduced a phase by phase Blockchain adoption model that starts with a public Blockchain ledger and later gradually incorporates two levels of Hybrid Blockchain. We provide detailed smart contracts design of the public Blockchain and implement a prototype system using Ethereum. Our experimental setup uses local and live Ethereum test networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system. Our analysis shows that the proposed model reduces the number of required travels, the overall cost of information processing as well as provide easy access to vital information. As a result, Blockchain adoption can improve the land title digitization effort of Bangladesh. (C) 2020 The Authors.

681	实体经济	BCFDPS: A Blockchain-Based Click Fraud Detection and Prevention Scheme for Online Advertising	Online advertising, which depends on consumers' click, creates revenue for media sites, publishers, and advertisers. However, click fraud by criminals, i.e., the ad is clicked either by malicious machines or hiring people, threatens this advertising system. To solve the problem, many schemes are proposed which are mainly based on machine learning or statistical analysis. Although these schemes mitigate the problem of click fraud, several problems still exist. For example, some fraudulent clicks are still in the wild since their schemes only discover the fraudulent clicks with a probability approaching but not 100%. Also, the process of detecting a click fraud is executed by a single publisher, which makes a chance for the publisher to obtain illegal income by deceiving advertisers and media sites. Besides, the identity privacy of consumers is also exposed because the schemes deal with the plain text of consumers' real identity. Therefore, in this paper, a blockchain-based click fraud detection and prevention scheme (BCFDPS) for online advertising is proposed to deal with the above problems. Specifically, the BCFDPS mainly introduces bilinear pairing to implicitly verify whether a consumer's real digital identity is contained in a click message to significantly avoid click fraud and employs a consortium blockchain to ensure the transparency of the detection and prevention process. In our scheme, the clicks by machines or fraud ones by a human can be accurately detected and prevented by media sites, publishers, and advertisers. Furthermore, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is adopted to protect the identity privacy of consumers. The implementation and evaluation results show that compared with the existing click fraud detection and prevention schemes based on machine learning and statistical analysis, BCFDPS achieves detection of each fraudulent click with a probability of 100% and consumes lower computation cost; furthermore, BCFDPS adds functions of consumers' privacy protection and click fraud detection and prevention, compared to the existing blockchain-based online advertising scheme, by introducing limited communication cost (4,984 bytes) at lower storage cost.	identity

Furthermore, they are centralized and subject to a single point of control and failure. In this context, we propose a consortium blockchain-based solution to establish and improve social security informatization to meet the above challenges. In this article, we present specific business situations for three important social security services. Namely, apply for social insurance, apply for social assistance and social benefits online. Our proposed solution also provides a multi-party trust and data sharing mechanism, and also demonstrates the integration of blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) storage systems to facilitate the security of approval documents, photos and videos related to the processing of social security services Accessibility and traceability. It also introduces the implementation and testing details of the algorithm in the smart contract, and expounds how to apply it in the automatic approval of social security business to reduce the workload of existing manual review. Finally, by comparing with the existing system, it is discussed that our solution has great advantages in promoting the online processing of social security business, and the safe access and traceability of approval documents, photos and videos.	security;blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;licenses;business;insurance;springs;alliance blockchain;social security services;smart contracts;ipfsinternet
684	实体经济	Edge Blockchain Construction Efficiency Maximization for COVID-19 Detection in a Body Area Network	Detecting traces of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a prerequisite for avoiding the virus's rapid spread. However, too much patient privacy data uploaded to the cloud centre will overwhelm the network and cause user information security not to be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a personal prediction method for COVID-19 infections by perceiving the information of worn biosensors and monitoring equipment in a body area network (BAN). Edge computing and blockchain technology are introduced to solve the problems of user privacy protection and perceptual data transmission and storage. We first construct an edge body area network (EBAN) and characterize the edge blockchain cost's maximization function by considering the bandwidth, storage space, and energy consumption constraints. Then we build a blockchain without redundant perception information and select effective transmission paths by using the edge blockchain construction efficiency maximization (EBCEM) algorithm. Finally, we use the network simulator (NS-2) to simulate the performance of the EBCEM algorithm and compare it with the excellent assignment game algorithm (AGA) in terms of the effective requester ratio (ERR), effective provider ratio (EPR), edge blockchain construction success ratio (EBCSR), and average storage usage ratio (ASUR) in the EBAN.	covid-19;blockchains;edge computing;image edge detection;body area networks;bandwidth;servers;body area network;edge blockchain construction efficiency maximization algorithm;edge blockchain cost;edge computing;novel coronavirus pneumonia (covid-19)wireless;internet
685	实体经济	Blockchain and AI-Empowered Healthcare Insurance Fraud Detection: an Analysis, Architecture, and Future Prospects	Nowadays, health insurance has become an essential part of people's lives as the number of health issues increases. Healthcare emergencies can be troublesome for people who can't afford huge expenses. Health insurance helps people cover healthcare services expenses in case of a medical emergency and provides financial backup against indebtedness risk. Health insurance and its several benefits can face many security, privacy, and fraud issues. For the past few years, fraud has been a sensitive issue in the health insurance domain as it incurs high losses for individuals, private firms, and governments. So, it is essential for national authorities and private firms to develop systems to detect fraudulent cases and payments.

Cryptocurrency works similar to standard currency, however, virtual payments are made for goods and services without the intervention of any central authority. Although cryptocurrency ensures legitimate and unique transactions by utilizing cryptographic methods, this industry is still in its inception and serious concerns have been raised about its use. Analysis of the sentiments about cryptocurrency is highly desirable to provide a holistic view of peoples' perceptions. In this regard, this study performs both sentiment analysis and emotion detection using the tweets related to the cryptocurrency which are widely used for predicting the market prices of cryptocurrency. For increasing the efficacy of the analysis, a deep learning ensemble model LSTM-GRU is proposed that combines two recurrent neural networks applications including long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). LSTM and GRU are stacked where the GRU is trained on the features extracted by LSTM. Utilizing term frequency-inverse document frequency, word2vec, and bag of words (BoW) features, several machine learning and deep learning approaches and a proposed ensemble model are investigated. Furthermore, TextBlob and Text2Emotion are studied for emotion analysis with the selected models. Comparatively, a larger number of people feel happy with the use of cryptocurrency, followed by fear and surprise emotions. Results suggest that the performance of machine learning models is comparatively better when BoW features are used. The proposed LSTM-GRU ensemble shows an accuracy of 0.99 for sentiment analysis, and 0.92 for emotion prediction and outperforms both machine learning and state-of-the-art models.	cryptocurrency;sentiment analysis;text2emotion;emotion analysis;machine learningsocial networks;machine
687	技术治理	Get off of Chain: Unveiling Dark Web Using Multilayer Bitcoin Address Clustering	Bitcoin is the most widely used cryptocurrency for illegal trade in current darknet markets. Owing to the anonymity of its addresses, even though transaction flows are globally visible, Bitcoin clustering remains one of the most challenging and open problems in illegal Bitcoin transaction analysis. In this article, to resolve this problem, we propose a novel multi-layer heuristic algorithm for Bitcoin clustering, which leverages on-chain transactions as well as off-chain application data in the real world. For this purpose, we first explored the unique characteristics of darknet market ecosystems including their trading systems. By conducting an in-depth analysis of the data manually collected for 11 months, we found that some darknet market review data disclosed transactions containing Bitcoin value and item delivery information. We then identified unique Bitcoin addresses associated with the disclosed information, owned by the same darknet providers. Based on address ownership, more accurate market clusters could be created, which have not previously been identified by other clustering algorithms. According to our experimental results, approximately 31.68% of the darknet market review data matched real Bitcoin transactions, and 122 hidden clusters associated with Silk Road 4 were found. This indicates that the proposed algorithm can complement existing clustering methods and significantly reduce the false negative rate by up to 91.7%.	bitcoin;clustering algorithms;roads;heuristic algorithms;blockchains;approximation algorithms;public key;address clustering;bitcoin;blockchain;de-anonymizationsilk road

691	实体经济	Leveraging Blockchain for Scaffolding Work Management in Construction	As a temporary facility, scaffolding has an essential role in providing a work environment at height in the construction industry. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), approximately 65% of laborers work on scaffolding. Scaffolding work information needs to be effectively managed with reliability to provide a safe environment. However, managing information of the scaffolding work process remains challenging in forgery risk and manual verification. Blockchain has been widely introduced as an accountable and efficient information management solution. This study presents a blockchain-based system for scaffolding work to grant reliability and efficiency of information management. The system is developed to secure applicability by considering three aspects: (1) optimal blockchain platform regarding characteristics of scaffolding work; (2) storage method to address the hindrance of blockchain; (3) information needed to be compared for verifying adequacy. The detailed configuration and process model for the system is categorically presented, and validated via a case study. The case study confirmed that the system was able to store the information in the block smoothly, verify the information using the smart contract successfully, and remain the block size constant by using off-chain. The proposed system has the potential of practical applicability and could contribute to mitigate potential safety risks associated with inadequate scaffolding work management. Furthermore, the proposed system development flow can be leveraged as a guideline to extend blockchain applications to diverse areas in the construction domain.	blockchains;reliability;smart contracts;safety;procurement;information management;supply chains;blockchain application;construction safety;hybrid on-chain and off-chain system;scaffolding work;smart contractsystems
692	核心技术	Compact Message Permutation for a Fully Pipelined BLAKE-256/512 Accelerator	Developing a low-cost and high-performance BLAKE accelerator has recently become an attractive research trend because the BLAKE algorithm is important in widespread applications, such as cryptocurrencies, data security, and digital signatures. Unfortunately, the existing BLAKE circuits are limited in performance and hardware efficiency. Therefore, this paper introduces the first fully pipelined BLAKE-256/512 accelerator to improve throughput and hardware efficiency. Moreover, based on the rates of changed words in consecutive message inputs, a compact message permutation scheme is proposed to reduce the area and energy consumption of the fully pipelined BLAKE-256/512 accelerator. To achieve these goals, the compact message permutation scheme includes two novel optimization techniques: register optimization, reducing the number of registers used by over 80% compared to conventional message permutation in a theoretical evaluation, and XOR optimization, decreasing the number of XOR gates by 93.8%. An ASIC-based experiment shows that the proposed compact message permutation scheme helps reduce the area and power consumption by up to 11.35% and 21.10%, respectively, for the fully pipelined BLAKE-256 accelerator and by up to 9.86% and 20.32%, respectively, for the fully pipelined BLAKE-512 accelerator. The correctness of the compact message permutation scheme is verified on a real hardware platform (an Alveo U280 FPGA).	hardware;blockchains;computer architecture;throughput;optimization;field programmable gate arrays;power demand;blockchain mining;fpga;gpu;blake;fully pipelinedblake;implementation;design
693	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Distributed Renewable Energy Management Framework	Most of the world's countries are concerned with reducing harmful gas emissions. Some governments have made considerable attempts to address this problem. Saudi Arabia, for example, has taken significant steps to utilize renewable energy (RE) sources in addition to oil and gas. Consumers are encouraged to build small RE systems. These small grids will help people meet their daily electrical energy requirements. They can sell the excess to other customers. One of the major issues is managing the distribution and sale of RE. Blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) networks can help overcome several obstacles to the implementation of a distributed RE management system (DREMS). However, several impediments may still stand in the way of its execution. Scalability and productivity are two of the most important considerations. The number of transactions made to the Blockchain network will increase in lockstep with the number of energy consumers. This will result in a significant lag in response. Understanding the renewable distributed energy system will aid in minimizing the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, this research identifies the RE systems installation approaches, and how Blockchain technology can be utilized. It provides the solution requirements of any DREMS. Moreover, it proposes a new Blockchain-based framework for DREMS. And designs selective protocols of the proposed framework. It provides a comparative analysis to assess the proposed protocols' ability to meet the identified requirements.	renewable energy sources;blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;smart contracts;costs;scalability;microgrids;blockchain;distributed management;microgrid;renewable energytechnology;sector
694	核心技术	A Systematic Literature Review Toward a Blockchain Benchmarking Framework	Blockchain is a disruptive technology that focuses on the safe exchange of data between several distributed applications. Despite its widespread adoption, there are areas that require further research towards the understanding of their performance characteristics. In addition, consensus algorithms, a vital part of blockchain, require a more comprehensive understanding of their technical principles and characteristics. Along with the design of different types of consensus algorithms, several challenges, such as system scalability and power consumption, have been raised. Therefore, more comprehensive research is needed to investigate the degree to which consensus algorithms are built and how they perform. To this end, this study extends the body of knowledge and contributes towards the assessment of blockchain protocol performance. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of selected studies on blockchain performance, identifying similarities and differences while attempting to identify existing work on simulators and benchmarking frameworks that aim to explore the performance of blockchain-enabled consensus algorithms.	blockchains;bibliographies;systematics;protocols;consensus algorithm;libraries;planning;blockchain;distributed ledgers;consensus;blockchain performanceconsensus mechanisms
695	实体经济	Proof of Delivery Smart Contract for Performance Measurements	The growth of the enterprise blockchain research supporting supply chain management calls for investigations of their impact and mindfulness of their design, use cases, and pilots. With a blockchain design for the Proof of Delivery (PoD) process management, this paper contributes to learning about performance measurement and the transaction costs implications during the development and application of smart contracts. An experimental design science approach is applied to develop an open-source blockchain to explore ways to make the delivery processes more efficient, the proof of delivery more reliable, and the performance measurements more accurate. The theory of Transaction Costs is applied to evaluate the cost implications of the adoption of smart contracts in the management of the PoD. The findings show that smart contracts make the delivery processes more efficient and proof of delivery more reliable. Yet, the methods and metrics are too complex and qualitative, limiting the smart contract's capability to measure performance. Our findings indicate potential transaction costs reduction by implementing a blockchain-based performance measurement. The complexities of the delivery process and proof of delivery call for pre-contractual steps to identify the processes and performance metrics to design blockchains. Smart contracts need further development and digital aids to handle qualitative inspections and proof of delivery generation during the delivery process. The blockchain requires the system's capacity to record off-chain transactions, such as in case of disputes resolutions. The authors extended blockchain research beyond the theoretical level, designing an open-source blockchain for supply chain management within the use case, pilot design, and case study.	costs;blockchains;smart contracts;supply chains;measurement;distributed ledger;supply chain management;actual time of arrival;blockchain;delivery performance;delivery process;estimated time of arrival;ethereum;smart contract;proof of delivery;transaction costs theorysupply chain;design science;blockchain;technologies;simulation;challenges;framework;impact;model
696	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Traceability for the Fishery Supply Chain	Efficient traceability management is necessary for managing products in the fishery supply chain. Any negligence in products' traceability can result in food fraud that may adversely affect the consumer's health. Monitoring and tracking of the fishery supply chain operations can assist system stakeholders in identifying the origins and causes of product fraud and malpractice. Most of the existing systems and technologies used to manage the fishery supply chain processes fall short of providing traceability, accountability, transparency, reliability, trust, privacy, and security features. In this paper, we propose a private Ethereum blockchain-based solution to efficiently manage the fishery supply chain operations in a manner that is decentralized, transparent, traceable, secure, private, and trustworthy. We present the solution architecture and propose five smart contracts to automate the processes in fishery supply chain. We present ten algorithms along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We conduct a security analysis to show that the proposed solution is both secure and trustworthy. We compare our solution with the existing blockchain and non-blockchain-based solutions to show its effectiveness and novelty.

697	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based Solution for Mitigating Overproduction and Underconsumption of Medical Supplies	Billions of dollars lost has been recorded over the past decade due to the overproduction and underconsumption of medical supplies. The overproducation and underconsumption are usually due to the lack of accountability, transparency, traceability, audit, assessment, security, and trust features in the current healthcare supply chain systems. It is required to ensure that everyone is getting a fair share of medical supplies without unnecessary waste. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that ensures the commitment and accountability of all participants to prevent them from producing any unnecessary waste. We introduce five phases, such as registration, commitment, production, delivery, and consumption, to perform the waste assessment accurately and fairly. We develop four smart contracts that ensure data provenance, transparency, security, and accountability while recording all actions on an immutable ledger automatically. We utilize offchain decentralized storage to deal with the large data problem. We present five algorithms and discuss each phase of the proposed solution, along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We conduct the security analysis to ensure that our smart contracts are secure enough and they do not have vulnerabilities and flaws.

698	实体经济	Analysis of Blockchain Solutions for E-Voting: A Systematic Literature Review	To this day, abstention rates continue to rise, largely due to the need to travel to vote. This is why remote e-voting will increase the turnout by allowing everyone to vote without the need to travel. It will also minimize the risks and obtain results in a faster way compared to a traditional vote with paper ballots. In fact, given the high stakes of an election, a remote e-voting solution must meet the highest standards of security, reliability, and transparency to gain the trust of citizens. In literature, several remote e-voting solutions based on blockchain technology have been proposed. Indeed, the blockchain technology is proposed today as a new technical infrastructure for several types of IT applications because it allows to remove the TTP and decentralize transactions while offering a transparent and fully protected data storage. In addition, it allows to implement in its environment the smart-contracts technology which is used to automate and execute agreements between users.

699	实体经济	Blockchain for Industry 5.0: Vision, Opportunities, Key Enablers, and Future Directions	Industry 4.0 have witnessed a paradigm shift from cyber-physical systems (CPS) that aims at massive automation, to a more customer-driven approach. The shift has been attributed to the design of hyper-cognitive systems, integration of virtual and extended reality, digital machinery prototyping and twin designs, trusted machine boundaries, collaborative robots, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based supply chains. This new wave, termed Industry 5.0, is expected to leverage massive production with user-centric customization outside the scope of Industry 4.0 ecosystems. Industry 5.0 is expected to assist diverse industrial verticals like healthcare, smart farming, drones, smart grids, and supply chain production ecosystems. However, data is shared among multiple heterogeneous networks, spanning different authoritative domains. Thus, trusted and secured data transfer is crucial to synergize and secure the industrial perimeters. Blockchain (BC) is a preferred choice as a security enabler to Industry 5.0 ecosystems owing to its inherent property of immutability, chronology, and auditability in industrial systems. Limited works are proposed that present the vision and holistic view of BC-assisted Industry 5.0 applications. The article presents a first-of-its-kind survey on BC as a security enabler in Industry 5.0. Based on a descriptive survey methodology and research questions, we presented the key drivers, and potential applications, and propose an architectural vision of BC-based Industry 5.0 in diverse applicative verticals. The survey intends to present solutions that would assist industry practitioners, academicians, and researchers to drive novel BC-assisted solutions in Industry 5.0 verticals.	industries;production;fourth industrial revolution;security;service robots;artificial intelligence;blockchains;blockchain;industry 5;0;internet-of-things;security;privacysupply chain;challenges;security;internet;privacy;personalization;architecture;technology;taxonomy;network
700	实体经济	A blockchain-based certifiable anonymous E-taxing protocol	The security of the tax system is directly related to the development of a country. The conventional process of tax payment laborious steps, so this process becomes a cause of irregularities among taxpayers and tax authorities, increasing the rate of corruption in tax collection. Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, its unique advantages and promising applications in taxation offer an effective solution to the problems of electronic taxation. However, the transparency of blockchain exists the risk of privacy disclosure, the high degree of anonymity brings the problem of lack of user supervision. Therefore, for balancing the contradiction of taxpayer privacy and supervision, we propose a blockchain-based self-certified and anonymous e-taxing scheme, which uses blockchain as the underlying support, and utilizes cryptography technology such as self-certified public key, Diffie-Hellman, to reduce the taxpayer's reliance on the certificate authority, and protects the taxpayer's anonymity while realizing the tracking of the real identity of malicious taxpayers. The security analysis proves that the scheme has the properties such as anonymity, conditional privacy and unforgeability, etc. Finally, performance analysis shows that compared with similar schemes, the scheme significantly improves the registration efficiency, proving its practicability and implementability.	privacy;system
701	平台项目	Impact of Block Data Components on the Performance of Blockchain-Based VANET Implemented on Hyperledger Fabric	Blockchain, a vital technology in today's era, changed the way we share, manage and exchange our data in a centralized way to decentralized architecture. With the increasing demand for Blockchain, various platforms are available to implement public, private, consortium, or permissioned, permissionless Blockchain. Hyperledger, an open-source, permissioned, distributed ledger-based Blockchain, was hosted by Linux. This paper explores Hyperledger Fabric Private Blockchain Network (HFPBN). The architecture of HFPBN with its components and transaction flow is explored in detail. The Blockchain in HFPBN comprises multiple blocks that are linked to each other. The block elements are discussed in detail with their type and size, and after that, the total size of the block depending upon various parameters is calculated. Further, one application of Blockchain, i.e., Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), is discussed in this paper as a case study. The VANET application is implemented on the Hyperledger Fabric platform. Formulas showing the dependency of various parameters like endorsement policy, number of transactions, and number of reads and writes on block size are derived and shown in their relationship through the graph for the VANET system. The impact of block size on various performance parameters like throughput, latency, memory, and CPU utilization for the VANET system is then analyzed using Hyperledger Caliper. An optimal required value of throughput and latency is achieved for Blockchain-based VANET. Also, the Hyperledger Fabric platform seems suitable for many applications as it creates separate Blockchain for different applications.	blockchains;vehicular ad hoc networks;distributed ledger;fabrics;peer-to-peer computing;smart contracts;throughput;blockchain;hyperledger caliper;hyperledger fabric;vanetauthentication

In this paper, we discuss how blockchain technology can help in several aspects of COVID-19 vaccination scheme. We present a system in which blockchain technology is used to guaranty data integrity and immutability of beneficiary registration for vaccination, avoiding identity thefts and impersonations. Smart contracts are defined to monitor and track the proper vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by vaccine producers enabling the awareness of all network peers. For vaccine administration, a transparent and tamper-proof solution for side effects self-reporting is provided considering beneficiary and administrated vaccine association. A prototype was implemented using the Ethereum test network, Ropsten, considering the COVID-19 vaccine distribution conditions. The results obtained for each on-chain operation can be checked and validated on the Etherscan. In terms of throughput and scalability, the proposed blockchain system shows promising results while the estimated cost in terms of gas for vaccination scenario based on real data remains within reasonable limits.	vaccines;blockchain;covid-19;pandemics;immune system;smart contracts;supply chains;blockchain;covid-19;immunization programs;data integrity and immutability;smart contracts;vaccine distribution;transparency and auditchallenges
705	虚拟经济	REPUTABLE-A Decentralized Reputation System for Blockchain-Based Ecosystems	Reputation systems are an important means to facilitate trustworthy interactions between on-and off-chain services and users. However, contemporary reputation systems are typically dependent on a trusted central authority to preserve privacy of raters or on adding noise into the user feedback. Moreover, the accuracy of reputation values relies on the integrity of user feedback or input; this feedback should not be tampered with or misused for other purposes. This paper presents blockchain-based reputation system named REPUTABLE (A Decentralized Reputation System for blockchain-based Ecosystems), which computes the reputation of service providers and external services within a blockchain ecosystem through decentralized on-chain and off-chain implementation. Specifically, REPUTABLE not only ensures privacy, but also reliability, integrity and accuracy of reputation values, while incurring minimal overhead. It also enables performing certain data or statistical analytics functions on user feedback, whilst preserving security, privacy, accountability and unlinkability of participants and their feedback. We present a proof-of-concept implementation and a demonstration of the REPUTABLE system. Finally, by means of formal and empirical evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our proposed system to preserve the anonymity of user feedback and the high performance of its blockchain-based implementation.	blockchains;privacy;ecosystems;data privacy;reliability;peer-to-peer computing;reputation;privacy;unlinkability;blockchain;trustprivacy
706	协同技术	Toward Software-Defined Networking-Based IoT Frameworks: A Systematic Literature Review, Taxonomy, Open Challenges and Prospects	Internet of Things (IoT) is characterized as one of the leading actors for the next evolutionary stage in the computing world. IoT-based applications have already produced a plethora of novel services and are improving the living standard by enabling innovative and smart solutions. However, along with its rapid adoption, IoT technology also creates complex challenges regarding the management of IoT networks due to its resource limitations (computational power, energy, and security). Hence, it is urgently needed to refine the IoT-based application's architectures to robustly manage the overall IoT infrastructure. Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a paradigm that offers software-based controllers to manage hardware infrastructure and traffic flow on a network effectively. SDN architecture has the potential to provide efficient and reliable IoT network management. This research provides a comprehensive survey investigating the published studies on SDN-based frameworks to address IoT management issues in the dimensions of fault tolerance, energy management, scalability, load balancing, and security service provisioning within the IoT networks. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the research studies (published from 2010 to 2022) focusing on SDN-based IoT management frameworks. We provide an extensive discussion on various aspects of SDN-based IoT solutions and architectures. We elaborate a taxonomy of the existing SDN-based IoT frameworks and solutions by classifying them into categories such as network function virtualization, middleware, OpenFlow adaptation, and blockchain-based management. We present the research gaps by identifying and analyzing the key architectural requirements and management issues in IoT infrastructures. Finally, we highlight various challenges and a range of promising opportunities for future research to provide a roadmap for addressing the weaknesses and identifying the benefits from the potentials offered by SDN-based IoT solutions.	internet of things;blockchains;middleware;load management;computer architecture;sensors;security;internet of things (iot);software-defined networking (sdn);sdn-based iot management frameworks;systematic literature review;network function virtualization;openflow;middleware;blockchain;security management;fault tolerance;load balancing;scalability;energy managementof-the-art;ddos attack;publish/subscribe middleware;enabling technologies;comprehensive survey;scalable blockchain;energy efficiency;research issues;smart cities;internet
707	协同技术	A Secure Blockchain Platform for Supporting AI-Enabled IoT Applications at the Edge Layer	In this study, a new blockchain protocol and a novel architecture that integrate the advantages offered by edge computing, artificial intelligence (AI), IoT end-devices, and blockchain were designed, developed, and validated. This new architecture has the ability to monitor the environment, collect data, analyze it, process it using an AI-expert engine, provide predictions and actionable outcomes, and finally share it on a public blockchain platform. For the use-case implementation, the pandemic caused by the wide and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was used to test and evaluate the proposed system. Recently, various authors traced the spread of viruses in sewage water and studied how it can be used as a tracking system. Early warning notifications can allow governments and organizations to take appropriate actions at the earliest stages possible. The system was validated experimentally using 14 Raspberry Pis, and the results and analyses proved that the system is able to utilize low-cost and low-power flexible IoT hardware at the processing layer to detect COVID-19 and predict its spread using the AI engine, with an accuracy of 95%, and share the outcome over the blockchain platform. This is accomplished when the platform is secured by the honesty-based distributed proof of authority (HDPoA) and without any substantial impact on the devices' power sources, as there was only a power consumption increase of 7% when the Raspberry Pi was used for blockchain mining and 14% when used to produce an AI prediction.	blockchains;internet of things;artificial intelligence;security;computer architecture;smart contracts;edge computing;edge computing;blockchain protocol;the internet of things (iot);flexible iot hardware;artificial intelligence (ai);coronavirus disease (covid-19)internet
708	实体经济	Automated Responsible Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities	The disclosure of security vulnerabilities plays an important role in notifying vendors and the public about flaws in digital systems. Among the proposed disclosure approaches, the most utilized is Responsible Disclosure, which still suffers from several disadvantages such as fostering a false sense of security among the end-users, allowing arbitrary delays in the disclosure process, and forcing the party reporting a vulnerability to identify themselves, which has been exploited by vendors through intimidation and malpractice. To address these issues, this paper presents an improved version of the Responsible Disclosure approach called Automated Responsible Disclosure (ARD) - a solution that leverages distributed ledgers and interledger technologies to automate the disclosure process while offering increased security, privacy, and transparency. A prototype implementation has been released as open-source software, and the evaluation of the solution shows that ARD is capable of addressing the key shortcomings in existing solutions and fostering more transparent disclosure practices.	distributed ledger;privacy;computer bugs;smart contracts;public transportation;prototypes;peer-to-peer computing;responsible disclosure;automated responsible disclosure;security vulnerability;privacy;distributed ledger;interledger;smart contract;chaincodeblockchain
709	市场治理	The 2021 Bitcoin Bubbles and Crashes-Detection and Classification	In this study, the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is adopted for real-time identification and monitoring of Bitcoin bubbles and crashes using different time scale data, and the modified Lagrange regularization method is proposed to alleviate the impact of potential LPPLS model over-fitting to better estimate bubble start time and market regime change. The goal here is to determine the nature of the bubbles and crashes (i.e., whether they are endogenous due to their own price evolution or exogenous due to external market and/or policy influences). A systematic market event analysis is performed and correlated to the Bitcoin bubbles detected. Based on the daily LPPLS confidence indictor from 1 December 2019 to 24 June 2021, this analysis has disclosed that the Bitcoin boom from November 2020 to mid-January 2021 is an endogenous bubble, stemming from the self-reinforcement of cooperative herding and imitative behaviors of market players, while the price spike from mid-January 2021 to mid-April 2021 is likely an exogenous bubble driven by extrinsic events including a series of large-scale acquisitions and adoptions by well-known institutions such as Visa and Tesla. Finally, the utilities of multi-resolution LPPLS analysis in revealing both short-term changes and long-term states have also been demonstrated in this study.	bitcoin bubble;log-periodic power law singularity (lppls);lppls confidence indicator;cryptocurrency;financial bubble and crash;modified lagrange regularization method

Crypto-payment is one such application that can bring radical changes to financial transactions in many industries, particularly e-commerce and online retail. However, characteristics of the technology such as transaction disintermediation, lack of central authority, and lack of adequate regulations may introduce new privacy and security concerns among the users. This coincides with another trend of rising individuals' concerns pertaining to information privacy and security issues in online transactions. The current paper investigates how consumer trust in crypto-payment, a key determinant of consumer intentions and relational exchanges over the long-term, is formed based on their perceptions towards privacy and security aspects of the technology. Using data from 327 survey participants, the study found that perceived information privacy risk, perceived anonymity, and perceived traceability of transactions are significant determinants of consumer trust in crypto-payment; but their perceptions of information security fraud risk have no significant effect. It also provided support for the hypothesis that perceived trust contributes to consumers' intention to adopt crypto-payment. The findings highlight the need to enhance consumer understanding and awareness of information privacy and potential security issues in crypto-payment as well as what needs to be done to address consumer concerns in this regard. The paper creates novel insights into the requirements of trust in crypto-payment services and the consequences of consumers' perceptions of privacy and security in this domain.	security;privacy;bitcoin;electronic commerce;behavioral sciences;investment;industries;adoption intentions;consumer trust;crypto-payment;e-commerce;information security;partial least squares structural equation modeling (pls-sem);privacypls-sem;mobile payment;self-disclosure;bitcoin;intention;cryptocurrencies;commerce;adoption;model;technology
711	市场治理	A Survey on Technologies Which Make Bitcoin Greener or More Justified	According to recent estimates, one bitcoin transaction consumes as much energy as 1.5 million Visa transactions. Why is bitcoin using so much energy? Most of the energy is used during the bitcoin mining process, which serves at least two significant purposes: a) distributing new cryptocurrency coins to the cryptoeconomy and b) securing the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. In reality, the comparison of bitcoin transactions to Visa transactions is not that simple. The amount of transactions in the Bitcoin network is not directly connected to the amount of bitcoin mining power nor the energy consumption of those mining devices; for example, it is possible to multiply the number of bitcoin transactions per second without increasing the mining power and the energy consumption. Bitcoin is not only "digital money for hackers". It has very promising future potential as a global reserve currency and a method to make the World Wide Web (WWW) immune to cyberattacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. This survey approached cryptocurrencies' various technological and environmental issues from many different perspectives. To make various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), greener and more justified, what technological solutions do we have? We found that cryptocurrency mining might be cleaner than is generally expected. There is also a plan to make a vast renewable energy source available by combining Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Bitcoin mining. There are plans to use unconventional computing methods (quantum computing, reversible computing, ternary computing, optical computing, analog computing) to solve some of the issues regarding the vast energy consumption of conventional computing (including cryptocurrency mining). We think using spare computing cycles for grid computing efforts is justified. For example, there are billions of smartphones in the world. Many smartphones are being recharged every day. If this daily recharging period of twenty to sixty minutes would be used for grid computing, for example, finding new cures to cancer, it would probably be a significant breakthrough for medical research simulations. We call cryptocurrency communities to research and develop grid computing and unconventional computing methods for the most significant cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).	bitcoin;blockchains;green products;energy consumption;air pollution;peer-to-peer computing;grid computing;blockchain;dlt;cryptocurrency;bitcoin;green technology;sustainability;unconventional computing;climate changecarbon footprint;ternary logic;energy;design;prospects

The blockchain as a sociotechnical system	Blockchain is emerging as a powerful technological force that promises to change society's status quo. The UAE has taken a proactive approach to blockchain innovation and development. With the framing of blockchain as a sociotechnical system, blockchain initiatives in the UAE are critically examined in terms of prospects, challenges, and implications for future digital societies. Blockchain developmental trajectories are analysed from a sociotechnical lens, i.e., societal, technological, industrial, and economic trends that characterise the interfaces and interaction among people, organisations, technology, and society, eliciting underlying potential influences of cultural, ethical, and legal rhetoric. Despite strong initiatives, a series of challenges, such as trust, privacy, and transparency, has emerged as blockchain begins to develop its full potential. With these issues, sociotechnical concerns have increased regarding how to respond to the possible consequences that such a policy choice would entail, how to govern blockchains, and how to create a sustainable blockchain ecosystem. The socio-political ramifications of UAE blockchains are critically assessed to establish key features and conceptualise issues to unlock opportunities to guarantee a sociotechnical approach to blockchains.	blockchain;trust;sociotechnical perspective;sociotechnical blockchain;uaetechnology
714	市场治理	On fitting and forecasting the log-returns of cryptocurrency exchange rates using a new logistic model and machine learning algorithms	Cryptocurrency is a digital currency and also exists in the form of coins. It has turned out as a leading method for peer-to-peer online cash systems. Due to the importance and increasing influence of Bitcoin on business and other related sectors, it is very crucial to model or predict its behavior. Therefore, in recent, numerous researchers have attempted to understand and model the behaviors of cryptocurrency exchange rates. In the practice of actuarial and financial studies, heavy-tailed distributions play a fruitful role in modeling and describing the log returns of financial phenomena. In this paper, we propose a new family of distributions that possess heavy-tailed characteristics. Based on the proposed approach, a modified version of the logistic distribution, namely, a new modified exponential-logistic distribution is introduced. To illustrate the new modified exponential-logistic model, two financial data sets are analyzed. The first data set represents the log-returns of the Bitcoin exchange rates. Whereas, the second data set represents the log-returns of the Ethereum exchange rates. Furthermore, to forecast the high volatile behavior of the same datasets, we apply dual machine learning algorithms, namely Artificial neural network and support vector regression. The effectiveness of these models is evaluated against self exciting threshold autoregressive model.	logistic distribution;heavy -tailed distributions;x family;cryptocurrency;artificial;neural networks;support vector regression
715	实体经济	PRMS: Design and Development of Patients' E-Healthcare Records Management System for Privacy Preservation in Third Party Cloud Platforms	In the current digital era, personal data storage on public platforms is a major cause of concern with severe security and privacy ramifications. This is true especially in e-health data management since patient's health data must be managed following a slew of established standards. The Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) primarily provide computing and storage resources. However, data security in the cloud is still a major concern. In several instances, Blockchain technology rescues the CSPs by providing the robust security to the underlying data by encrypting data using the unique and secret keys. Each network user in Blockchain has its own unique and secret keys linked directly to the transaction keys as a digital signature to protect the data. However, Blockchain technology suffers from the latency and throughput issues in high workload scenarios. To overcome e-healthcare records privacy issues in a third-party cloud, we designed a Patient's E-Healthcare Records Management System (PRMS) that focuses on latency and throughput. A comprehensive performance analysis of PRMS is carried out on different third-party clouds to validate its applicability. Moreover, the proposed PRMS system is compared with Blockchain platforms such as Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 and Etherium 1.5.8 against latency and throughput by adjusting the workload for each platform up to 10,000 transactions per second. The proposed PRMS is compared to the Secure and Robust Healthcare-Based Blockchain (SRHB) approach using Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) and small bank datasets. The experimental results indicate that deploying PRMS on Amazon Web Services decreases System Execution Time (SET) and the Average Delay (AD) time by 2.4%, 8.33%, and 25.15%, 15.26%, respectively. Additionally, deploying PRMS on the Google Cloud Platform decreases System Execution Time (SET) and Average Delay (AD) by 2.27%, 2.4%, and 2.72%, 4.73% AD, respectively. The experimental results confirm the superiority of the PRMS under the high workload scenario over SRHB and its applicability in cloud data centers.	cloud computing;medical services;blockchains;security;throughput;electronic medical records;data privacy;electronic healthcare;storage management;cloud computing;e-health;privacy;information security;blockchainopportunities;blockchain;resource
716	实体经济	Secure Message Handling in Vehicular Energy Networks Using Blockchain and Artificially Intelligent IPFS	In the underlying work, the problems faced during message dissemination in the conventional Vehicular Energy Networks (VENs) like lack of security, breach of personal identities, absence of trust between vehicle owners, etc., are tackled. In this study, a Blockchain (BC) based announcement system is proposed for VENs to ensure secure and reliable announcement dissemination in the proposed network. The proposed system is a three-layered system comprising message dissemination layer, storage layer and BC layer. In the first layer, all the vehicles are registered through a Certificate Authority (CA), which ensures only the legitimate vehicles become part of the proposed network and interact with each other. Later, in the second layer, the data sent by the vehicles is stored at the artificial intelligence based Interplanetary File System (IPFS), which is incorporated with the Road Side Units (RSUs). This ensures reduction in storage cost and data availability. Besides, vehicle owners' privacy is ensured by concealing the real identities of the vehicles. Moreover, the hashes of the data stored in the IPFS are stored in BC in the third layer. Also, lightweight trustworthiness verification of the vehicles, reputation based incentivization and concealing predictable trends in vehicles' reputation scores are performed in the same layer. Overall, the novelty of the proposed work lies in the fact that the proposed system efficiently tackles different problems encountered in the existing systems simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, it is inferred that the computational time is reduced by 15-18% and the storage overhead is reduced by 80-85%, respectively when storing hash of data on the BC network as compared to storing actual data on the network.	privacy;security;memory;protocols;blockchains;authentication;artificial intelligence;blockchain;cuckoo filter;artificial intelligence based ipfs;message dissemination;privacy;vehicular energy networkauthentication;scheme;internet
717	核心技术	Redactable Blockchain From Decentralized Chameleon Hash Functions	Blockchain is a technology with decentralization and immutability features and has been employed for auditing by many applications. However, immutability sometimes limits the application of blockchain technology. For example, vulnerable smart contracts on blockchain cannot be redacted due to immutability. The existing redactable blockchain solutions either have a low efficiency or violate the decentralization feature. Moreover, those solutions lack mechanisms for tracing redaction history and checking block consistency. In this paper, we present an efficient redactable blockchain with traceability in the decentralized setting. Specifically, we propose a decentralized chameleon hash function for redactable blockchain that every redaction must be approved by multiple blockchain nodes. We also design a redactable blockchain structure that maintains all redactions of a block and encodes the redacted blocks into an RSA accumulator. Then, we propose an efficient block consistency check protocol based on the RSA accumulator. Finally, we conduct experiments and compare our scheme with another decentralized redactable blockchain to demonstrate that our solution is efficient in practice.	blockchains;hash functions;history;proposals;vegetation;public key;electronic mail;redactable blockchain;decentralization;chameleon hash
718	虚拟经济	CROWD FUNDING FRAUD PREVENTION USING BLOCKCHAIN	Crowd funding fraud prevention using blockchain - Blockchain is shared that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assests in in a network. virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on block chain network, Generally People who are interested in a project can donate by making an online transaction. The donated money goes to the project manager, which he uses to complete the project or to make a product. This existing method of online crowdfunding has a major drawback. It does not allow contributors to have control over the money they have contributed. Since in the existing method the project manager has all the control over the money contributed he can very easily perform malicious activities. Here we address this problem faced by the existing online crowdfunding platforms by using ethereum network and smart contract. The development of Block chain technology has allowed businesses to build decentralized models. It has derived new methods to conduct transactions and make agreements. One of the technologies that propose an alternative to the traditional model is the smart contract. A smart contract is similar to a contract in the physical world, but it is digital and represented by a tiny computer program stored in a block chain.	blockchain;centralised & decentralised systems;smart contractkw wind turbine;sub-assemblies;reliability;vibration

The current research is applied in terms of purpose, descriptive-exploratory in terms of data collection, and qualitative-quantitative in terms of data nature. Based on this, first, with the aim of collecting qualitative data, after reviewing the literature related to the research topic, a framework for posing questions for interviews with experts was formulated. In the following, using the judgmental purposeful sampling method, the opinions of 15 executive experts with experience in DigiKala Company and academic experts familiar with blockchain technology and financing were used until the theoretical saturation stage. The conducted interviews were coded with Clark and Brown's six-step inductive theme analysis method. Based on this, 63 cases of speech evidence identified from the text of the interviews were labeled in the form of 17 primary codes. Then, the primary codes were categorized into five sub-themes and finally, two main themes. In the following, in order to validate the results of the interviews and confirm the research components, a questionnaire and fuzzy Delphi method were used, Also, in order to theoretically validate the research model in terms of comprehensiveness, uniqueness, coherence and integrity, as well as proportionality, the questionnaire tool was used, and for its analysis, the sample t-test and SPSS software were used. Based on the results of the research in the Delphi section, all five sub-themes or questions of the Delphi questionnaire were approved by the research experts.

720	实体经济	Multi-Channel Blockchain Scheme for Internet of Vehicles	With the development of advanced information and communication technology, the traditional centralized service model alone no longer meets the increasing demand of data exchange in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). While Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has been introduced to achieve more advanced ITS, there are still some unsettled issues such as flexibility and fault tolerance. The conventional centralized approach for ITS is vulnerable to the single point of failure, and lack of flexibility due to its dependence on a trusted third party (TTP). The emergence of blockchain technology provides a potential direction to address these problems. However, due to varying vehicle densities, it is challenging to select the best blockchain parameters to satisfy the application requirements. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel blockchain scheme that can use the best parameters in accordance with the vehicle density. The proposed scheme first defines multiple blockchain channels where each channel is optimized for a certain vehicle density level. Then, the system selects the best channel according to the vehicle density, and the application requirements on the transaction throughput and latency. We use extensive simulations to show that the proposed blockchain scheme achieves a significantly better performance as compared with existing baselines.	blockchain;vehicular ad hoc networks;peer-to-peer computing;cloud computing;distributed ledger;transportation;edge computing;blockchain;iov;hyperledger fabric;channel managementcomprehensive survey;management;systems
721	实体经济	CTMF: Context-Aware Trust Management Framework for Internet of Vehicles	Secure communication is the top concern of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The trust between nodes can have a considerable impact on ensuring IoV security. Therefore, the trustworthiness of a received message must be evaluated before acting upon it. A malicious node can broadcast bogus events to obtain network control. False reports and malicious vehicles render the network unreliable during emergencies. In this study, a unique trust framework is presented that considers most of the aspects of trust in IoV to accurately identify malicious nodes and events. Previous studies have proposed some trust models for VANETs, which have many deficiencies in serving IoV. In particular, they lack dynamism and practical implementations. All the existing models have two things in common, first they work on fixed parameters, and second, they use static scenarios. In contrast, the proposed framework is based on a context-awareness cognitive approach with artificial intelligence (AI) properties. The framework cognitively learns the environment from the received report and creates a context around an event. In addition to trust management (TM), the proposed framework offers a novel process for detecting and screening malicious nodes using anomaly outliers. The performance of the framework was examined using an experimental simulation. The proposed framework was compared with top benchmarks in the field. The results show inclining performance indicators. The proposed trust-management framework has the potential to serve as a component of IoV security.	security;context modeling;data models;blockchains;vehicular ad hoc networks;trust management;computational modeling;internet of vehicles (iov);trust management (tm);vehicular ad hoc network (vanet);context awarenessmodel;security;privacy;attacks;scheme;system
722	核心技术	Embedding Tamper-Resistant, Publicly Verifiable Random Number Seeds in Permissionless Blockchain Systems	Many blockchain processes require pseudo-random numbers. This is especially true of blockchain consensus mechanisms that aim to fairly distribute the opportunity to propose new blocks between the participants in the system. The starting point for these processes is a source of randomness that participants cannot manipulate. This paper proposes two methods for embedding random number seeds in a blockchain data structure to serve as inputs to pseudo-random number generators. Because the output of a pseudo-random number generator depends deterministically on its seed, the properties of the seed are critical to the quality of the eventual pseudo-random number produced. Our protocol, B-Rand, embeds random number seeds that are confidential, tamper-resistant, unpredictable, collision-resistant, and publicly verifiable as part of every transaction. These seeds may then be used by transaction owners to participate in processes in the blockchain system that require pseudo-random numbers. Both the Single Secret and Double Secret B-Rand protocols are highly scalable with low space and computational cost, and the worst case is linear in the number of transactions per block.	blockchains;generators;consensus algorithm;bitcoin;stakeholders;protocols;peer-to-peer computing;b-rand;blockchain;consensus algorithm;homomorphic encryption;pseudo-random number generation;random number seedsproofs
723	协同技术	Fine-grained Web Service Trust Detection: A Joint Method of Machine Learning and Blockchain	Current website defacement detection methods often ignore security and credibility in the detection process. Furthermore, with the gradual development of dynamic websites, false positives and underreports of website defacement have periodically occurred. Therefore, to enhance the credibility of website defacement detection and reduce the false-positive rate and the false-negative rate of website defacement, this paper proposes a fine-grained trust detection scheme called WebTD, that combines machine learning and blockchain. WebTD consists of two parts: an analysis layer and a verification layer. The analysis layer is the key to improving the success rate of website defacement detection. This layer mainly uses the naive Bayes (NB) algorithm to decouple and segment different types of web page content, and then preprocess the segmented data to establish a complete analysis model. Second, the verification layer is the key to establishing a credible detection mechanism. WebTD develops a new blockchain model and proposes a multi-value verification algorithm to achieve a multilayer detection mechanism for the blockchain. In addition, to quickly locate and repair the defaced data of the website, the Merkle tree (MT) algorithm is used to calculate the preprocessed data. Finally, we evaluate WebTD against two state-of-the-art research schemes. The experimental results and the security analysis show that WebTD not only establishes a credible web service detection mechanism but also keeps the detection success rate above 98%, which can effectively ensure the integrity of the website.	website defacement;trusted detection;naive bayes;blockchain;merkle tree
724	核心技术	The impact of network delay on Nakamoto consensus mechanism	Nakamoto consensus is prevailing in the world largest blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Since then, various attempts have been studied to attack Nakamoto consensus worldwide. In recent years, network delay has won more attention for making inconsistent ledgers in blockchain-based applications by virtue of attacking Nakamoto consensus. However, so far as we know, most of the existing works mainly focus on constructing inconsistent ledgers for blockchain systems, but not offering fine-grained theoretical analysis for how to optimize the success probability by flexibly dividing computational power and network delay from the viewpoint of adversary. The paper first utilizes network delay and the partition of controlled computation power of honest miners for making forks as long as possible. Then, formally analysis is provided to show the success probability of the proposed attack, and compute the optimal network delay and splitting for adversarial computation power in theory. Finally, simulation experiments validate the correctness of the formal analysis.	network delay;nakamoto consensus;blockchain

Web of Science, Scopus, and a set of specific keywords were used to select peer-reviewed papers presenting evidence of the considered connections. Selected clusters and topics were used to build a reference framework formed by relations between CI and I4.0. The results revealed that despite the popularity of both issues, studies examining the mutual relations between the same are lacking. The added value of the article is that it organizes the knowledge related to relations between I4.0 and CI, and indicates the research areas that require further scrutiny.

727	虚拟经济	The Visual Significance of Money: the Value of the Immaterial	The aim of this paper is to investigate the visual significance of money in the context of dematerialization when money loses its material form and becomes invisible. In this vein, currency design helps to assess the meaning of the visual, important for exchange on the symbolic level. It is crucial to divide exactly the visual as representations implied in visual narratives of currency design, and the visible as physical features of money issued during certain historical periods. Paradoxically, while the visible embodies the abstract idea of money circulating in the material world, the visual promotes ideologized images of reality, substituting reality itself. And once money becomes immaterial, the economic value becomes a pure social convention, but the value of possessing money gains phantasmatic features grounded in digitized visual imagery like, for instance, NFT artworks, while material money transcends its economic functionality and gains the value of the cultural artifact.	currency design;dematerialization;money;value;visual
728	协同技术	On the Design of a Privacy-Preserving Communication Scheme for Cloud-Based Digital Twin Environments Using Blockchain	Digital twin technology is recently in the spotlight because of its potential applicability in business and industry. In digital twin environments, data generated from physical assets are transmitted to a remote server, which performs simulations through digital twins in a virtual space. Then, the simulation results can be shared with the data owner or other users. However, several challenges exist in the application of digital twin technology in the real world. One of the main challenges involves determining how to share real-time data for the simulation and how to share the simulation data securely. The data generated from physical assets may include sensitive information from data owners, and the leakage of data to an adversary can cause serious privacy problems. Moreover, the sharing of data with other data users should also be considered to maximize the availability of digital twin data. To resolve these issues, we propose a system model for the secure sharing of digital twin data. The proposed system model uses cloud computing for efficient data sharing and blockchain for data verifiability. We also propose communication schemes for the proposed model to guarantee privacy preservation and data security in wireless channels. We analyze the security of the proposed protocol using informal methods and formal methods such as BAN logic and the AVISPA simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare the proposed protocol with related protocols and demonstrate that the proposed scheme is applicable to digital twin environments.	digital twins;cloud computing;blockchains;servers;data models;protocols;computational modeling;digital twin;mutual authentication and key agreement;blockchain;cloud computing;ban logic;avispakey agreement protocol;authentication;secure
729	协同技术	An Architecture Combining Blockchain, Docker and Cloud Storage for Improving Digital Processes in Cloud Manufacturing	The Blockchain has been given great attention in recent literature among emerging technologies in software architectures. More specifically, when verifiable transactions between untrusted parties are concerned in a safe and reliable environment, its peculiar decentralized and tamper-proof structure makes it suitable for a vast class of business domains, such as Cloud Manufacturing, which is a new paradigm in the industry based on cloud technologies. However, the stiffness of existing solutions, that are unable to provide and implement heterogeneous services in a Cloud environment, emphasizes the need of a standard framework to overcome this limit and improve collaboration. Firstly, this paper introduces a Blockchain based platform designed with Smart Contracts for improving digital processes in a manufacturing environment. The primary contribution is the integration of two popular cloud technologies within the Blockchain: Docker, a scalable platform to run applications in lightweight environments, and Cloud Storage. Each process available in the platform requires input files and produces output files by using cloud storage as a repository and it is delivered by the owner as a self-contained Docker image, whose digest is safely stored in the chain. Secondly, with the purpose of selecting the fastest node for each new process instance required by consumers, we introduce a task assignment problem based on a deep learning approach and past metrics. The proposed platform is applied to a real-world industrial case study regarding ophthalmic lenses manufacturing and the optimization of lens surface calculation.	blockchains;cloud computing;manufacturing;smart contracts;computer architecture;business;task analysis;cloud manufacturing;blockchains;software architecture;distributed ledger;smart contracts;computer architectureindustry 4.0

The distributed health data and the decentralized health care system structure make it ideal for blockchain-based health information systems. The authors consider the referral use case; for instance, a patient goes to his primary health Centre (PHC) for treatment and is referred to a hospital. Authentication is usually done using certificates or key cryptography, which could become cumbersome when multiple parties are involved in a healthcare interaction. The security requirements were defined, and a novel multi-party, mutual patient identity authentication scheme called "Distributed Dynamic Mutual Identity Authentication (DDMIA)" was proposed for the referral use case in a blockchain-based e-health network. The DDMIA enables the PHC to authenticate the patient to the referred hospital. The DDMIA scheme was designed using Elliptic Curve Cryptography. It was proven to be secure by assuming the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete log problem (ECDLP) and Elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDH) using CK-Model. The formal security analysis using BAN logic proved that the sessions are secure after authentication. The DDMIA scheme was simulated in the AVISPA tool and proven safe against all active attacks. The scheme allows a patient to be authenticated by multiple parties without registering with all parties. It eliminates the need for multiple registration centers as well as digital certificates. Hence, the DDMIA scheme can be implemented for similar multiparty authentication requirements in blockchain-based networks.	authentication;medical services;hospitals;blockchains;security;servers;elliptic curve cryptography;blockchain;referral;e-health;health data exchange;distributed identity authentication;multi-party authenticationprotocol;scheme;security

Rather, it has influenced other industries to develop robust privacy and security solutions, such as smart houses, smart electrical grids, smart agriculture, smart health care, smart transportation, etc. These Cyber-Physical Systems heavily depend on IoT-based smart devices that constitute a networked system of devices dependent on each other for the smooth operation of the overall system. Hence, security and privacy have become integral to all the architectural frameworks they operate in. The adoption of these architectures, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), and Internet of Everything (IoE), has reinforced the need to develop solutions based on a distributed environment. Distributed ledger technology, i.e., Blockchain, has taken the lead and may support the development of robust privacy and security solutions. We provide an updated review of authentication mechanisms developed on blockchain technology that enforce decentralized architectures. We discuss the security issues regarding the authentication of these IoT-enabled smart devices. We evaluate and analyze the study of the proposed literature schemes that pose authentication challenges in terms of computational costs, communication overheads, and models applied to attain robustness. Hence, lightweight solutions for managing, maintaining, processing, and storing authentication data of IoT-enabled assets are a must. From an integration perspective, cloud computing has provided strong support. In contrast, decentralized ledger technology, i.e., Blockchain, and lightweight cryptosystems are the areas for much more to explore. Finally, we discuss the future research challenges, which present an improvement standpoint to help address the ambiguities.	smart devices;smart cities;internet of things;cloud computing;authentication;wireless sensor networks;security;ubiquitous computing;iot;authentication;iot-enabled smart device;smart city;blockchain;decentralized ledger technology;cyber-physical system;internet of things;securitythings iot;internet;network;architectures;protection;efficient

The expeditious surge in the collaborative environments, like IoT, cloud computing, and SDN, have provided attackers with countless new avenues to benefit from the distributed nature of DDoS attacks. The attackers protect their anonymity by infecting distributed devices and utilizing them to create a bot army to constitute a large-scale attack. Thus, the development of an effective as well as efficient DDoS defense mechanism becomes an immediate goal. In this exposition, the authors present a DDoS threat analysis along with a few novel ground-breaking defense mechanisms proposed by various researchers for numerous domains.

734	实体经济	Blockchain Power Trading and Energy Management Platform	In this study, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, and blockchain technology were combined to develop a vehicle-to-everything blockchain power trading and energy management platform with the objective of enabling multi-level power transactions for electric vehicle charging stations in or between commercial buildings. The proposed platform considers green power transactions across microgrids, bidirectional power and green power charging and discharging transactions in microgrids, demand response bidding, and vehicle-to-vehicle emergency rescue charging. This innovative architecture operates smart contracts and distributed ledgers independently; uses smart contracts to handle bidding, matching, and settlement of the power trading platform; and simultaneously employs the cloud and local distributed ledger nodes to chain the detailed real-time transaction information and power data on the ledger. In this manner, the security and fairness of data can be ensured; furthermore, a large amount of chaining information can be processed, and the chaining latency can be shortened. In addition, the communication protocols are integrated through the artificial intelligence of things. An energy management system (EMS) is proposed, which can perform optimal charging and discharging scheduling according to the power transaction matching results and then control charging piles and energy storage system devices. It can reduce the operating cost of microgrids in commercial buildings, increase the efficiency of green power utilization, and reduce power loss. In this system, power transactions are automatically and simultaneously executed in the EMS to achieve real-time supply and demand balance of regional microgrids.	blockchains;microgrids;electric vehicle charging;power markets;power generation;smart contracts;renewable energy sources;artificial intelligence;blockchain;distributed ledger;energy management system;internet of things;power trading;v2x blockchain platformefficient;security;internet;scheme

736	实体经济	RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF "BLOCKCHAIN plus INDUSTRY EDUCATION INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE" ON ALLEVIATING THE ANXIETY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS	Background: Vocational college students are at the junction of study and employment, and are facing the dual pressure of study and employment, so they are very easy to have employment anxiety. Too much anxiety or too long anxiety will make individuals fall into a negative emotional dilemma, making it difficult for individuals to adjust their emotions, thus threatening the physical and mental health of patients, and bringing great trouble and damage to individual growth and development and social stability. The mode of industry education integration and collaborative education can improve students' practical ability and alleviate their employment anxiety. However, there are many defects in the current collaborative education mode of industry education integration. Therefore, the research takes educational psychology as the theoretical research tool and proposes to combine the technical characteristics of blockchain with industry education integration enterprises to improve and innovate the collaborative education mode of industry education integration, so as to enhance students' practical ability and ability to control their own emotions, less anxiety. Subjects and methods: In a higher vocational college, 100 students were selected as the research object. With the help of stratified sampling method, the research objects are divided into different groups according to the differences of teaching modes, namely, the intervention group and the conventional group. Both groups adopt the production teaching mode and the writing education mode for teaching experiments. The difference is that the intervention group carries out teaching based on educational psychology and blockchain development technology, and analyzes the effect based on the psychological status and learning performance of students after teaching intervention. Results: Before teaching, there was no significant difference in SAS scores between the two groups. After teaching, the anxiety of the students in the intervention group who adopted the teaching innovation model was significantly relieved. Conclusions: Looking for a suitable method to reduce the employment pressure of college students and their employment anxiety can effectively achieve the healthy growth of students and the harmony and stability of social groups. Therefore, the research introduced educational psychology as a theoretical teaching tool, combined with the industry education integration enterprise to improve and innovate the collaborative education mode of industry education integration, so as to enhance students' practical ability and self-confidence and alleviate students' anxiety.	integration of industry and education;anxiety;blockchain;educational psychologydepression
737	核心技术	Comparative Analysis of Energy Costs of Asymmetric vs Symmetric Encryption-Based Security Applications	Public key algorithms are heavily used in many digital applications including key establishment schemes, secure messaging apps, and digital signature schemes in cryptocurrencies. Recent developments in the field of quantum computation have placed these algorithms at risk as they enable the implementation of more effective attacks to derive the secret key. Most notably Shor's algorithm exponentially speeds up solving the factoring, discrete logarithm (DLP), and elliptic-curve discrete logarithm (ECDLP) problems. To address this challenge, NIST has initiated a process to develop and standardize a new quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithm. However, asymmetric encryption schemes are known to be computationally intensive, hence energy demanding. The proliferation of energy-constrained internet of things devices, combined with the need to adopt higher complexity quantum resilient cryptographic algorithms, makes it more challenging to continue to use public-key algorithms for all applications. One approach to address these challenges is to adopt symmetric key systems, which are known to be more energy-efficient and more resilient to quantum computers-based attacks. This work performs a comprehensive comparison of energy costs between asymmetric and symmetric key schemes. This comparison is performed using two methods. The first approach uses the energy cost of data usage (ECDU) metric to evaluate the global energy costs associated with internet data usage. It was found that the annual energy consumed by applications associated with public-key cryptography globally is sufficient to provide electricity for 1000 UK households for a year. The second method uses an experimental technique based on constructing a small-scale network of wireless embedded devices. This is subsequently used to compare two key establishment schemes, symmetric and asymmetric, which allows for comparing the computation and communication costs of each solution in a controlled environment, and more importantly estimating the energy consumed by each device participating in the protocol. Our results show that a 58% saving in global energy costs of public key-based applications can be achieved by adopting symmetric key systems. It was also found that a 20% reduction of the energy consumed by a wireless device during a key agreement protocol, can be achieved if symmetric key encryption is used.	costs;encryption;servers;protocols;public key cryptography;wireless communication;sockets;symmetric-key encryption;public-key cryptography;key exchange protocols;digital signatures;energypower-consumption;lightweight;internet;quantum
738	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Information Sharing Mechanism	This paper proposes a blockchain-based supply chain information operation method to solve the current shortage of business information sharing in the supply chain. These approaches include the idea of blockchain application to realize the sharing of supply chain information, the supply chain architecture of production enterprises based on blockchain, and the hierarchical model of supply chain information flow based on blockchain. This paper proposes the information block recording method of internal and external data sources in the supply chain, including the composition structure and the analysis of the multisource data inside and outside the supply chain. In addition, the multisource data information block recording method is also proposed. Building a blockchain-based supply chain system can improve the integration and reconstruction capabilities of the supply chain. The information recording of the internal data of the supply chain and the external related multisource data in the block can improve the learnability of the supply chain. The internal and external information block connection of the supply chain system is the further integration and reconstruction of the supply chain information resources in the blockchain system. The information storage and access control of the blockchain-based supply chain is an information security guarantee system in the supply chain information sharing environment. Through the method of this study, the system can form a business architecture system based on blockchain-based supply chain information sharing.	supply chains;business;blockchains;information sharing;authentication;production;supply and demand;blockchain;mechanism;supply chain information sharing;securitysecurity
739	协同技术	A Novel Blockchain Based Secured and QoS Aware IoT Vehicular Network in Edge Cloud Computing	A software-defined vehicular network is made up of an IoT (Internet of Things) based vehicular ad-hoc network and a software-defined network. For better communication in IoT based vehicle networks, researchers are now working on the VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network) to increase the overall system performance. To maximize the VANET ad-hoc network's information application performance and reliability, edge computing has gained the attention of researchers. In current research, cloud computing is used for message related task execution, which increases the response time. We propose a Software-defined Fault Tolerance and QoS-Aware (Quality of Service) IoT-Based Vehicular Networks Using Edge Computing Secured by Blockchain to reduce overall communication delay, message failure fault tolerance, and secure service provisioning for VANET ad-hoc networks in this article. We proposed heuristic algorithms to solve the above mentioned problems of response delay, message failure, fault tolerance, and security provided by the Blockchain. The proposed model gets vehicle messages through SDN (Software defined network) nodes, which are placed on nearby edge servers, and the edge servers are validated by the blockchain to provide secure services to vehicles. The SDN controller, which exists on an edge server, which is placed on the road side to overcome communication delays, receives different messages from the vehicles and divides these messages in to two different categories. The message division is performed by the edge server by judging the time line, size, and emergency situation. SDN controller organized these messages and forwarded them to their destination. After the message is delivered to its destination, a fault tolerance mechanism checks their acknowledgements. If the message delivery fails, the fault tolerance algorithm will resend the failure message. The proposed model is implemented using a custom simulator and compared with the latest VANET based QoS and fault tolerance models. The result shows the performance of the proposed model, which decreased the overall message communication delay by 55% of the normal and emergency messages by using the edge server SDN controller. Furthermore, the proposed model reduces the execution time, security risk, and message failure ratio by using the edge server, cloud server and blockchain infrastructure.	ad hoc networks;vehicular ad hoc networks;blockchains;servers;security;cloud computing;delays;vehicular ad-hoc network;quality of service;fault-tolerance;iot systems;security;response time;cloud;edge computinglatency;internet;simulation;algorithm;efficient;toolkit;things
740	协同技术	An Edge-Cloud Collaborative Cross-Domain Identity-Based Authentication Protocol with Privacy Protection	Edge-cloud collaborative application scenario is more complex, it involves collaborative operations among different security domains, frequently accessing and exiting application system of mobile terminals. A cross-domain identity authentication protocol based on privacy protection is proposed. The main advantages of the protocol are as follows. 1) Self-certified key generation algorithm: the public/private key pair of the mobile terminal is generated by the terminal members themselves. It avoids security risks caused by third-party key distribution and key escrow; 2) Cross-domain identity authentication: the alliance keys are calculated among edge servers through blockchain technology. Cross-domain identity authentication is realized through the signature authentication of the alliance domain. The cross-domain authentication process is simple and efficient; 3) Revocability of identity authentication: When the mobile terminal has logged off or exited the system, the legal identity of the terminal in the system will also become invalid immediately, so as to ensure the forward and backward security of accessing system resources. Under the hardness assumption of discrete logarithm problem and computational Diffie-Hellman problem, the security of the protocol is proven, and the efficiency of the protocol is verified.	identity authentication;privacy protection;edge-cloud collaborative;revocability identityscheme;blockchain;architecture;management
741	实体经济	IoMT-Based Osteosarcoma Cancer Detection in Histopathology Images Using Transfer Learning Empowered with Blockchain, Fog Computing, and Edge Computing	Bone tumors, such as osteosarcomas, can occur anywhere in the bones, though they usually occur in the extremities of long bones near metaphyseal growth plates. Osteosarcoma is a malignant lesion caused by a malignant osteoid growing from primitive mesenchymal cells. In most cases, osteosarcoma develops as a solitary lesion within the most rapidly growing areas of the long bones in children. The distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus are the most frequently affected bones, but virtually any bone can be affected. Early detection can reduce mortality rates. Osteosarcoma's manual detection requires expertise, and it can be tedious. With the assistance of modern technology, medical images can now be analyzed and classified automatically, which enables faster and more efficient data processing. A deep learning-based automatic detection system based on whole slide images (WSIs) is presented in this paper to detect osteosarcoma automatically. Experiments conducted on a large dataset of WSIs yielded up to 99.3% accuracy. This model ensures the privacy and integrity of patient information with the implementation of blockchain technology. Utilizing edge computing and fog computing technologies, the model reduces the load on centralized servers and improves efficiency.	blockchain;fog computing;edge computing;osteosarcoma cancer;transfer learning;iomtgrey wolf optimizer;feature-selection;classification;diagnosis;segmentation;melanoma;network;tumor;deep
742	实体经济	Framework to enable pharmacist access to health care data using Blockchain technology and artificial intelligence	Background: Decentralization and authentication are embedded in blockchain technology, which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure seamless sharing of data among different health care providers while safeguarding data privacy. Although community pharmacists are highly accessible to patients and possess robust clinical knowledge, they are limited in the clinical services they can provide owing to their lack of access to patient health records. We proposed a blockchain- and AI-based conceptual framework by performing a scoping review of successful blockchain integration in health systems. Objective: To formulate a conceptual framework based on a scoping review to improve access to health care data in the community pharmacy setting through the adoption of blockchain technology and AI. Methods: We performed a scoping review of literature based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses review criteria to identify the specific areas where blockchain can be implemented in health systems. We utilized the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process (PPCP) to identify 2 critical areas for blockchain integration that can support community pharmacists to access patient electronic health records and implement patient-specific information in clinical decision-making. Results: We included 7 articles out of 70 articles in our final review. The 2 areas in the PPCP identified for the use of blockchain on the basis of the literature review were "Assess" and "Implement." Our proposed model involves pharmacists using AI and blockchain technology to comprehensively assess any concerns with the prescribed medication through access to laboratory results for patients and then implement a plan based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's health record. Conclusions: Utilizing blockchain to securely share health data with community pharmacies has the potential to improve patient outcomes, optimize medication safety, and amplify pharmacists' roles in patient care. Future research should focus on implementing the model in the real-world settings. (C) 2022 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	medication
743	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Privacy Access Control Mechanism and Collaborative Analysis for Medical Images	Medical image analysis technology based on deep learning has played an important role in computer-aided disease diagnosis and treatment. Classification accuracy has always been the primary goal pursued by researchers. However, the image transmission process also faces the problems of limited wireless ad-hoc network (WAN) bandwidth and increased security risks. Moreover, when user data are exposed to unauthorized users, platforms can easily leak personal privacy. Aiming at the abovementioned problems, a system model and an access control scheme for the collaborative analysis of the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy (DR) are constructed in this paper. The system model includes two stages of data cleaning and lesion classification. In the data cleaning phase, the private cloud writes the model obtained after training into the blockchain, and other private clouds use the best-performing model on the chain to identify the image quality when cleaning data and pass the high-quality image to the lesion classification model for use. In the lesion classification stage, each private cloud trains the classification model separately; uploads its own model parameters to the public cloud for aggregation to obtain a global model; and then sends the global model to each private cloud to achieve collaborative learning, reduce the amount of data transmission, and protect personal privacy. Access control schemes include improved role-based access control (RAC) used within the private cloud and blockchain-based access control used during the interaction between the private cloud and the public cloud program (BAC). RAC grants both functional rights and data access rights to roles and takes into account object attributes for fine-grained level control. Based on certificateless public-key encryption technology and blockchain technology, BAC can realize the identity authentication and authority identification of the private cloud while requesting the transmission of model parameters from the private cloud to the public cloud and protect the security of the identity, authority, and model parameters of the private cloud to achieve the effect of lightweight access control. In the experimental part, two retinal datasets are used for DR classification analysis. The results show that data cleaning can effectively remove low-quality images and improve the accuracy of early lesion classification for doctors, with an accuracy rate of 90.2%.	
744	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Access Control Techniques for IoT Applications	The Internet of Things is gaining more importance in the present era of Internet technology. It is considered as one of the most important technologies of everyday life. Moreover, IoT systems are ceaselessly growing with more and more devices. They are scalable, dynamic, and distributed, hence the origin of the crucial security requirements in IoT. One of the most challenging issues that the IoT community must handle recently is how to ensure an access control approach that manages the security requirements of such a system. Traditional access control technologies are not suitable for a large-scale and distributed network structure. Most of them are based on a centralized approach, where the use of a trusted third party (TTP) is obligatory. Furthermore, the emergence of blockchain technology has allowed researchers to come up with a solution for these security issues. This technology is highly used to record access control data. Additionally, it has great potential for managing access control requests. This paper proposed a blockchain-based access control taxonomy according to the access control nature: partially decentralized and fully decentralized. Furthermore, it presents an overview of blockchain-based access control solutions proposed in different IoT applications. Finally, the article analyzes the proposed works according to certain criteria that the authors deem important.	internet of things (iot);blockchain;access control;iot applications;fully decentralized;partially decentralizedsecurity;internet;management;privacy;architecture;challenges;scheme

At the same time, to solve the problem of master node selection and low efficiency in the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm, a reward mechanism based on node behavior is introduced and an improved PBFT algorithm is proposed. The improved PBFT algorithm is more efficient, in line with the application scenarios of the IIoT.

746	实体经济	Application of 5G Internet of Things Multisensor Information Fusion Model in Piano Performance	In this paper, we use melodic multisensor information fusion combined with 5G IoT to conduct an in-depth study and analysis of the experience model of piano performance. In the form of multimodal data, two main storage forms, audio and MIDI, are chosen. First, audio signal processing technology and deep learning technology are used to extract shallow and high-level feature sequences in turn, and then, the alignment of the two modal data is completed with the help of sequence alignment algorithm. For the problem that encrypted data cannot be queried by uploading blockchain, this paper proposes an IoT encrypted data query mechanism based on blockchain and Bloom's filter. The blockchain stores IoT encrypted indexes by temporal attributes to ensure data consistency, tamper-evident, and traceability. A new loss function training multimodal model is designed for piano performance signals. The piano performance generated by this model differs from the traditional piano performance generation in that it does not need to add complex piano performance rules manually but generates piano performance directly with piano performance theory rules by training the initial piano performance dataset and improves the stability of the generated piano performance by chord constraints and enhances the note dependence on time. In the analysis of the experimental results, the generated melodies were invited 50 for evaluation and analysis. The overall style-based GAN network piano performance generation model proposed in the study makes the generated piano performance melodies more pleasing to the ear through chord constraints and the content of autonomous learning moments, which has important theoretical and practical implications for the creation and realization of mass and batch piano performances.	
747	技术治理	Cryptocurrency malware detection in real-world environment: Based on multi-results stacking learning	Cryptocurrency mining malware (CryptocMal) has been proliferating due to its high profitability and anonymity. There are many studies using machine learning methods to build CryptocMal detectors and other malware detectors. However, these detection methods tend to test their performance on small datasets only, and such testing conditions make researchers often doubt the real-world performance of these machine learning methods. Some deep learning methods that do not require expert knowledge of malware further reinforce this suspicion. In this paper, different from previous studies, the heuristic rule features set for the machine learning model are designed based on CryptocMal characteristics. Furthermore, the heuristic rule features are integrated as a domain knowledge component in an ensemble learning framework, called CMalHunt. CMalHunt utilized the stacking method to combine results of domain knowledge features, behavior features and binary bytes features. Through integrating classification models with different feature types, the experimental results show that CMalHunt significantly outperforms the baseline machine learning models. These results also validate our conjecture about feature types integration, indicating that each feature can play a role in the CryptocMal detection task. This paper is informative for real-world applications of machine learning in malware identification and malware family classification.

748	市场治理	Analysis of Platform Economic Supervision Mode from the Perspective of Blockchain	In order to analyze the supervision mode of the platform economy from the perspective of blockchain, a blockchain-based method is proposed for the supervision mode of the platform economy. First, in terms of the speed of data collection, the economic monitoring and forecasting based on network big data are real-time from data acquisition to data analysis, so that problems can be detected earlier and serve the purpose of early warning of economic monitoring and forecasting; secondly, in the scope of data monitoring, data that has not been monitored in traditional fields becomes possible; thirdly, in data mining analysis, it can reflect more unpredictable knowledge laws. It proves that from the perspective of block chain, the platform pays the highest attention to the two indicators of taxation and establishment, accounting for 31.10% and 24.38%, respectively. The platform economic supervision model can also find certain correlations from the massive data and then analyze the laws of economic operation and find the influencing factors behind the phenomenon, so as to serve the supervision model.

The results reveal that social trust among acquaintances and social trust among strangers have heterogeneous impacts on corporate collaborative innovation: Trust in strangers promotes firms' collaborative innovation more than trust in acquaintances. We then analyze the external governance effects of blockchain applications, including the direct impact of blockchain applications on firms' collaborative innovation, and the indirect impact of blockchain applications on the relationship between social trust and corporate collaborative innovation. We find that blockchain application enhances collaborative innovation and strengthens the positive impact of social trust on collaborative innovation. These results indicate that the application of blockchain technology improves the performances of firms' collaborative innovation. It is therefore advisable for firms and governments to construct an ecosystem to facilitate the application of blockchain technologies.	blockchain application;collaborative innovation;social trust;digital economyknowledge;cooperation;contract;firm;appropriation;performance;alliances;internet;design

The requirements for the delivery service time are very high due to the features of perishable and highly easy dehydration of fresh agricultural goods. To preserve the freshness and quality of agricultural goods, the logistics and distribution process must be completed as rapidly as possible via appropriate low temperature control and the use of IoT technology. IoT technology will surely bring about the intelligent operation in the circulation of agricultural products. With the decentralized management of the Fabric blockchain, the investment and maintenance costs of the agricultural IoT will be reduced, which will help to improve the intelligence and scale of the agricultural IoT. Aiming at the specific problems, the path optimization problem in the process of agricultural product distribution is brought out.

We explore a setting where a port provides blockchain service with different service levels. We extend the existing literature, which discusses the servitization with blockchain in the maritime supply chain. We demonstrate both the economic and environmental benefits that blockchain service increases the operational efficiency of the port by paperless. Moreover, the port can be realized the reduction on congestion through different supply chain capacities. In addition, we find the rational strategy, including the changes in cost structure, profitability with the time reduction, the value of blockchain service in the market segment, consumer surplus, and social welfare, and the relationship between blockchain service and congestion, respectively. Furthermore, this study embodies the potential contributions of three aspects. Specifically, we reveal the role of blockchain service in the operational time of port with information transformation from paper documents to e-documents. Moreover, we find that the governance strategy of servitization with blockchain service is based on economic benefit and environmental benefits. Finally, we provide a new method to solve port congestion in the maritime supply chain. Therefore, from the perspective of management insight, the port needs to improve the operational efficiency through the blockchain technology with paperless to help consumers to increase the service experience. In addition, the port should also be concerned about the role of blockchain service in the environmental protection and port congestion. In this case, the port can adjust the strategy in order to satisfy the requirements of every stakeholder.	servitization;economic and environmental governance;blockchain service;maritime supply chain;service strategyshipping lines;technology;quality;competition;decisions;impact;future;market;price;congestion
753	实体经济	Blockchain-based secure and trusted data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicle underlying 5G	This paper proposes a blockchain-based secure and reliable data sharing scheme for autonomous vehicles (AVs). It aims to secure data sharing among AVs. We integrate the fifth-generation (5G) communication network with the proposed blockchain-based scheme to enable ultra-low latency, high reliability, and availability. We have incorporated the edge intelligence nodes (EINs) with blockchain for efficient data processing. We have used a random forest classifier model (RFCM) on the road accidents dataset to predict the accident severity, i.e., fatal, serious, and slight. It is based on road type, light condition, and vehicle movement to be shared among other AVs. We have considered various scenarios and performed the predictive analysis that needs to be secured by using blockchain technology. Results of the study demonstrate the accuracy of RFCM as 93%, the precision of 98%, 97%, and 87% for fatal, serious, and slight categories of accident severity, respectively. The results show that the proposed scheme with RFCM yields better accuracy of 93% than other existing classification algorithms such as Decision tree, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. The blockchain-based proposed system has been compared with the traditional approach based on parameters such as network latency, scalability, computation time, delay comparison for node validation, data storage latency, and data storage cost. Obtained results show that the proposed scheme enables the data sharing reliable, secure, and efficient for AVs and outperforms the blockchain and non-blockchain systems in terms of security and efficiency.	blockchain;random forest;latency;scalability;edge intelligence;5g

755	核心技术	Blockchain Consensus Mechanism Based on Quantum Teleportation	The consensus mechanism is the core secret of the blockchain network. However, the consensus mechanism of the classical blockchain is based on the classical cryptosystem, which is based on the problem of computational complexity. With the improvement of computing power, the security of this cryptosystem is being threatened. In addition, the consensus mechanism of classic blockchain also has the following disadvantages: serious waste of computing resources and energy; the inability to withstand a 51% attack; low system throughput and large delay. Based on quantum teleportation technology and the randomness of quantum measurement, a consensus mechanism for a quantum blockchain system is proposed. Based on the physical properties of quantum mechanics, this scheme has the unconditional security of quantum cryptography. This new consensus mechanism does not involve a great deal of computing resources and hence has a lower energy consumption, shorter time delay and higher throughput. Furthermore, the new consensus mechanism could withstand a 51% attack.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;quantum teleportation;quantum measurement
756	核心技术	A Public Blockchain Consensus Mechanism for Fault-Tolerant Distributed Computing in LEO Satellite Communications	In LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite communication systems, the satellite network is made up of a large number of satellites, the dynamically changing network environment affects the results of distributed computing. In order to improve the fault tolerance rate, a novel public blockchain consensus mechanism that applies a distributed computing architecture in a public network is proposed. Redundant calculation of blockchain ensures the credibility of the results; and the transactions with calculation results of a task are stored distributed in sequence in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG). The transactions issued by nodes are connected to form a net. The net can quickly provide node reputation evaluation that does not rely on third parties. Simulations show that our proposed blockchain has the following advantages: 1. The task processing speed of the blockchain can be close to that of the fastest node in the entire blockchain; 2. When the tasks' arrival time intervals and demanded working nodes(WNs) meet certain conditions, the network can tolerate more than 50% of malicious devices; 3. No matter the number of nodes in the blockchain is increased or reduced, the network can keep robustness by adjusting the task's arrival time interval and demanded WNs.	distributed computing;public blockchain network;consensus mechanism;credibility;fault-tolerance
757	实体经济	Privacy-Preserving, Scalable Blockchain-Based Solution for Monitoring Industrial Infrastructure in the Near Real-Time	This paper proposes an improved monitoring and measuring system dedicated to industrial infrastructure. Our model achieves security of data by incorporating cryptographical methods and near real-time access by the use of virtual tree structure over records. The currently available blockchain networks are not very well adapted to tasks related to the continuous monitoring of the parameters of industrial installations. In the database systems delivered by default (the so-called world state), only the resultant or the last value recorded by the IoT device is stored. Effective use of measurement values recorded in the past requires each time viewing the entire chain of recorded events for a given IoT device. The solution proposed in the article introduces the concept of dependent wallets, the purpose of which is the aggregation and indexation of changes in machine parameters, recorded in the original wallets. As a result, we can easily get data from a certain sensor or sensors in the specified date range, even if the chain of transactions is very long. Our contribution is a universal mechanism that improves the efficiency of the infrastructure monitoring process, which uses blockchains to record measurements from sensors. The proposed model has been experimentally tested on two types of blockchains: Stellar and Hyperledger Fabric.	blockchain;hyperledger fabric;stellar;iotiot security
758	实体经济	Adoption of Blockchain Technology for Privacy and Security in the Context of Industry 4.0	Compared to centralized and decentralized models, distributed models have the potential to dramatically expand the scalability of existing IoT and Industry 4.0 solutions while maintaining participant organizations' security and privacy. This is partly because participating firms are not required to rely on or trust other services or third parties to manage the data they gather and transfer, out of concern that these parties could misuse the data or, in the worst-case scenario, share it with mass surveillance programs. However, until blockchain technology (BCT) demonstrates its viability as a means of developing security solutions in decentralized, collaborative, and trustless environments, the vast majority of these use cases will struggle to meet the requirements for integrity, immutability, traceability, and notarization. By utilizing BCT, it is possible to eliminate intermediaries, enabling individuals and devices to manage their data independently of third parties and most significantly to achieve a high level of traceability with information flow harmony. This technology enables transaction, transparency, and traceability by enabling for the interchange of historical data. The fundamentals of blockchain are examined in this research paper, along with an investigation of its operation and a discussion of some of its most fundamental aspects and concepts. A concise overview of smart contracts enables us to completely reimagine how network members create and automate transactions. Finally, several IoT and Industry 4.0 application possibilities that leverage blockchain are investigated, as is the blockchain's future trajectory.	supply chain;challenges
759	平台项目	Attribute-based access control scheme for data sharing on hyperledger fabric	With the popularization of the IoT and big data, the application value of data has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is particularly important to ensure the legitimate use of privacy data in the process of data sharing through access control. Traditional schemes usually use a trusted central organization to implement access control. However, a fully trusted central organization does not exist, and the access process of centralized access control is also opaque. In order to solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a decentralized attribute-based and fine-grained access control scheme for data sharing on Hyperledger Fabric. Firstly, the encrypted data is stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the returned hash is saved in the blockchain, by virtue of the immutability of blockchain. Secondly, a decentralized fine-grained attribute-based access control through smart contracts to prevent unauthorized users from accessing data resource. Thirdly, the linear integer secret sharing algorithm is used to achieve symmetric key sharing among multiple attributes to ensure the security of the key. Finally, the security analysis of the proposed scheme and the performance evaluation using the Hyperledger Caliper tool show the feasibility and effectiveness of the new scheme.	data sharing;hyperledger fabric;decentralized;attribute-based access control;linear integer secret sharingencryption
760	核心技术	Latest trends of security and privacy in recommender systems: A comprehensive review and future perspectives	With the widespread use of Internet of things (IoT), mobile phones, connected devices and artificial intelligence (AI), recommender systems (RSs) have become a booming technology because of their capability to analyze big data and shape users' habits through well-designed, contextual, and engaging recommendations. Novel generations of RSs have been developed based on the latest AI and machine learning (ML) technologies such as big data RSs, ML-based RSs, explainable RSs, fusion-based RSs, etc. However, the characteristics of modern RSs raise new security and privacy issues because of the sensitivity of users' data and its vulnerability to being illegally accessed. Moreover, there is a lack of thorough reviews that explain the current privacy and security challenges in RSs and where the actual research is heading. To overcome these issues, this paper sheds light on the existing security and privacy concerns in modern RSs. It provides a comprehensive survey of recent research efforts on security and privacy preservation in RSs. Typically, the security and privacy aspects in advanced RSs and the latest contributions are first discussed based on a well-defined taxonomy. Next, the applications of secure and privacy-preserving RSs are studied. Moving forward, a critical analysis is conducted to (i) highlight the merits and drawbacks of existing frameworks and (ii) draw the essential findings. Lastly, future directions that attract significant research and development attention are explained. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

763	协同技术	Multi-Constrained and Edge-Enabled Selection of UAV Participants in Federated Learning Process	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained increasing attention in boosting the performance of conventional networks due to their small size, high efficiency, low cost, and autonomously nature. The amalgamation of UAVs with both distributed/collaborative Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, such as Federated Learning (FL), and Blockchain technology have ushered in a new paradigm of Secure Multi-Access Edge Computing (S-MEC). Indeed, FL enables UAV devices to leverage their sensed data to build local DL models. The latter are then sent to a central node, e.g., S-MEC node, for aggregation, in order to generate a global DL model. Therefore, FL enables UAV devices to collaborate during several FL rounds in generating a learning model, while avoiding to share their local data, and thus ensuring UAVs' privacy. However, UAV devices are usually limited in terms of resources such as battery, memory, and CPU. Some of the UAV devices may not be able to build a local learning models due to their resources capacity. Hence, there is a great need to select the adequate UAVs at each FL round, that are able to build a local DL model based on their resource capacities. In this paper, we design a novel and S-MEC-enabled framework that optimizes the selection of UAV participants at each FL training round, named FedSel. FedSel considers the available UAVs along with their resource capacities, in terms of energy, CPU, and memory, to determine which UAV device is able to participant in the FL process. Thus, we formulate the UAV selection problem as an Integer Linear Program, which considers the aforementioned constraints. We also prove that this problem is NP-hard, and suggest a Tabu Search (TS) metaheuristic-based approach to resolve it. Moreover, FedSel is built on top of blockchain technology, in order to ensure a secure selection of UAV participants, and hence building reliable FL-based models. Simulation results validate the efficiency of our FedSel scheme in balancing computational load among available UAVs and optimizing the UAV selection process.	uav networks;federated deep learning;uavs selection;blockchain;edge computingnetworks

In contrast, these architectures constitute a system to realize the concept of smart cities and, ultimately, a smart planet. The adoption of these smart devices expands to different cyber-physical systems in smart city architecture, i.e., smart houses, smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, smart agriculture, etc. The edge of the network connects these smart devices (sensors, aggregators, and actuators) that can operate in the physical environment and collects the data, which is further used to make an informed decision through actuation. Here, the security of these devices is immensely important, specifically from an authentication standpoint, as in the case of unauthenticated/malicious assets, the whole infrastructure would be at stake. We provide an updated review of authentication mechanisms by categorizing centralized and distributed architectures. We discuss the security issues regarding the authentication of these IoT-enabled smart devices. We evaluate and analyze the study of the proposed literature schemes that pose authentication challenges in terms of computational costs, communication overheads, and models applied to attain robustness. Hence, lightweight solutions in managing, maintaining, processing, and storing authentication data of IoT-enabled assets are an urgent need. From an integration perspective, cloud computing has provided strong support. In contrast, decentralized ledger technology, i.e., blockchain, light-weight cryptosystems, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, are the areas with much more to explore. Finally, we discuss the future research challenges, which will eventually help address the ambiguities for improvement.	smart device;smart city;blockchain;decentralized ledger technology (dlt);cyber-physical system;internet of things;iot;security;authenticationlayer authentication;security techniques;things iot;internet;challenges;framework;efficient;network;lightweight;protection
765	实体经济	Computing in the Sky: A Survey on Intelligent Ubiquitous Computing for UAV-Assisted 6G Networks and Industry 4.0/5.0	Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used in a high-computation paradigm enabled with smart applications in the Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) wireless communication networks. These networks have an avenue for generating a considerable amount of heterogeneous data by the expanding number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart environments. However, storing and processing massive data with limited computational capability and energy availability at local nodes in the IoT network has been a significant difficulty, mainly when deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to extract discriminatory information from the massive amount of data for different tasks.Therefore, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has evolved as a promising computing paradigm leveraged with efficient technology to improve the quality of services of edge devices and network performance better than cloud computing networks, addressing challenging problems of latency and computation-intensive offloading in a UAV-assisted framework. This paper provides a comprehensive review of intelligent UAV computing technology to enable 6G networks over smart environments. We highlight the utility of UAV computing and the critical role of Federated Learning (FL) in meeting the challenges related to energy, security, task offloading, and latency of IoT data in smart environments. We present the reader with an insight into UAV computing, advantages, applications, and challenges that can provide helpful guidance for future research.	uavs;uav computing;ai;federated learning;b5g;industry 4;0;mec;smart environment;iotenabled wireless networks;mobile edge networks;resource-allocation;trajectory design;artificial-intelligence;power transfer;optimization;challenges;management;blockchain
766	实体经济	Blockchain Private File Storage-Sharing Method Based on IPFS	Under the current national network environment, anyone can participate in publishing. As an important information resource, knowledge files reflect the workload of publishers. Moreover, high-quality knowledge files can promote the progress of society. However, pirated inferior files have the opposite effect. At present, most organizations use centralized servers to centrally manage the knowledge files released by users. In addition, it is necessary to introduce an untrusted third party to examine and encrypt the contents of files, which leads to an opaque process of file storage transactions, tampering with intellectual copyright, and the inability to have consistent systems of file management among institutions due to the lack of uniform standards for the same intellectual files. The purpose of this paper is to ensure the safe storage of knowledge files on the one hand and to realize efficient sharing of copyrighted files on the other hand. Therefore, this paper combines NDN (Named Data Network) technology with a distributed blockchain and an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and proposes a blockchain knowledge file storage and sharing method based on an NDN. The method uses the NDN itself for the file content signature and encryption, thereby separating the file security and transmission process. At the same time, the method uses a flexible NDN reverse path forwarding and routing strategy, combining an IPFS private storage network to improve the safety of the encrypted data storage security. Finally, the method takes advantage of all participating nodes consensus and shares files in the synchronized blockchain to ensure traceability. This paper introduces the structure and principles of the method and describes the process of file upload and transfer. Finally, the performance of the method is compared and evaluated, and the advantages and disadvantages of the method and the future research direction are summarized.	blockchain;decentralization;ndn;ipfs;shared storage
767	核心技术	Selection Strategy of Mining Pool under Various Different Payment Mechanisms	Blockchain is becoming increasingly popular and has received extensive attention in various fields. In a proof-of-work-based blockchain, miners usually choose to join a mining pool for mining to gain revenue. Different mining pools may use other payment mechanisms, and each miner can earn different revenues in different pools. There are currently four common payment mechanisms used by mining pools to distribute mining revenue, namely, PPS, PPLNS, PPS+, and FPPS, and there are no relevant research results on the selection strategies of these four payment mechanisms. To this end, this paper models the pool selection problem as a risky decision problem and proposes the selection strategies of these four mining pool payment mechanisms. Firstly, miners' income under the four payment mechanisms is given; then, a mining pool selection strategy based on the change of computing power is constructed based on the Laplace criterion; finally, the proposed strategy is verified and analyzed by simulation. The experiments show that the proposed mining pool selection strategy is effective. The results of this paper can provide an essential reference for miners when making pool selection decisions.	blockchain;game
768	市场治理	'Hodling' on: Memetic storytelling and digital folklore within a cryptocurrency world	People within the cryptocurrency world come together on imageboards and forums to tell stories about the highly volatile and uncertain world they inhabit. Although they engage with a highly technical digital money form, the stories they share online could be more productively analysed as digital folklore. Through ethnography primarily conducted via 4chan and Reddit, I highlight three types of stories, loosely grouped together within the categories of 'despair', 'comedy' and 'courage'. Drawing parallels to folk and fairy tales, I explore how 'netizens' use these stories to engage with the uncertainty that characterizes cryptocurrencies. Consequently, I highlight how stories come to make the online cryptocurrency world more inhabitable, as well as allowing people to subvert and resist 'economic reason'. By foregrounding storytelling, I highlight the fluid, intersubjective and collective actions that help to sustain a volatile and uncertain market that is favourable for those who take to online message boards.	cryptocurrency;speculation;hodling;storytelling;money;memesschemes
769	市场治理	Selecting the Fintech Strategy for Supply Chain Finance: A Hybrid Decision Approach for Banks	Many banks are eager to adopt technology solutions to enhance operational efficiency in managing supply chain finance, which involves various participants and complex financial activities. Previous research either focuses on the technology aspect or the optimization of a supply chain; there is little specific guidance on how banks can form a holistic model to evaluate their Fintech strategy for supply chain finance. By using an integrated approach, this study adopted the decision- making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and several analytical methods to construct a hybrid decision model for banks. We concluded four plausible Fintech strategies from previous research and highlighted the advantages of the blockchain-based strategy. We used a domestic bank in Taiwan as a case study during the evaluation phase and implemented crisp and confidence-based fuzzy assessments. The result indicates that the blockchain-based leading strategy would be ideal for this bank. The hybrid decision model also unveils the complicated relationships among those evaluation factors, which sheds light on banks pursuing their innovation in financial services. The findings contribute to banks developing their Fintech-based supply chain financing business, and the supply chain participants may also benefit from securing efficient loans to expedite their operations.	supply chain finance;banking;blockchain;fintech;hybrid multiple criteria decision-making;fuzzy set theorytechnology adoption;blockchain;optimization;innovation;vikor

771	实体经济	Blockchain-Enabled Smart Grid Applications: Architecture, Challenges, and Solutions	The conventional electrical grid is undergoing substantial growth for reliable grid operation and for more efficient and sustainable energy use. The traditional grid is now metamorphosing into a smart grid (SG) that incorporates a diverse, heterogeneous blend of operating measures such as smart appliances, meters, and renewable energy resources. With better efficient results and dependability, the SG can be described as a modern electric power grid architecture. The SG is one of the greatest potential advances as a promising solution for the energy crisis. However, it is complex and its decentralization could be of tremendous benefit. Moreover, digitalization and integration of a large number of growing connections make it a target of cyber-attacks. In this sense, blockchain is a promising SG paradigm solution that offers several excellent features. There has been considerable effort put into using blockchains in the smart grid for its decentralization and enhanced cybersecurity; however, it has not been thoroughly studied in both application and architectural perspectives. An in-depth study was conducted on blockchain-enabled SG applications. Blockchain architectures for various applications, such as the synchrophasor applications, electric vehicles, energy management systems, etc., were proposed. The purpose of this article is to provide directions for future research efforts aimed at secure and decentralized SG applications using blockchain.	smart grid;blockchain;smart contracts;cybersecurity;microgrids;electric vehicles;energy transactions;energy management;smart cities;advanced metering infrastructure;home automation;smart homesenergy management;internet;framework;system;technologies;communities;networks;security;demand;market

775	实体经济	Game Theory-Based Authentication Framework to Secure Internet of Vehicles with Blockchain	The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a new paradigm for vehicular networks. Using diverse access methods, IoV enables vehicles to connect with their surroundings. However, without data security, IoV settings might be hazardous. Because of the IoV's openness and self-organization, they are prone to malevolent attack. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a revolutionary blockchain-enabled game theory-based authentication mechanism for securing IoVs. Here, a three layer multi-trusted authorization solution is provided in which authentication of vehicles can be performed from initial entry to movement into different trusted authorities' areas without any delay by the use of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in the beginning and later through duel gaming, and a dynamic Proof-of-Work (dPoW) consensus mechanism. Formal and informal security analyses justify the framework's credibility in more depth with mathematical proofs. A rigorous comparative study demonstrates that the suggested framework achieves greater security and functionality characteristics and provides lower transaction and computation overhead than many of the available solutions so far. However, these solutions never considered the prime concerns of physical cloning and side-channel attacks. However, the framework in this paper is capable of handling them along with all the other security attacks the previous work can handle. Finally, the suggested framework has been subjected to a blockchain implementation to demonstrate its efficacy with duel gaming to achieve authentication in addition to its capability of using lower burdened blockchain at the physical layer, which current blockchain-based authentication models for IoVs do not support.	internet of vehicles;security;authentication;game theory;physical unclonable functions;duel game;stochastic duel game;blockchainmutual authentication;v2v communication;efficient;scheme;protocol
776	实体经济	On a Blockchain-Based Security Scheme for Defense against Malicious Nodes in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks	Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) aim to provide a comfortable driving experience. Sharing messages in VANETs can help with traffic management, congestion mitigation, and driving safety. However, forged or false messages may undermine the efficiency of VANETs. In this paper, we propose a security scheme based on blockchain technology, where two types of blockchain are constructed based on roadside units (RSUs) and Certificate Authorities (CAs), respectively. The proposed security scheme has multifold goals to identify malicious nodes and detect forged messages based on multiple factors, such as reputation of sender nodes, and time and distance effectiveness of messages. In addition, an incentive mechanism is introduced on the RSU blockchain to encourage RSUs to adopt active behaviors. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme exhibits superior performances to existing methods in detecting forged messages and identifying malicious nodes. Meanwhile, it provides privacy protection and improves the efficiency of vehicular networks.	vehicular networks;detection of messages;blockchain;consensus mechanism;privacy protectiontrust management;efficient;architecture;model

778	核心技术	On Proof-of-Accuracy Consensus Protocols	Consensus protocols are a fundamental part of any blockchain; although several protocols have been in operation for several years, they still have drawbacks. For instance, some may be susceptible to a 51% attack, also known as a majority attack, which may suppose a high risk to the trustworthiness of the blockchains. Although this attack is theoretically possible, executing it in practice is often regarded as arduous because of the premise that, with sufficiently active members, it is not 'straightforward' to have much computing power. Since it represents a possible vulnerability, the community has made efforts to solve this and other blockchain problems, which has resulted in the birth of alternative consensus protocols, e.g., the proof of accuracy protocol. This paper presents a detailed proposal of a proof-of-accuracy protocol. It aims to democratize the miners' participation within a blockchain, control the miners' computing power, and mitigate the majority attacks.	alternative consensus protocols;blockchain;consensus protocol;proof of accuracy
779	实体经济	` A blockchain-based models for student information systems	Blockchain stores a series of transactions in form of a sequence of linked blocks. Hence, the concept of a single decentralized ledger is easily maintained. Transactions and interactions that take place among the participants accessing the distributed and decentralized but cooperative blockchain network are held through a single ledger. A student information system (SIS) can make use of a decentralized, reliable, and highly trusted ledger that stores vital information. Traditional education systems encounter problems such as centralized record keeping where fault tolerance depends on a single cloud provider; not to mention locally hosted databases. The implementation of blockchain in the education sector provides a new horizon for set of non-functional requirements including but not limited to: security, immutability, independence from the institution, immutability of official records and certificates. In addition, total trust in the accuracy and infallibility are all gathered in the decentralized ledgers of blockchain. The proposed models emphasize on the data availability; represented in students' ability to access all of their data at any time. This paper proposes three models for using blockchains to implement fully functional SIS that maintains transactions such as students' and faculty members' records, course registration records and student marks. In addition, avoiding the role of a super administrator or a centralized exposed store where data integrity is vulnerable. Using the proposed models pushes towards an electronic community where genuine certificates can be easily issued and published to the interested parties without the need for involving a centralized administration.

780	核心技术	Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Query Strategies in Blockchain	In various applications of blockchain, how to index spatio-temporal data more efficiently has become a subject of continuous attention. The existing spatio-temporal data query in the blockchain is realized by adding additional external storage or fixed spatio-temporal index in the block, without considering the distribution of the spatio-temporal query itself and the proof performance accompanying the query. We propose an adaptive spatio-temporal blockchain index method, called Verkle AR*-tree, which adds the verification of time and location in the blockchain without additional storage and realizes the spatio-temporal index with an encrypted signature. Verkle AR*-tree further provides an adaptive algorithm, which adjusts the tree structure according to the historical query to produce the optimized index structure. The experimental results based on the pokeman dataset show that compared with the existing static spatio-temporal index, our method can effectively increase the performance of the spatio-temporal query and the spatio-temporal commitment in the blockchain.	blockchain;spatio-temporal index;verkle ar*-tree;adaptive query
781	虚拟经济	Initial coin offerings (ICOs) success: Conceptualization, theories and systematic analysis of empirical studies	Initial coin offerings (ICOs) have recently experienced an explosive expansion in entrepreneurial finance. This novel, crowd-based funding method has successfully attracted tremendous amounts of funds for both new ventures and established businesses. A growing body of research has explored the factors that shape ICO success, yet few studies have synthesized and integrated the findings of the fragmented literature. This paper incorporates signaling theory and a phase-based view of the ICO process to systematically review 78 empirical studies, published between January 2017 and January 2022, on the conceptualization, theories and determinants of ICO success. The review explores six main determinants of ICO success: the founder, ICO, venture, market, investors, and context. The founder initiates the ICO process by deliberately selecting this method for funding their business and choosing the type and quality of signals that both encourage investors and guide their decision to participate in and support the ICO project in different contexts. Based on this review, we develop a model for ICO success, tracking success determinants in each phase of the ICO process. Finally, we highlight agendas for future studies and implications for policy, theory, and practice development.	business fundraising;entrepreneurial finance;cryptocurrency;initial coin offering (ico) success;ico structureentrepreneurs;methodology;decisions;reviews;growth;model
782	协同技术	Identity authentication for edge devices based on zero-trust architecture	Device identity authentication is the first line of defense for edge computing security mechanisms. Many authentication schemes are often accompanied by high communication and computational overhead. In addition, due to the continuous enhancement of network virtualization and dynamics, the security requirements for logical boundaries of many enterprise information systems "cloudification," and the huge data security challenges faced by enterprise core assets, all make the original "one-time authentication, all the way" trust model no longer reliable. Therefore, the paper proposes a local identity authentication and roaming identity authentication protocol based on a zero-trust architecture. First, we propose a revocable group signature scheme, the expiration time is bound to the key of each edge terminal device. According to this solution, since the identity authentication token generated by the expired key is invalid, it does not need to be included in the revocation list, which improves the efficiency of revocation checking. Compared with the current identity authentication protocol, this article not only builds a model based on the zero trust architecture, effectively solves the shortcomings of the network security protection architecture, but also considers the unforgeability of the expiration time, and realizes effective revocation and more efficient identity authentication.	group signature;identity authentication;revocation;roaming authentication;zero trustpassword authentication;scheme;blockchain;efficient

784	实体经济	Blockchain and cloud computing-based secure electronic healthcare records storage and sharing	Healthcare information is essential for both service providers and patients. Further secure sharing and maintenance of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) are imperative. EHR systems in healthcare have traditionally relied on a centralized system (e.g., cloud) to exchange health data across healthcare stakeholders, which may expose private and sensitive patient information. EHR has struggled to meet the demands of several stakeholders and systems in terms of safety, isolation, and other regulatory constraints. Blockchain is a distributed, decentralized ledger technology that can provide secured, validated, and immutable data sharing facilities. Blockchain creates a distributed ledger system using techniques of cryptography (hashes) that are consistent and permit actions to be carried out in a distributed manner without needing a centralized authority. Data exploitation is difficult and evident in a blockchain network due to its immutability. We propose an architecture based on blockchain technology that authenticates the user identity using a Proof of Stake (POS) cryptography consensus mechanism and Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA256) to secure EHR sharing among different electronic healthcare systems. An Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used to verify EHR sensors to assemble and transmit data to cloud infrastructure. Results indicate that the proposed solution performs exceptionally well when compared with existing solutions, which include Proof-Of-Work (POW), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1), and Message Digest (MD5) in terms of power consumption, authenticity, and security of healthcare records.	blockchain;cloud computing;electronic healthcare records;decentralized;internet of thingsframework
785	实体经济	Accounting Transparency, Fear Sentiment and the COVID-19 Epidemic: For Public Health Security and the Construction of an Early Warning System	A central issue of public health security and the construction of an early warning system is to establish a set of responsibility-oriented incentives and restraint mechanisms. This is closely related to the accounting transparency of the institutional environment and the fear sentiment of the individual's predicament. This study analyses the relationship between accounting transparency, fear sentiment, and COVID-19 through a VAR model analysis. The results show a significant and negative relationship between accounting transparency and daily new COVID-19 patients. In particular, accounting transparency has a negative impact on the increase in the number of people infected with a two-period lag, while the three-period lag in the number of new epidemics has a negative impact on accounting information. Second, accounting transparency has a positive impact on the increase in the search volume on COVID-19 within a three-period lag. After the three-period lag, the number of new epidemics has a positive impact on accounting information. Third, an increase in fear sentiment can be driven by the fear of COVID-19. Fourth, in the public health early warning system, according to the abovementioned time characteristics, the system arranges the emotional counseling, early warning incentives, and institutional constraints to be dealt with in the first 4 days. In addition, in the early warning target-oriented system setting, the parallel system helps to improve the early warning efficiency.	fear sentiment;accounting transparency;covid-19;blockchain;public health;public health security early warning systemcorruption;attention;dynamics
786	实体经济	Redactable Blockchain-Enabled Hierarchical Access Control Framework for Data Sharing in Electronic Medical Records	The application of blockchain to data sharing in an untrusted environment has received widespread industry attention in recent years. However, the tamper-proof property of blockchain brings protection for sharing data and also leads to a new limitation for the deletion of malicious data. Nowadays, many methods based on redactable blockchain with a chameleon hash is proposed to attempt to solve the above problem, but loss of effective access control to the modifiers can easily lead to breaking the positive characteristics of the blockchain. To address the aforementioned problem, a hierarchical access control redactable blockchain model for data sharing through attribute-based encryption and a chameleon hash is introduced. Under this model, the data owner can specify who can modify their data by setting an access policy and authenticating the modifier with a digital signature. The data owner's full control over rights is guaranteed, while the modifier's behavior is regulated. In addition, the hierarchical access control decentralized technique solves the overpowerful problem of center authority and single-point-of-failure problems in the existing works. The security analysis indicates that the proposed scheme achieves indistinguishable chosen plaintext attack security as well as collision resistance security. Performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme is more complete and has better efficiency compared with other schemes.	blockchains;authorization;periodic structures;performance analysis;organizations;medical diagnostic imaging;logic gates;attribute-based encryption (abe);blockchain;chameleon hash;data sharingchameleon hash;scheme

789	协同技术	Fusion of Federated Learning and Industrial Internet of Things: A survey	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) lays a new paradigm for the concept of Industry 4.0 and paves an insight for new industrial era. Nowadays smart machines and smart factories use machine learning/deep learning based models for incurring intelligence. However, storing and communicating the data to the cloud and end device leads to issues in preserving privacy. In order to address this issue, Federated Learning (FL) technology is implemented in IIoT by the researchers nowadays to provide safe, accurate, robust and unbiased models. Integrating FL in IIoT ensures that no local sensitive data is exchanged, as the distribution of learning models over the edge devices has become more common with FL. Therefore, only the encrypted notifications and parameters are communicated to the central server. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on integrating FL with IIoT in terms of privacy, resource and data management. The survey starts by articulating IIoT characteristics and fundamentals of distributed machine learning and FL. The motivation behind integrating IIoT and FL for achieving data privacy preservation and on-device learning are summarized. Then we discuss the potential of using machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL) and blockchain techniques for FL in secure IIoT. Further we analyze and summarize several ways to handle the heterogeneous and huge data. Comprehensive background on data and resource management are then presented, followed by applications of IIoT with FL in automotive, robotics, agriculture, energy, and healthcare industries. Finally, we shed light on challenges, some possible solutions and potential directions for future research.	data storage;iiot;federated learning;data privacy;data sharing;resource managementintelligent control;access-control;digital twins;blockchain;privacy;iot;networking;management;efficient;security
790	市场治理	Blockchain for requirements traceability: A qualitative approach	Blockchain technology has emerged as a "disruptive innovation" that has received significant attention in academic and organizational settings. However, most of the existing research is focused on technical issues of blockchain systems, overlooking the organizational perspective. This study adopted a grounded theory to unveil the blockchain implementation process in organizations from the lens of blockchain experts. The results revealed three main categories: key activities, success factors, and challenges related to blockchain implementation in organizations, the latter being identified as the core category, along with 17 other concepts. Findings suggested that the majority of blockchain projects stop at the pilot stage and outlined organizational resistance to change as the core challenge. According to the experts, the following factors contribute to the organizational resistance to change: innovation-production gap, conservative management, and centralized mentality. The study aims to contribute to the existing blockchain literature by providing a holistic and domain-agnostic view of the blockchain implementation process in organizational settings. This can potentially encourage the development and implementation of blockchain solutions and guide practitioners who are interested in leveraging the inherent benefits of this technology. In addition, the results are used to improve a blockchain-enabled requirements traceability framework proposed in our previous paper.	blockchain technology;grounded theory;interorganizational software projects;requirements traceabilitysoftware process improvement;grounded theory;challenges;framework
791	实体经济	An Anonymous Signature-Based Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks	Anonymous authentication is a critical step in safeguarding vehicle privacy and security in VANETs. VANETs connected with blockchain are gaining popularity as a means to increase the effectiveness of anonymous authentication across many security domains. However, present blockchain-assisted authentication systems cannot successfully achieve anonymity since colluding RSUs or vehicles may acquire linkability via the same retrieved record, hence destroying anonymity. To solve the problem, the proposed work offers an unlinkable anonymous signature-based authentication for VANET to ensure collusion resistance. To provide V2R unlinkability, a trusted authority issues anonymous parameters that conceal the vehicle's identification from RSUs and other vehicles in the VANET system. The vehicle user produces anonymous signatures, and RSUs validate them during anonymous authentication. Moreover, the proposed authentication methods are based on an anonymous certificateless signature (ACS) approach that is computationally more efficient and provably safe against eternal forgery in the random oracle model. Additionally, the proposed work guarantees that neither an RSU nor a vehicle has the authority to divulge users' true identities. Hence, the proposed system has stringent unlinkability and better anonymity, and it enhances the efficiency of V2R and V2V communications considerably according to security analysis and performance assessment.	efficient;secure;protocol;communication;management
792	实体经济	Blockchain Based Peer-To-Peer Energy Trading Between Wind Power Producer and Prosumers in Short-Term Market	With the increase of wind power penetration, the deviation caused by its volatility and intermittency poses a growing threat to the grid. Energy trading in short-term markets for wind power and backup storage helps compensate for the deviations. Furthermore, the introduction of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading can effectively reduce the risk of centralized market management. However, the higher cost of energy storage are not conducive to wind power producers (WPPs). And P2P trading also suffers from trust and efficiency problems. This paper provides a blockchain based short-term energy trading market, which resolves generation deviations through efficient and trusted real-time transactions between WPP and prosumers. The blockchain-based energy trading market is a trustless P2P structure, and the trading is triggered by smart contracts to ensure efficiency. Furthermore, a reputation mechanism is designed to incentivize WPP's generation forecasts to be accurate and prosumers to participate in the market. A bilevel optimization method is designed to increase the revenue of WPP and reduce the costs of prosumers. The market can effectively balance the deviation of wind power generation, increase the revenue of WPP by 9.55%, and reduce the costs for consumers by 5.6%.	wind power producer;blockchain;bilevel;energy trading;short-term marketgeneration;system;cost
793	核心技术	A Bilayer Scalable Nakamoto Consensus Protocol for Blockchain Systems	How to simultaneously achieve high security level, good scalability, and full decentralization is still a big issue in the design of a blockchain system. In this article, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer, scalable Nakamoto consensus protocol that is based purely on decentralized Nakamoto consensus. Bicomp works to generate two types of blocks - microblocks for concurrent in-network transaction serialization and macroblocks for chain formation. A leader is elected at the beginning of each round through Proof of Work-based computation; it puts microblocks mined by different nodes into one macroblock at the end of its tenure. Such bilayer design limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to concurrently participate in the transaction serialization process, promoting the sharding nature of the system. Furthermore, several mechanisms are elaborately designed to reduce the transaction overlapping and further limit a leader's power, including a novel transaction diversity-based metric for deciding the branch legality. Security issues and potential attacks to Bicomp are extensively discussed. Experimental results based on 500 nodes all over the world show that Bicomp achieves high throughput performance.	measurement;leadership;voting;scalability;throughput;consensus protocol;security

Blockchain technology, which is still in its infancy in terms of adoption in India, can facilitate SMEs to counter these challenges. Fuelled by this motivation, the study aims to investigate the significant barriers to blockchain adoption in supply chain finance practices by Indian SMEs. Using fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process, sensitivity analysis, and fuzzy-decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory this paper identifies the blockchain barriers, prioritises them and examine their cause and effect relationships. The results of the study indicate that technology barriers are the most influential barriers that impede blockchain adoption. The findings will help the policymakers and practitioners to take suitable measures to overcome these barriers and fuel the adoption of blockchain in Indian SMEs.	blockchain technology;supply chain finance;sme;barriers;fuzzy-ahp;fuzzy-dematel;sensitivity analysisfuzzy-ahp;selection;technology;achieve;challenges;logistics;resources;framework;sense
795	虚拟经济	Comparative Research on the Game Behavior of the Participants in the Traditional Supply Chain Finance and the Supply Chain Finance on the Blockchain	The authors took the financing warehouse in supply chain finance as an example, used the game between capital providers (banks and their entrusted logistics supervision enterprises) and capital demanders (core enterprises of supply chain, upstream suppliers, and downstream dealers) as the research object, and constructed the income matrices, respectively, and the Nash equilibrium of pure decision and mixed decision was calculated. The authors compared the game behavior of the participants in the traditional supply chain finance and the supply chain finance on the blockchain and the difference of the mixed decision Nash equilibrium whether blockchain rewards and punishment were added. When the rewards and punishment were added to encourage the transaction information placing in the blockchain, the Nash equilibrium point would be further away from the origin point, and the capital provider and the capital demander would choose to cooperate with greater probability. When the cost of the blockchain is gradually reduced, the two sides of the game choose to place the transaction information in the chain, which can improve the cooperation of the participants of the supply chain finance, and they can get more profit.	
796	实体经济	Blockchain Technology for Supply Chains operating in emerging markets: an empirical examination of technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework	Organizations adopt blockchain technologies to provide solutions that deliver transparency, traceability, trust, and security to their stakeholders. In a novel contribution to the literature, this study adopts the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to examine the technological, organizational, and environmental dimensions for adopting blockchain technology in supply chains. This represents a departure from prior studies which have adopted the technology acceptance model (TAM), technology readiness index (TRI), theory of planned behavior (TPB), united theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) models. Data was collected through a survey of 525 supply chain management professionals in India. The research model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results show that all the eleven TOE constructs, including relative advantage, trust, compatibility, security, firm's IT resources, higher authority support, firm size, monetary resources, rivalry pressure, business partner pressure, and regulatory pressure, had a significant influence on the decision of blockchain technology adoption in Indian supply chains. The findings of this study reveal that the role of blockchain technology adoption in supply chains may significantly improve firm performance improving transparency, trust and security for stakeholders within the supply chain. Further, this research framework contributes to the theoretical advancement of the existing body of knowledge in blockchain technology adoption studies.	blockchain technologies;technological perspective;organizational perspective;environmental perspective;structural equation modelingcloud computing adoption;user acceptance;information-technology;e-commerce;determinants;impact;smes;sem;challenges;services
797	实体经济	A Study on the Adoption of Blockchain for IoT Devices in Supply Chain	The integration of blockchain and IoT enables promising solutions in decentralized environments in contrast with centralized systems. The blockchain brings forth features such as fault tolerance, security, and transparency of the data in IoT devices. As there is requirement of consensus among the network nodes to agree on a single-state-of-ledger, nonetheless, the extensive computational requirement for the consensus protocol becomes a limitation in resource-constrained IoT devices with limited battery, computation, and communication capabilities. This study proposes an empirical approach on the adoption of blockchain in a supply chain environment. Furthermore, a modified version of the Raft consensus protocol is proposed for use in supply-chain environment on the permissioned blockchain Hyperledger. In Raft consensus protocol, each transaction is directed to the leader node that transmits it to the follower nodes, making the leader node the bottleneck thus inhibiting the scalability and throughput of the system. This also results in high latency for the network. The modified RAFT consensus protocol (mRAFT) is based on the idea of utilizing the idle follower nodes in disseminating the vote requests and log replication messages. A detailed empirical evaluation of the solution built on Hyperledger Caliper is performed to demonstrate the applicability of the system. The improved workload division on the peers boosts the throughput and latency of the system in ordering service that enhances the overall efficiency of the system.	smart contracts;consensus;internet

Based on the blockchain platform, this paper designs the framework model of cloud storage and designs the cloud storage model based on homomorphic encryption based on the operation process of the model. According to the applicability of underlying blockchain storage, the HElib library is established as the algorithm for data privacy protection. The BGV homomorphic encryption algorithm is used as the bottom layer of the algorithm, and the efficiency of the BGV homomorphic encryption algorithm is compared with that of the Gentry's bootstrap-based homomorphic encryption algorithm. It is proved that the BGV algorithm is more suitable for big data.	
799	协同技术	Edge Computing and Blockchain in Enterprise Performance and Venture Capital Management	Aiming at improving the enterprise performance and venture capital management, the edge computing is combined with blockchain technology in the construction of the supply chains so as to improve the stability and security of raw material supply chains of venture capital enterprises. Firstly, the relationships among venture capital, enterprise performance, and supply chain integration are analyzed, and the positive impacts of optimization and innovation of supply chain technology and venture capital on enterprise performance improvement are discussed. Secondly, the edge computing and blockchain technology are adopted to optimize the supply chain, and a protocol model is established to improve the security of supply chain information transmission. In addition, the supply chain Internet of Things (IoT) system is designed in layers based on blockchain and edge computing technology. Finally, the designed protocol model is applied to the supply chain and the supplier performance is evaluated by using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). The results show that the gas value of the designed protocol model is stable at 104,000 similar to 116,000 in blockchain transactions, and the execution time of a single blockchain transaction fluctuates between 4,300 and 6,100 ms. Therefore, the designed protocol model can effectively ensure the security of supply chain data during the transmission. The evaluation results of supplier performance suggest that the cooperative relationship between venture capital enterprises and suppliers is affected by many factors. Optimizing the supply chain structure and production activities can improve the performance of suppliers and venture capital enterprises. This work provides a reference for analyzing the performance of blockchain technology on venture capital enterprises and suppliers.	entrepreneurship;innovation
800	实体经济	Governing the Digital Economy: An Exploration of Blockchains with Chinese Characteristics	In 2019 President Xi Jinping called for the prioritisation of blockchain technology as part of China's next phase of development. In China, blockchain technologies have been experimentally deployed in various areas including court records, securities exchanges, finance, and food supply chains. The emergence of blockchain as a governmental technology raises numerous questions, including: (i) what are the conditions of emergence and existence of China's interest in blockchain technology? (ii) what are the features of "blockchains with Chinese characteristics"? (iii) what implications are there for the post-COVID-19 pandemic world, in which technological issues are likely to be pivotal points of contention? This article seeks to examine these questions and frame a research programme that can shed light on how blockchains may impact the evolution and shape of China's social and economic structure and the interaction of China with the rest of the world, including the prospect of "decoupling" and "deglobalisation." Examples of blockchain innovation are drawn from food and pharmaceutical supply chains, the Healthy China 2030 policy, the digital RMB/Yuan and the Belt and Road Initiative with attention to the emerging legal and institutional frames that support the application of blockchain technologies.	belt and road initiative;bio-politics;blockchain;china;digital yuan;rmb;supply chainshidden information;belt
801	实体经济	An optimized hybrid deep neural network architecture for intrusion detection in real-time IoT networks	The Internet-of-Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of things to the physical network that is embedded with software, sensors, and other devices to exchange information from one device to the other. The interconnection of devices means there is the possibility of challenges like security, trustworthiness, reliability, confidentiality, and so on. To address those issues, we have proposed a novel GTBSS-HDNN approach which hybridization of Group theory (GT), Binary Spring search (BSS) algorithm, and Hybrid deep neural network (HDNN). The proposed GTBSS-HDNN approach effectively detects the intrusion in the IoT nodes. Initially, the privacy-preserving technology was implemented using a Blockchain-based methodology. Our proposed privacy-preserving methods are divided into two parts. The first stage utilizes blockchain and the second stage involves Modified Independent Component Algorithm (MICA) to prevent intrusion attacks. The authentication of data is performed by blockchain-based Enhanced Proof of Work (EPoW) and achieves better authentication. Furthermore, the experimental study is carried out using the ToN-IoT dataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of our proposed work. To analyze the performance we have taken the performance metrics such as F1-measure, Detection Rate, Precision, and Accuracy. The performance analyzes depict that the proposed method effectively preserves the accuracy and thereby avert the intrusion attacks. The proposed model achieved 95.3% accuracy, 96.54% precision, 95.23% recall, and 95.67% F-score values on the ToN-IoT dataset and 96.23% accuracy, 95.94% precision, 97.03% recall, and 96.70% F-score results on the BoT-IoT dataset.	blockchain;internet;algorithm;dataset;secure;things

In fact, research that addresses the strategic approach to planning, coordinating, and executing the cashless adoption and experience for consumers is scant. To stimulate discussion and scholarly investigations into marketing's contribution toward the evolution of cashless economies, this Idea Corner presents a research agenda that delineates the role of DPS 2.0, a new era of digital payment systems, in fueling the demonetization process.

However, the promise of DPS 2.0 is clouded with concerns of opportunism, security, and fraud.

805	协同技术	A survey on security in internet of things with a focus on the impact of emerging technologies	Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power, memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of securely connected things to the "internet of insecure things." A promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the hardware of the IoT device. The integration of emerging technologies in IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.	iot;security;machine learning;blockchain;threats;security solutionslightweight cryptography;intrusion detection;iot-devices;attacks;threats;authentication;challenges;blockchain

807	实体经济	Data envelopment analysis models based on decentralized decision making	Information technologies, such as blockchain, have promoted the development of decentralized decision-making in complex systems and generated many decentralized autonomous organizations. We construct a set of decentralized Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models based on the basic decentralized decision mode of "voting majority", and we consider the assumptions that DMUs have no prior information about other DMUs' decisions, and that they do. Then, the process of decision-making for each decision making unit (DMU) can be viewed as a social behavior over multiple time periods. Using a numerical example, we demonstrate that the new DEA models can provide acceptable efficiency results with specific weights for each DMU and can describe the details of the consensus relationship among DMUs. Similar to the market mechanism in reality, the efficiency scores of DMUs within an alliance containing more than half of the participants are overestimated, at the expense of nonallied DMUs. The models in this paper provide a possible path for efficiency measurement based on decentralized decision-making principles in complex systems.	data envelopment analysis;decentralized decision-making;decentralized dea;voting majoritycross-efficiency;dea
808	实体经济	Certificateless linkable ring signature-based blockchains for securing cognitive radio networks	Rapid advancement in industrial applications of Internet of Things (IoT) has dramatically increased the number of Internet connected devices resulting in big challenges of scalability, adaptability, connectivity, and accessibility. Cognitive radio is efficient in handling spectrum allocation problem by facilitating the allocation of unlicensed spectrum dynamically to the IoT applications. However, cognitive radio network (CRN) capability of spectrum sensing is highly vulnerable to diversified number of security attacks. Malicious user disturbs the spectrum sensing potential and minimizes its accuracy by launching attacks during the detection of primary signal. In this article, certificateless linkable ring signature-based blockchains (CLRSB) is proposed for securing CRNs by achieving reliable discrimination between trustworthy users through cryptographic keys. It initially transformed the complete set of users such as PUs and SUs into the structure of blocks representing the smart contracts-based traditional public ledger blockchain that gets integrated to form a decentralized network for attaining improvement in efficient spectrum sensing. It adopted a mayfly optimization algorithm (MFOA)-improved CNN (MFOA-ICNN)-based spectrum sensing method for preventing the interference between PUs and SUs during spectrum access. It also used MFOA for optimizing the features with balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation to identify the remarkable features that attributes toward efficient spectrum sensing. It specifically used CLRS for protecting information about the transaction initiator for the objective of protecting blockchain privacy. Simulation experiments of this CLRSB confirmed better response time and minimized frame loss on an average by 18.13% and 17.81%, better than the baseline schemes used for investigation.	blockchain;certificateless linkable ring signature;cognitive radio networks;internet of things;malicious users;spectrum sensingattacks;defense;game
809	市场治理	To learn or not to learn? Evaluating autonomous, adaptive, automated traders in cryptocurrencies financial bubbles	Financial bubbles represent a severe problem for investors. In particular, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed the bursting of different bubbles in the last decade, which in turn have had spillovers on all the markets and real economies of countries. These kinds of markets and their unique characteristics are of great interest to researchers. Generally, investors and financial operators study market trends to understand when bubbles might occur using technical analysis tools. Such tools, which have been historically used, resulted in being precious allies at the basis of more advanced systems. In this regard, different autonomous, adaptive and automated trading agents have been introduced in the literature to study several kinds of markets. Among these, we can distinguish between agents with Zero/Minimal Intelligence (ZI/MI) and Computational Intelligence (CI)-based agents. The first ones typically trade on the market without resorting to complex learning strategies; the second ones usually use (deep) reinforcement learning mechanisms. However, these trading agents have never been tested on the cryptocurrencies market and related financial bubbles, which are still mostly overlooked in the literature. It is unclear how these agents can make profits/losses before, during, and after a bubble to adjust their strategy and avoid critical situations. This paper compares a broad set of trading agents (between ZI/MI and CI ones) and evaluates them with well-known financial indicators (e.g., volatility, returns Sharpe ratio, drawdown, Sortino and Omega ratio). Among the experiment's outcomes, ZI/MI agents were more explainable than CI ones. Based on the results obtained above, we introduce GGSMZ, a trading agent relying on a neuro-fuzzy mechanism. The neuro-fuzzy system is able to learn from the trades performed by the agents adopted in the previous stage. GGSMZ's performances overcome those of other tested agents. We argue that GGSMZ could be used by investors as a decision support tool.	zero-intelligence trader;reinforcement learning trader;cryptocurrency;financial bubbleszero-intelligence;sentiment analysis;price formation;market;efficiency
810	实体经济	Exploring the use of self-sovereign identity for event ticketing systems	Ticket fraud and ticket scalping activities often cause high costs as well as trust concerns for fans buying event tickets, especially in the secondary ticketing market. To address these issues, several publications and projects have proposed using blockchain technology to enable digital trust and ticket verifiability and thus to improve event ticketing systems. However, these approaches exhibit considerable privacy challenges and fall short concerning reliable, efficient visitor identification, which is necessary for controlling secondary market transactions. We demonstrate how a novel paradigm for end-user digital identity management, called self-sovereign identity (SSI), can be utilized to gain secondary market control. To do so, we follow a rigorous design science research approach to build and evaluate an SSI-based event ticketing framework. Our findings demonstrate that SSI-based event ticketing can enable efficient secondary market control by facilitating a practical implementation of the centralized exchange model. To generalize our results, we derive design principles for the efficient, reliable, and privacy-oriented ticket and identity verification and the use of revocation registries.	bot prevention;digital identity management;digital wallet;secondary market control;ticket scalping;verifiable credentialsdesign science research;anonymity
811	实体经济	Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Residential Prosumers With Photovoltaic and Battery Storage Systems	The popularization of solar generation enables residential households to supply their loads and trade the surplus energy through residential peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading market. Facing the increasing complexity of the market structure and decision-making strategies, this article proposes a P2P energy trading model for residential households, and the objective is to help the centralized market coordinator optimize the benefit of participants under such a P2P market. To this end, a new mathematical model, including the rules for buying and selling energy, is presented. In this model, a supply function bidding mechanism is formulated to match the power supply imbalance and calculate the market-clearing price. An optimization problem is formulated to identify the optimal strategies for energy buying and selling, which consists of two parts: the first part is to maximize the social welfare; the second part is to minimize the unfair benefit distribution that participants can gain through P2P energy trading. The case study based on the real data for four different household categories has revealed that households can achieve 26.38% net cost reduction, and the proposed fair benefit distribution function also can fairly allocate the benefit by enforcing households' benefit variance indexes at a low level.	costs;optimization;companies;batteries;statistics;sociology;peer-to-peer computing;battery energy storage system;peer-to-peer (p2p) energy trading;residential;smart grid;supply function biddinggeneration;management;blockchain;market;solar
812	协同技术	When Federated Learning Meets Blockchain: A New Distributed Learning Paradigm	Motivated by the increasingly powerful computing capabilities of end-user equipment, and by the growing privacy concerns over sharing sensitive raw data, a distributed machine learning paradigm known as federated learning (FL) has emerged. By training models locally at each client and aggregating learning models at a central server, FL has the capability to avoid sharing data directly, thereby reducing privacy leakage. However, the conventional FL framework relies heavily on a single central server, and it may fail if such a server behaves maliciously. To address this single point of failure, in this work, a blockchain-assisted decentralized FL framework is investigated, which can prevent malicious clients from poisoning the learning process, and thus provides a self-motivated and reliable learning environment for clients. In this framework, the model aggregation process is fully decentralized and the tasks of training for FL and mining for blockchain are integrated into each participant. Privacy and resource-allocation issues are further investigated in the proposed framework, and a critical and unique issue inherent in the proposed framework is disclosed. In particular, a lazy client can simply duplicate models shared by other clients to reap benefits without contributing its resources to FL. To address these issues, analytical and experimental results are provided to shed light on possible solutions, i.e., adding noise to achieve local differential privacy and using pseudo-noise (PN) sequences as watermarks to detect lazy clients.	
813	实体经济	SIoVChain: Time-Lock Contract Based Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in SIoV	Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) is an emerging technology in the smart city environment, enabling smart vehicles to form social groups and exchange data among themselves. SIoV facilitates many applications aiming to improve driving safety and traffic monitoring by sharing data among vehicles. It ensures a safe and comfortable drive. However, privacy, data confidentiality, and data integrity are the major challenges during multi-hop data transfer that must be addressed for the wide adoption of SIoV. The existing solutions do not provide anonymity and consume more network resources. To address these issues, we propose SIoVChain, a time-lock contract-based privacy-preserving data sharing scheme with incentives for SIoV. It does not only enable data sharing between vehicles anonymously but incentivizes them also. In addition, the proposed framework imposes a penalty anonymously if a malicious vehicle disseminates false information. SIoVChain is shown to be secure against stealing processing fee attack while preserving sender-receiver privacy and path privacy. Universal Composability (UC) framework is used to verify user privacy. The feasibility and efficiency of the scheme are also demonstrated.	blockchains;automobiles;data privacy;security;lightning;privacy;internet of vehicles;privacy;anonymity;data sharing;social internet of vehicles (siov);lightning network;blockchainauthentication
814	协同技术	Artificial intelligence based optimization with deep learning model for blockchain enabled intrusion detection in CPS environment	Cyber physical system (CPS) is a network of cyber and physical elements, which interact with one another in a feedback form. CPS approves critical infrastructure and is treated as essential in day to day since it forms the basis of futuristic smart devices. An increased usage of CPSs poses security as a challenging issue and intrusion detection systems (IDS) can be applied for the identification of network intrusions. The latest advancements in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) enables to design effective IDS models for the CPS environment. At the same time, metaheuristic algorithms can be employed as a feature selection approach in order to reduce the curse of dimensionality. With this motivation, this study develops a novel Poor and Rich Optimization with Deep Learning Model for Blockchain Enabled Intrusion Detection in CPS Environment, called PRO-DLBIDCPS technique. The proposed PRO-DLBIDCPS technique initially introduces an Adaptive Harmony Search Algorithm (AHSA) based feature selection technique for proper selection of feature subsets. For intrusion detection and classification, and attention based bi-directional gated recurrent neural network (ABi-GRNN) model is applied. In addition, the detection efficiency of the ABi-GRNN technique has been enhanced by the use of Poor and rich optimization (PRO) algorithm based hyperparameter optimizer, which resulted in enhanced intrusion detection results. Furthermore, blockchain technology is applied for enhancing security in the CPS environment. In order to demonstrate the enhanced outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique, a wide range of simulations was carried out on benchmark dataset and the results reported the better outcomes of the PRO-DLBIDCPS technique in terms of several measures.	classification
815	核心技术	Blockchain verification and validation: Techniques, challenges, and research directions	As blockchain technology is gaining popularity in industry and society, solutions for Verification and Validation (V&V) of blockchain-based software applications (BC-Apps) have started gaining equal attention. To ensure that BC-Apps are properly developed before deployment, it is paramount to apply systematic V&V to verify their functional and non-functional requirements. While existing research aims at addressing the challenges of engineering BC-Apps by providing testing techniques and tools, blockchain-based software development is still an emerging research discipline, and therefore, best practices and tools for the V&V of BC-Apps are not yet sufficiently developed. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on V&V solutions for BC-Apps. Specifically, using a layered approach, we synthesize V&V tools and techniques addressing different components at various layers of the BC-App stack, as well as across the whole stack. Next, we provide a discussion on the challenges associated with BC-App V&V, and summarize a set of future research directions based on the challenges and gaps identified in existing research work. Our study aims to highlight the importance of BC-App V&V and pave the way for a disciplined, testable, and verifiable BC development. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

816	核心技术	A probabilistic Proof-of-Stake protocol with fast confirmation	Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol is one of the most promising blockchain consensus protocols in the permissionless setting. However, there is a general problem of slow confirmation in PoS protocol. To address the issue, a small -sized committee in PoS protocol is used to reduce the costs in terms of communication and computation, and accelerate confirmation. Following this idea, a committee-based PoS protocol called LaKSA (NDSS'2021) is proposed recently.In this paper, we present a balance attack on LaKSA, and show LaKSA cannot satisfy the liveness property even in the synchronous network. To ensure security and improve efficiency, we propose a self-healing probabilistic PoS protocol with a small-sized committee and a fast confirmation. Specifically, we propose a three-phase broadcast finality gadget and two compatible confirmation rules. The participants can invoke the three-phase broadcast periodically and commit a block according to different confirmation rules. By our approaches, on the one hand, we can prevent the PoS protocol from the balance attack and keep it committing new blocks over time. On the other hand, it empowers the protocol an ability of self-healing, by which nodes can commit a block as quickly as possible instead of waiting for a long time. Furthermore, we prove that our protocol can achieve the security properties of probabilistic safety and liveness. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the self-healing protocol. The experimental results show that, compared with LaKSA protocol, our protocol improves the commit rate by about 30% with a high throughput under a poor network condition.	blockchain;consensus;proof-of-stakeattacks
817	实体经济	Blockchain technology and supply chains: The paradox of the atheoretical research discourse	Blockchain technology has seen increasingly important practical applications. The literature has expanded greatly in the past four to five years. One area that has seen significant application and growth is in supply chain management-which includes transportation and logistics. The growth of this literature has also resulted in several literature reviews-each has specific scope and emphasis. Of the growing number of literature review and bibliometric analysis studies, the focus has ranged from understanding application cases, themes, trends, and methodologies. Theoretical developments and theorizing have been limited for supply chain management in general and even more limited for sustainable supply chains. Arguably, much of the current research has been relatively atheoretical-a lack of theory development and theory application. Hence, we conclude the existing blockchain research discourse has been centered around application and less around the theory. As a sub-discipline, the nexus of blockchain and supply chain management is still in the early developmental stages. Using a critical synthesis review of the literature, this paper fo-cuses on the most popular theories that have been applied to explain blockchain adoption and implementation within supply chains-how each theory explains the motivations, formalizes the organizational process around the acceptance of blockchain technology, and predicts the out-comes of blockchain-supported business models. Current theoretical gaps and potential future theorizing are discussed. Potential theories that have been used for other technologies (i.e., the internet of things) which have not been applied to the blockchain context are provided and discussed. The comprehensive and systematic theory review has important theoretical and managerial implications for both academia by advancing multiple academic disciplines and practice with insights into actual acceptance and usage of blockchain and other disruptive technologies.	blockchaintechnology;supplychainmanagement;sustainability;theorybuilding;literaturereviewtransaction cost economics;acceptance model;management;logistics;collaboration;perspective;framework;insights;adoption
818	实体经济	Research on optimization of food supply chain considering product traceability recall and safety investment	Strict food regulations, high-quality product demand, and fierce market competition urge food enterprises to focus on the optimization strategy of product safety and traceability recall in the food chain. To better meet customers' safety and quality expectations and reduce the loss of problematic products that fail to be recalled in time, the paper establishes a two-level food supply chain consisting of a single manufacturer and supplier, uses the Stackelberg game to explore the interaction between traceability recall and product safety optimization in the food chain, and finds the best food safety investment and product traceability recall strategy. And we consider the case of the former investing in the latter's product safety efforts. The results show that the food safety premium sharing rate determines the optimal decision of manufacturers and suppliers when each member is faced with the difference between the loss cost of unrecalled food per unit and the traceable recall cost coefficient. In addition, the higher safety investment cost factor increases the burden on the entire supply chain and reduces the safety benefits of the food chain. Moreover, higher security investment cost factors increase the burden on the entire supply chain and reduce the safety benefits of the food chain. Interestingly, suppliers can take advantage of the increased cost per unit of unrecalled products to obtain higher safety investments when manufacturers implement recall measures for problematic foods. We also introduced blockchain technology and discovered Pareto optima for food safety. When the supplier bears part of the problem of food loss, food safety, quality, and investment are high. The conclusions show that product traceability recall is beneficial to the overall welfare of the food chain.	quality improvement;contract
819	核心技术	Scalable Blockchain Storage Model Based on DHT and IPFS	Blockchain is a distributed ledger that combines technologies such as cryptography, consensus mechanism, peer-to-peer transmission, and time stamping. The rapid development of blockchain has attracted attention from all walks of life, but storage scalability issues have hindered the application of blockchain. In this paper, a scalable blockchain storage model based on Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) was proposed. This paper introduces the current research status of the scalable blockchain storage model, as well as the basic principles of DHT and the InterPlanetary File System. The model construction and workflow are explained in detail. At the same time, the DHT network construction mechanism, block heat identification mechanism, new node initialization mechanism, and block data read and write mechanism in the model are described in detail. Experimental results show that this model can reduce the storage burden of nodes, and at the same time, the blockchain network can accommodate more local blocks under the same block height.	blockchain;dht;ipfs;storage optimization;storage scalability
820	协同技术	MobEdge: Mobile blockchain-based privacy-edge scheme for healthcare Internet of Things-based ecosystems	Centralized healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT)-based ecosystems are challenged by high latency, single-point failures, and privacy-based attacks due to data exchange over open channels. To address the challenges, the shift has progressed toward decentralized HIoT setups that infuse computation closer to a patient node via edge services. As HIoT data are critical and sensitive, trust among stakeholders is a prime concern. To address the challenges, researchers integrated blockchain (BCH) into edge-based HIoT models. However, the integration of lightweight BCH is required with an edge for proper interplay and leverage effective, scalable, and energy-efficient computational processes for constrained HIoT applications. Owing to the existing gap, this article proposes a scheme MobEdge, that fuses lightweight BCH, and edge computing to secure HIoT. A local BCH client model is set up that forwards data to edge sensor gateways. The shared data are secured through an access tree control lock scheme that preserves the privacy of health records. For security and signing purposes, we have considered signcryption, and the validated records meta-information are stored in an on-chain structure. The scheme is compared on two grounds, security and simulation grounds. On the security front, we do cost evaluation and present a formal analysis model using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications tool. An edge-based BCH setup use-case is presented, and parameters like mining cost, storage cost, edge servicing latency, energy consumption, BCH network usage, and transaction signing costs are considered. In the simulation, the mining cost is 0.6675 USD, and improvement of storage costs are improved by 18.34%, edge-servicing latency is 384 ms, and signcryption improves the signing cost by 36.78% against similar schemes, that indicates the scheme viability in HIoT setups.	edge computing;healthcare iot;mobile blockchain;privacy-preserving;signcryptionaccess-control;framework;security;model

Using unique individual data from the online art NFTs marketplace SuperRare, we combine econometric tools with recent machine learning approaches. This approach allows us to define explanatory variables out of the NFTs descriptions for our Hedonic pricing approach. Using these variables, we are able to show that our Hedonic pricing models exhibit relevant informational value for NFTs prices. Moreover, we show that NFTs cannot be viewed as a simple derivative of cryptocurrencies.	digital art;non-fungible tokens;hedonic prices;lasso regression

Ballot is basically a piece of paper that is used to cast vote during election. In ballot paper voting system each voter uses a ballot paper which is not shared and basically it is a paper printed with the name and symbols of the candidates. The Electronic Voting Machine is basically a memory recorder which records the vote casted by the voters. In this paper, main advantages of E-voting systems for country is highlighted. For constructing E-voting systems, every countries need to do great attention to Verification and Validation requirements. In this research, E-voting scheme with face recognition using deep learning technique is proposed. The process of casting vote is accomplished by blockchain technology and blind signature mechanism.

823	协同技术	Achieving Security in Proof-of-Proof Protocol with Non-Zero Synchronization Time	Among the most significant problems that almost any blockchain faces are the problems of increasing its throughput (i.e., the number of transactions per unit of time) and the problem of a long waiting time before block confirmation. Thus, for example, in the most common BTC blockchain, according to various estimates, throughput is from 3 to 7 tps (transactions per second), and the average block confirmation time (block is considered confirmed if it has at least 6 blocks over it) is 1 h. At the same time, it is impossible to solve these problems directly by increasing the block size or increasing block generation intensity because this leads to essentially a decrease in the security of the blockchain in the first turn against double spend and splitting attacks. Such problems lead to the inconvenience of the practical use of cryptocurrencies to pay for goods and services. Proposed a few years ago, the PoP consensus protocol potentially helps to solve the problem of increasing blockchain throughput, although it was originally intended to ensure the stability of "young" blockchains, with "small" PoW, through the use of a secure blockchain, such as BTC. A blockchain that has provable security is called the security-provided blockchain (SPB), and one that uses SPB to achieve its security is called the security-inherited blockchain. In this paper, we give explicit formulas which describe how the number of confirmation blocks in the security-inherited blockchain, which is sufficient to achieve a given security level of this blockchain to a double spend attack, depends on the parameters of both blockchains. It is essential that we use a realistic model to obtain the results, taking into account the synchronization times of both blockchains. Such a model is much closer to the real situation, but at the same time, it leads to significant analytical difficulties in obtaining results. The obtained formulas are convenient for numerical calculations, the numerous examples of which are also given in this work.	pop consensus;non-zero synchronization;blockchain security

Big data has been a game changer of machine learning. But, big data is a form of centralized version of data only available and accessible to the technology giants. A way to decentralize this data and make machine learning accessible to the smaller organizations is via the blockchain technology. This peer-to-peer network creates a common database accessible to those in the network. Furthermore, blockchain helps in securing the digital data and prevents data tampering due to human interactions. This technology keeps a constant track of the document in terms of creation, editing, etc., and makes this information accessible to all. It is a chain of data being distributed across many computers, with a database containing details about each transaction. This record helps in data security and prevents data modification. This technology also helps create big data from multiple sources of small data paving way for creating a well serving artificial intelligence model. Here in this manuscript, we discuss about the usage of blockchain, its current role in machine learning and challenges faced by it.	blockchain;artificial intelligence;big data management;cryptocurrency;permissionless;big blockchain network;permissioned blockchain
825	实体经济	Towards effective data sharing in ophthalmology: data standardization and data privacy	Purpose of review The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of updates in data standardization and data privacy in ophthalmology. These topics represent two key aspects of medical information sharing and are important knowledge areas given trends in data-driven healthcare. Recent findings Standardization and privacy can be seen as complementary aspects that pertain to data sharing. Standardization promotes the ease and efficacy through which data is shared. Privacy considerations ensure that data sharing is appropriate and sufficiently controlled. There is active development in both areas, including government regulations and common data models to advance standardization, and application of technologies such as blockchain and synthetic data to help tackle privacy issues. These advancements have seen use in ophthalmology, but there are areas where further work is required. Summary Information sharing is fundamental to both research and care delivery, and standardization/privacy are key constituent considerations. Therefore, widespread engagement with, and development of, data standardization and privacy ecosystems stand to offer great benefit to ophthalmology.	artificial intelligence;interoperability;ophthalmology;privacy;standardsartificial-intelligence;recommendations
826	实体经济	Blockchain assisted clustering with Intrusion Detection System for Industrial Internet of Things environment	Industry 4.0 has the potential to create new industrial revolution by offering intelligent, secure, independent, and self-adaptive Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. These IIoT nodes can be grouped via the clustering process into clusters to enhance networks' efficiency, lifetime, and scalability. However, it offers several benefits but still security is a primary concern, which can be resolved by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and blockchain technology. Therefore, an effective Blockchain-Assisted Cluster-based Intrusion Detection System for IIoT, called the BAC-IDS technique has been devised. The proposed BAC-IDS model aims to cluster the IIoT devices for detecting the intrusions and enabling blockchain-based secure data transmission. BAC-IDS technique involves Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO)-based clustering technique to choose the Cluster Heads (CH) effectively and construct clusters accordingly. In addition, Chicken Swarm Optimization with Gated Recurrent Unit-based intrusion detection is also followed to determine the presence of intrusions in IIoT environment. Moreover, blockchain technology enables secure data transmission from Cluster Members (CMs) to CHs. The design of HHO clustering and CSO-based hyperparameter optimization for the IIoT environment represents the novelty of the proposed work. A wide range of simulations are performed under different aspects. From experimental results, it has been observed that the BAC-IDS approach has gained a TNR (99.97%), AUC (99.96%), precision (99.99%), recall (99.97%), accuracy (99.98%), F-score (99.98%) and error rate (0.03) on NSL-KDD2015 dataset. Further, on CICIDS 2017 dataset, it has obtained TNR (99.96%), AUC (99.98%), precision (99.96%), recall (99.98%), accuracy (99.97%), F-score (99.96%), and error rate (0.04). The experimental results highlight the supremacy of the proposed BAC-IDS technique over current state-of-art techniques.	industrial iot;clustering;intrusion detection system;deep learning;blockchain;cluster headsframework;context
827	协同技术	A secure three-factor authentication scheme for IoT environments	Today, many users' extensive use of the Internet of Things (IoT) has made authentication an inevitable issue in the IoT. The currently existing authentication methods are subjected to many challenges by various factors such as the limited resources, the lack of authorization, and the need for a light-weighted authentication process. Therefore, it is essential to provide a security framework and protect the users' privacy at the lowest cost. This paper proposes a three-factor-based authentication scheme, called defense-in-depth, for the IoT environments on the blockchain platform. The proposed protocol applies mutual authentication with user authorization using smart card registration on a private blockchain without the need for a trustable server. The use of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) and the analysis of the security of the proposed protocol using AVISPA tool, formal/informal security analysis altogether indicate that the proposed scheme is more secure and efficient in terms of computational and communications costs.

829	协同技术	A high performance two-layer consensus architecture for blockchain-based IoT systems	We describe a two-layer architecture suitable for wide area IoT systems that use blockchain technology. The lower layer is comprised of several clusters in which nodes are interconnected with a number of virtual overlays which allow multiple consensus rounds that validate incoming data blocks to proceed concurrently and without contention. Validated data blocks are then ordered by the upper layer cluster, a virtual cluster formed by nodes from lower layer clusters (one from each cluster), and linked in the replicated blockchain ledger. In each cluster, a modified Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) protocol is used to achieve consensus. The use of layered architecture, virtual overlays, and multiple-leader capability lead to increased resiliency to consensus leader misbehavior as well as performance improvement over traditional PBFT, which are confirmed through a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) model linked to an M/G/1 queuing model in a wide range of parameter values.	multi-layer architecture;internet-of-things;blockchain technology;pbft consensusinternet

Moreover, we propose an encryption technique to protect the proposed system from passive and active attacks. The proposed technique is a hybrid of Rivest Shamir Adleman and Advanced Encryption Standard-256 (AES-256+RSA). We use this hybrid approach to efficiently and secretly share the users' secret keys. To address the issues of high resource consumption and communication delay, we propose a cache memory technique for miner and controller nodes. In addition, we propose an authentication mechanism to remove malicious nodes from the system.

831	实体经济	Joint time scheduling and transaction fee selection in blockchain-based RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio network	In this paper, we develop a new framework called blockchain-and backscatter-aided Internet of Things (IoT) system. In the framework, IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a secondary gateway by using an RF-powered backscatter cognitive radio technology. The data collected at the gateway is then sent to a blockchain network for further verification, storage and processing. As such, the framework enables an IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage and maximize the energy efficiency. Moreover, the framework ensures that the data collected from the IoT devices is verified, stored and processed in a decentralized but in a trusted manner. To achieve the goal, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under dynamics of the primary channel, uncertainty of the IoT devices, and unpredictability of the blockchain environment. In the problem, the gateway jointly decides (i) time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and transmission time, among the IoT devices, (ii) the blockchain network, and (iii) a transaction fee rate to maximize the network throughput while minimizing the cost. To solve the stochastic optimization problem, we then propose to employ, evaluate, and assess a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm with Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (D3QN) to derive the optimal policy for the gateway. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed solution outperforms the conventional baseline approaches such as the conventional Q-Learning algorithm and non-learning algorithms in terms of network throughput and convergence speed. Furthermore, the proposed solution guarantees that the data is stored in the blockchain network at a reasonable cost.	cognitiveradio;ambientbackscatter;rfenergyharvesting;blockchain;timescheduling;deepreinforcementlearning;iot
832	实体经济	Data Governance Architecture of Digital Grid Based on Blockchain Technology and Nanomaterial Technology	As the traditional grid data architecture develops with enterprises, its security risks will become greater and greater, and it will not be able to satisfy customers' differentiated services. Predecessors' research on the application of blockchains and nanomaterials is still insufficient. To solve the various shortcomings of the traditional power grid data governance architecture, a new type of sensor designed using blockchain technology and nanomaterials is designed through new technical means. It is applicable to the current digital grid data management architecture. The study found that the scale of the system gradually increased from 4 nodes to 16 nodes, and the TPS entered the smoothing stage after about 10, 50, 70, and 100 s, and stabilized at a small fluctuation point. We found that for every 4 nodes increase in the cluster size, the throughput drops by about 8%. Clusters of different sizes have entered a state of stable throughput. Although TPS has shown an overall downward trend of 8%, the peak situation of TPS has shown a certain different trend. This shows that the digital grid data governance network framework designed through blockchain technology and nanomaterial technology can meet the various needs of modern digital grid data centers for data center networks, such as: business scalability, reliability, security, etc.	blockchain technology;nano material technology;digital grid;data architecturebanking;systems

834	市场治理	An Examination of Velocity and Initial Coin Offerings	Blockchain technology offers firms a novel method of raising capital via so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs). In the most common form of an ICO, a firm creates digital assets called "utility tokens" that are tracked on a blockchain-based ledger, requires that its product be purchased only with those tokens, and then, raises capital by selling these tokens to investors prior to creating any saleable product. (Some nonfungible tokens (NFTs) may function in a similar fashion.) We model a fundamental paradox with the use of ICOs involving utility tokens and similar structures. To increase capital raised by an ICO, the firm may attempt to reduce blockchain operating costs, thus expanding the quantity of goods sold. However, because of the mechanics of miner compensation, doing so increases the number of utility token transactions that take place in any time interval (i.e., increases token velocity and thus, the effective supply of tokens). By Fisher's equation, this lowers the dollar value of tokens and the amount investors are willing to pay for them. We show that this paradox limits the value of utility token ICOs as an alternative to traditional financing options. We discuss alternatives to and variations of utility tokens that can mitigate the conundrum and promote ICOs as a more viable form of financing.	blockchain;initial coin offerings;security token offerings;cryptoeconomics;utility token;equation of exchange;transactions costs;cryptocurrenciesinformation
835	市场治理	Estimating a model of herding behavior on social networks	In this paper, we estimate an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate herding behaviors in the formation of investor sentiment. We formalize a simple opinion dynamics model in a social network framework and rely on a numerical method to estimate its parameters. We derive a sentiment proxy from the weekly aggregation of online messages concerning 15 US stocks and 5 cryptocurrencies. Our empirical results suggest a strong impact of herding behavior on the formation of sentiment toward highly volatile assets. For such assets, we simultaneously find limited impacts of financial returns and investor attention on the opinion formation process, suggesting that investor sentiment is explained by social interactions. On the other hand, we find a limited influence of social interactions on sentiment regarding less volatile assets, whose formation process is instead explained by the strong influence of financial returns and investor attention. In particular, we find that herding behavior was significantly higher and played a major role in the sentiment formation process regarding cryptocurrencies when the bubble occurred.

We calculate cryptocurrency exposure to changes in the geopolitical risk index and document that coins with the lowest geopolitical beta outperform those with high geopolitical beta. Our findings suggest that risk-averse investors require additional compensation as motivation to hold cryptocurrencies with low and negative geopolitical betas, and they are willing to pay a premium for assets with high and positive geopolitical betas.

Supply chain finance firms, blockchain, and the COVID-19 pandemic	We investigate the impact of the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market value and trading volume of supply chain finance (SCF) firms. Using an event study, we observe a significant valuation loss and higher trading volume of SCF firms. However, blockchain-enabled SCF firms are protected from such valuation loss and volatility in trading. We find that higher research and development (R&D) and capital expenditures by firms prevent the loss. Moreover, the firm value of blockchain-enabled SCF firms is impacted by their membership in a blockchain consortium and progress in blockchain implementation. Investors' confidence in blockchain reduces the market uncertainty.	blockchain;covid-19;event study;pandemic;supply chain finance;trading volume;valuationtrade credit;market;risk;security;returns;event;announcements;initiatives;disruptions;performance
838	法律治理	Defining blockchain governance principles: A comprehensive framework	Blockchain eliminates the need for trusted third-party intermediaries in business by enabling decentralised architecture design in software applications. However, the vulnerabilities in on-chain autonomous decision-makings and cumbersome off-chain coordination lead to serious concerns about blockchain's ability to behave in a trustworthy and efficient way. Blockchain governance has received considerable attention to support the decision-making process during the use and evolution of blockchain. Nevertheless, the conventional governance frameworks do not apply to blockchain due to its distributed architecture and decentralised decision process. These inherent features lead to the absence of a clear source of authority in blockchain ecosystem. Currently, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the governance of blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive blockchain governance framework, which elucidates an integrated view of the degree of decentralisation, decision rights, incentives, accountability, ecosystem, and legal and ethical responsibilities. The above aspects are formulated as six high-level principles for blockchain governance. We demonstrate a qualitative analysis of the proposed framework, including case studies on five extant blockchain platforms, and comparison with existing blockchain governance frameworks. The results show that our proposed framework is feasible and applicable in a real-world context. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

839	实体经济	Circularity issues and blockchain technology in the auto industry	The integration of circular economy and Industry 4.0 components like blockchain technology results in a faster induction of 'circularity' and leads to new strategies on resource utilization, making the world more sustainable. It is a 'key-enabler' in meeting tomorrow's circularity challenges. Literature revealed research gaps in a yet unexplored area of how 'circularity' building gets impacted by blockchain, especially in the Indian auto sector. Moreover, the nonavailability of its evaluation tool also necessitated present research. The main objective was to explore, from the auto stakeholders' perception viewpoints, the potential of the application of blockchain technology with special reference to the issue of 'sustainability and circularity' in the Indian context. The study involved a literature search, building a new circular economy-based blockchain model for the auto industry, and, finally, a case study in which the hypotheses about circularity and blockchain technology nexus impacts on the Indian auto industry were structured and tested through a research instrument, designed and sent to 45 auto stakeholders for evaluation of the said nexus. The data analyzed through the Best-Worst method revealed the 'potential' (weight: 0.393) and 'application' (weight: 0.262) impacts on CE are the most important yardsticks. The proposed model appears to be more reliable and secure and might help the managers of auto firms in forging new circularity-based strategies to exploit I4.0 efficiently.	circular economy;industry 4;0;blockchain technology;auto industry;best worst methodsupply chain;management;economy
840	实体经济	Research on emergency distribution optimization of mobile power for electric vehicle in photovoltaic-energy storage-charging supply chain under the energy blockchain	As a representative of clean energy, photovoltaic is expected to become a major supplier of electricity in the future. The combination of electric vehicle (EV) battery and charging station provides a feasible way to promote the effective consumption of photovoltaic. However, the efficiency of mobile power supply is limited by information asymmetry and security problems, and it is urgent to optimize the distribution process. Firstly, the article introduces the energy blockchain to improve the security level of electricity transaction, and designs the photovoltaic-energy storage-charging supply chain. Secondly, based on the selected road network and the actual situation of EV mobile power emergency distribution, the distribution logistics network with 50 distribution points is built. Thirdly, taking the delivery time and comprehensive cost as objective functions, the mathematical model of emergency distribution route optimization for EV mobile power supply is established, and the adaptive NSGA-II algorithm is adopted for example analysis. Finally, the parameter variation of NSGA-II and comparison with two algorithms of GA and MOPSO are carried out to validate the feasibility and applicability of proposed method. The purpose of the research is to quickly and effectively select the optimal distribution route of mobile power supply from many roads by maximizing customer demands and reducing costs, so as to promote the photovoltaic consumption.

For this purpose, this paper provides significant new insights to assess effective approaches, opportunities, challenges and future potential capabilities for the development of energy systems and SDGs under on-going pandemic and in case of a future global crisis. The digital energy systems with Industry 4.0 (I4.0), which provide noteworthy solutions such as enhancing energy efficiency policy, providing clean, secure and efficient energy and achieving SDG targets, has been discussed and evaluated. Integration of the smart grid (SG) architecture with blockchain-Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies is also offered. Alongside the various discussions, short-term, mid-term and long-term plans have been suggested in determining the well-defined renewable energy development and SDGs targets, struggling with climate change, transition to a more sustainable energy future and reaching global net-zero emissions. To achieve SDGs and provide more strong and sustainable energy systems under the continuing pandemic and in case of potential risk of forthcoming global crisis, this paper reveals significant perceptions that inform politicians and legislators in performing successful policy decisions.	digital energy system;sustainable development goal;smart grid;blockchain technology;industry 4;0;covid-19control strategies;power-systems;generation;technologies;operation;capacity;covid-19;barriers;progress;sdgs
842	实体经济	Blockchain based energy trading scheme for vehicle-to-vehicle using decentralized identifiers	A blockchain-based energy trading system is a new paradigm of grid infrastructure, which allows that energy purchaser and seller can efficiently exchange the energy through two-way communication. However, because energy trading services are provided through public networks, these systems are vulnerable to potential security breaches. This paper proposed a privacy-preserving blockchain-based energy trading scheme for vehicle-to-vehicle to resolve the security issues of contemporary systems and provide secure energy trading services. The proposed scheme has high efficiency by applying decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials technologies because the records of energy trading are not stored on blockchain and blockchain is only utilized in the validation of users. After completing the energy trading, the vehicle issues a verifiable credential to the counterpart to prove the legitimacy of the transaction. We also perform informal and formal security analysis to demonstrate its security and achieve secure mutual authentication, confidentiality, and session key security. Furthermore, we implement AVISPA simulation to show that our scheme is resistant to man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. As a result, the proposed scheme can be used in distributed smart grid environments.	energy trading;decentralized identifier;blockchain;verifiable credentialauthentication protocol;secure;system;internet;design;peer
843	实体经济	Improving sustainability in the tourism industry through blockchain technology: Challenges and opportunities	The tourism industry is extremely important to the world economy; yet, the industry falls short when it comes to economic, social, and environmental issues. Blockchain as an information technology can be utilized to help solve these issues and establish sustainable tourism globally. However, the challenges to blockchain adoption in the tourism industry have not yet been examined systematically. The goal of this study, therefore, is three-fold: we first identify the challenges to blockchain using literature review and expert opinions. Then, we examine them using the proposed rough Interpretive Structural Modeling - Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication based on expert judgments. Finally, we link these challenges to diffusion of innovation theory. The results suggest that "lack of technical maturity" and "lack of interoperability" are the most important challenges of blockchain in the tourism industry. The findings of the study support macro- and micro-level decision-making in tourism industry's prospective applications of blockchain.	tourism industry;blockchain;diffusion of innovation;rough-ism;micmacfuzzy approach;innovation;diffusion;adoption;management;barriers;ism;framework;insights;systems
844	核心技术	A framework for automating deployment and evaluation of blockchain networks	A blockchain network is a distributed system established by mutually distrusting participants to operate a blockchain, enabling them to manage critical information such as account balances or asset ownership without a centralised third party. Blockchain network deployment and evaluation have become prevalent due to the emerging blockchain use cases by enterprises, governments, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which demand private blockchains rather than participating in public ones. A blockchain network architecture drives deployment and evaluation activities. Nevertheless, practitioners must learn and perform error-prone activities to transform architecture into a blockchain network and evaluate it. Therefore, it is beneficial to automate these activities so that practitioners can focus on the architecture design, a valuable and hard-to -automate activity. The key challenges of such an automation framework are keeping up with the advances in blockchain technologies and the increasing complexity of blockchain network architecture. This paper proposes NVAL, a software framework that implements a novel architecture-driven, community-supported approach to automate blockchain network deployment and evaluation. NVAL accepts blockchain network architecture as input. It supports complex multi-channel blockchain networks, an increasingly prevalent architecture for private blockchain. The framework keeps up with blockchain technologies by leveraging platform-specific automation programmes developed by a practitioner community via runtime composition to handle new networks. We evaluated NVAL with a case study and showed that the framework requires only seven automation programmes to deploy 65 blockchain networks with 12 diverse architectures and generate 295 evaluation datasets. Furthermore, it consumes only 95.5 ms to plan and orchestrate the deployment and evaluation, which is minuscule compared to the total time required for deploying and benchmarking a blockchain network.	blockchain;distributed ledger;deployment;evaluation;automation;framework
845	实体经济	Design of vehicle certification schemes in IoV based on blockchain	Because of a large number of vehicles in Internet of Vehicle(IoV), distributed nodes and complex driving environment, data security and certification speed are easily affected. Blockchain enables different devices that do not trust each other to work together, maintain the general state in the process of information dissemination and sharing, and protect the privacy of devices. However, at present, the speed of vehicle certification in IoV is slow, and the use of idle resources is not considered. To address this problem, this paper provides a blockchain-based vehicle identity verification scheme by using a hybrid identity code verification method to ensure the nodes in the network securely share information. Meanwhile, a task processing algorithm based on time window is proposed to optimize the utilization of idle resources. In addition, the method is evaluated by simulation experiment, and the designed scheme can reduce malicious behavior of a registered vehicle in the network, and can shorten the processing task delay.	blockchian;internet of vehicle (iov);certification mechanism;task assignmentdata-transmission;authentication scheme;secure;efficient;internet;management
846	实体经济	Balancing privacy and occupational safety and health in construction: A blockchain-enabled P-OSH deployment framework	It is an unfortunate fact that, in pursuing occupational safety and health (OSH), privacy as a core value is often traded away. Blockchain technology has unexplored potential in tackling this dilemma through its cryptography, decentralization, and consensus mechanisms. This research aims to develop a blockchain-enabled framework to balance privacy protection and advancement of OSH management by focusing on the construction industry. It does so by adopting design science research as the overall methodology, under which specific methods such as literature review, industrial engagement, brainstorming, cross-sectoral learning, case study, and prototyping and experiment are organized. Underpinning the framework is the principle that personal privacy data should be encrypted, classified, and safeguarded in decentralized repositories while non-sensitive safety behavior data should be readily accessible to enable OSH management. Based on the principle, a blockchain-enabled deployment framework of privacy protection in OSH management named P-OSH is proposed. Its functional layers and protocols are elaborated. Through a series of prototyping and experiments in a modular construction project case study, it is found out that the framework, with proper deployment, can be developed into an operable P-OSH system to minimize the risk of infringing workers' privacy without undermining OSH management. The major contributions of this research are: (a) highlighting the importance of privacy protection while pursuing OSH excellence; (b) devising an information channeling mechanism; and (c) developing a deployable P-OSH framework. The research lays a steppingstone for further studies and practical explorations that apply blockchain technology in OSH management without sacrificing privacy.	blockchain;occupational health and safety;privacy;consortium blockchain framework;construction workermanagement;technology
847	实体经济	Leveraging blockchain concepts as watermarkers of plastics for sustainable waste management in progressing circular economy	Blockchain-integrated waste management and circular economy are emergent concepts that target minimising waste generation and fluctuations of resource commodity. Blockchain can support a circular economy and green principles by enabling information transparency, reliability and automation. Redesigning plastics by molecular tagging is the way forward to ensure synthetic plastics are kept in an infinite loop and support closed-loop recycling. The involvement of major corporations in product development and blockchain-integrated closed-loop recycling has resulted in several successful green chemical approaches toward circular plastic economy projects. Government policies and legislations are progressively supporting plastic redesigning for improving the plastic circular economy. Nevertheless, a systematic approach is required in addressing blockchain technology and plastic redesigning to effectively leverage circular economy initiatives.	blockchain technology;plastic circular economy;waste management;sustainabilitytechnology;collection;polymers;challenges;efficient
848	实体经济	Integrated blockchain and internet of things in the food supply chain: Adoption barriers	Blockchain (BLC) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are two emerging technologies that have become popular among practitioners for improving the transparency, adaptability, and safety of any industry. This is especially critical for food security, as COVID-19 highlighted the vulnerability of food supply chain (FSC). However, Indian organizations are experiencing problems in implementing the integrated form of BLC-IoT due to limited knowledge and insufficient research. The current study aims to propose a conceptual framework to reduce the impact of adoption barriers against BLC-IoT in FSC. Thirteen key barriers were identified after a thorough literature review and consultation with experts. The relationship among barriers was established using Inter-pretive structural modeling (ISM) and Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) methods. The analysis shows that the lack of government regulation and workers' low competency significantly influence BLC-IoT adoption. The results also indicate the intricacy of decision-making by demonstrating that 9 of the 13 barriers were a part of the linkage cluster. The study outcome will help practitioners in developing and planning stra-tegies for effective adoption of BLC-IoT in FSC.	blockchain;decision-making trial andevaluation;laboratory;food supply chain;internet ofthings;interpretive structural modelingindustry 4.0;technology;iot;management;challenges;logistics
849	实体经济	Blockchain-Enabled supply chains: An application in fresh-cut flowers	Supply chains have often benefited from breakthroughs in information technology. Blockchain, in particular, is a recent technology that is promising to revolutionize the way supply chains are designed and operated. This paper proposes a framework to optimize the adoption of blockchain jointly with the design of the supply chain network. A new form of product differentiation is enabled through blockchain adoption where blockchain-certified products are sold at a premium price to a growing segment of customers. The proposed framework allows supply chain managers to monetize data which has traditionally been used to improve supply chain efficiency. The framework is evaluated using a realistic case study inspired by the global supply chain of fresh-cut flowers. The results show that by strategically using blockchain at certain locations in the supply chain network, significant cost savings are realized compared to fully deploying blockchain throughout the supply chain. These cost savings lead to increased demand, better consumer surplus, and higher supply chain profit. Furthermore, the proposed data-enabled product differentiation leads to fresher products in the market.	routing;supply chain network design;blockchain;fresh -cut flowersnetwork design;perishable products;information;system;formulation;operations
850	实体经济	Blockchain adoption in a supply chain system to combat counterfeiting	The ongoing boom in platform retailing has been accompanied by widespread counterfeiting. Blockchain technology has attracted much attention as a way to combat this practice. We consider a supply chain system consisting of one brand seller, one counterfeiter and one platform retailer and examine how blockchain adoption affects the decisions of firms in this system and the performance of the whole system. We show that the platform's use of blockchain reduces both products' selling price and increases the brand seller's demand while also increasing the counterfeiter's demand under certain conditions when a wholesale contract is adopted. Moreover, we find that blockchain technology could be an effective anticounterfeit tool but that the platform does not always use it, even if its implementation is costless. The platform is more willing to use blockchain when imitation good's quality is relatively low, and an agency contract can better incentivize the platform to deploy blockchain than a wholesale contract if the commission fee is large. Finally, consumer surplus and social welfare may decrease after the platform adopts blockchain, but the whole supply chain system can perform better through the platform's blockchain implementation if the imitation good's quality and consumers' trust in the platform are low.	supply chain system;blockchain technology;counterfeit;distribution contractstrategic analysis
851	实体经济	Blockchain as the "trust-building machine" for supply chain management	This paper aims to investigate the impact of blockchain application on trust levels in supply chains. Through the systematic review of the relevant literature, three dimensions of trust, i.e., the trustor-trustee perspective, forms of trust, and time orientation, are investigated. Our findings show that, first, there are three pairs of trustors and trustees involved in blockchain implementation: (a) the user and the blockchain, (b) two supply chain partners, and (c) the consumer/public and a supply chain unit. Second, the two forms of trust, namely cognition-based and institution-based trust, are likely to be enhanced by blockchain execution, while affect-based trust may not be directly impacted by the technology. Third, the presence of blockchain technology would facilitate swift trust-building between unknown supply chain partners under specific circumstances. Moreover, we also find contradicting assertions among scholars on the implications of blockchain for trust in supply chains. While some studies pointed out that blockchain will enable a trustless trusted scheme, others expected the reinforcement of interorganizational trust. To test these assertions, we develop the blockchain-entrusted supply chain models to present the three-step process of how trust is developed through the blockchain and diffused to supply chain partners and external stakeholders.	blockchain;trust;supply chain;systematic reviewtraceability system;technology;logistics;model;knowledge;distrust;science;design;scopus;view
852	元分析	Hyperledger for IoT: A Review of Reconstruction Diagrams Perspective	The convergence of blockchain with the internet of things (IoT) attracted widespread attention. Blockchain mainly solved the problem of secure storage and trusted transactions. The convergence of these two emerging technologies enhanced the security of smart services. However, there were some technical barriers to the deployment of practical IoT systems. In order to further promote the popularity and application of blockchain in the IoT, Hyperledger became the ideal technology to overcome these obstacles. In recent years, the mainstream application fields of IoT tried to carry out integration with Hyperledger to achieve high security, fine-grained privacy protection, real-time data flow, robustness, and other business requirements. However, there was a lack of literature review on this topic. This study obtained the latest related literature of Hyperledger in IoT from Web of Science, Wordlib, and EBSCO databases. To demonstrate more intuitive differences and provide a technology convergence process, this study proposes a reconstruction diagram analysis method. Reconstruction is the process of fusing the core design and the original architecture diagram in the literature and reconstructing the diagram so that it can show the core ideas of the literature. This approach aims to visualize the core ideas of the literature. Finally, this paper prospected and concluded by proposing four directions for future work, including a low-energy consensus algorithm, intelligent transaction validation, mixed on-chain and off-chain storage, and customized incentives.	internet of things (iot);hyperledger;blockchaindischarging trading scheme;of-things;blockchain;management;implementation;certification;mechanism;framework;internet;platform
853	虚拟经济	Metaverse Space Ecological Scene Design Based on Multimedia Digital Technology	Yuan cosmos is a virtual world linked and created by scientific and technological means, which is mapped and interacted with the real world, and a digital living space with a new social system. With the increasing popularity of data acquisition and production equipment, people are increasingly convenient to produce multimedia data such as images, graphics, audio, video, animation, and three-dimensional models. In addition to the rapid development of digital technology itself, the biological information technology related to digital technology also greatly promotes the emergence of the metauniverse. This paper aims to study the application of multimedia digital technology to the ecological scene design of metauniverse space, introduces the related concepts of metauniverse and multimedia digital technology, expounds the related methods of multimedia digital technology and neural network related algorithms, and then takes the three-dimensional simulation of the auditory system in the interactive multisensory simulation system of the constituent elements of metauniverse as an example. The mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) is used to simulate the auditory characteristics of the auditory periphery (cochlea) as the perceptual end of the model. A variety of bionic mechanisms are used in the model, such as designing the connection mode of neurons, learning state and release effect, and the regeneration mechanism of neurons. For the verification of the performance of the model, the speech sample database, including English words and phrases, is recorded and the speech content information recognized by the model by means of speech recognition is experimented. The experimental results show that, in terms of phrase accuracy, the DN-1 model improves 2.59% and the DN-2 model improves 2.77% compared with MFCC feature on the basis of mixed features. When only DBN features are used, the performance improvement rate of the developmental network model is small.	
854	技术治理	On-chain analysis-based detection of abnormal transaction amount on cryptocurrency exchanges	Cryptocurrency exchanges play an indispensable role in the cryptocurrency market. However, some exchanges are suspected to be involved in various abnormal or malicious behaviors while providing services to users, such as money laundering, wash trading and even running away. Besides, these behaviors are reported to be often accompanied by an anomalous increase in the transaction amount. Therefore, it is a topic worthy of study to detect whether the abnormal transaction amount occurs in the exchange and when it occurs. This paper uses web crawler tools to collect a relatively complete dataset of exchanges and then conducts a correlation analysis to obtain the most important factors that influence the transaction amount of different exchanges. Then, the prediction model of the influence of various factors on the transaction amount is obtained based on deep learning. The deviation between the predicting transaction amount and the actual transaction amount is calculated to provide a basis for abnormal transaction amount detection. Finally, through a case study on the detection results, some abnormal transaction amounts are related to policy changes and industry events, while the others are suspected to be related to illegal behaviors.

855	实体经济	Healthcare Applications Using Blockchain Technology: Motivations and Challenges	Blockchain technology is one of the most important inventions and creative advancements that play a crucial role in today's business world. Blockchain technology is heading in the direction of systematic innovation and revolution. It is a digital ledger of transactions, and every block contains information of transactions linked by cryptographic references. Every block covers information and maintains trust among people based on how far they are. Blockchain is a system used for storing data, and it ensures the security of the system. The resurgence in blockchain technology has encouraged scholars and specialists over the past couple of years to carefully examine new ways of implementing blockchain technology with a wide range in the domain of healthcare. This rapid increase in blockchain technology has generated many endless possibilities. In this article, we provide a review of blockchain technology in healthcare. We present a detailed introduction, history, technical information, and types of blockchain technology. Motivations behind this technology and top healthcare projects completed using this technology are also discussed. This article is classified into three groups based on blockchain applications with their use cases. The evaluation of medical care technologies and relevant applications based on blockchain technology, such as sharing electronic medical records, remote patient monitoring, and supply chain management, are also discussed. In revolutionizing the healthcare industry, we illustrate the potential of blockchain technology. We have also focused on identifying the limitations of previous approaches.

856	协同技术	Hierarchical blockchain structure for node authentication in IoT networks	Internet of Things (IoT) networks are large peer-to-peer networks of small devices that require a competent security system that is scalable and adaptable to the limited resources of the IoT devices. Node authentication is a crucial part of IoT security. The current authentication solutions require a centralized trusted party for authentication, which presents a single point of failure. Blockchain as a peer-to-peer network with decentralized authentication can provide a decentralized solution for node authentication. In existing literature, most blockchain applications in IoT are connected to existing blockchain networks by more computationally capable devices, thereby limiting their adaptability for IoT networks and presenting single point of failure problem. Considering the issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized structure for authentication by arranging the IoT devices into clusters based on their computational capability, energy reserve and their location. The devices in each cluster are authenticated by a hierarchical structure of interconnected blockchains. To reduce the processing load we introduced a consensus protocol based on verifying identity-based encryption key signature of the device and its related cluster. The proposed structure simulation has shown a reduction of the processor and memory load of IoT devices. Further testing using Docker container network and Raspberry Pi devices network has shown that the proposed blockchain structure and consensus algorithm have reduced computational load. The analysis of the structure security and performance shows it offers comprehensive security protection while being lightweight and scalable. (C) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

857	协同技术	Blockchain-envisioned access control for internet of things applications: a comprehensive survey and future directions	With rapid advancements in the technology, almost all the devices around are becoming smart and contribute to the Internet of Things (IoT) network. When a new IoT device is added to the network, it is important to verify the authenticity of the device before allowing it to communicate with the network. Hence, access control is a crucial security mechanism that allows only the authenticated node to become the part of the network. An access control mechanism also supports confidentiality, by establishing a session key that accomplishes secure communications in open public channels. Recently, blockchain has been implemented in access control protocols to provide a better security mechanism. The foundation of this survey article is laid on IoT, where a detailed description on IoT, its architecture and applications is provided. Further, various security challenges and issues, security attacks possible in IoT and their countermeasures are also provided. We emphasize on the blockchain technology and its evolution in IoT. A detailed description on existing consensus mechanisms and how blockchain can be used to overpower IoT vulnerabilities is highlighted. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive description on access control protocols. The protocols are classified into certificate-based, certificate-less and blockchain-based access control mechanisms for better understanding. We then elaborate on each use case like smart home, smart grid, health care and smart agriculture while describing access control mechanisms. The detailed description not only explains the implementation of the access mechanism, but also gives a wider vision on IoT applications. Next, a rigorous comparative analysis is performed to showcase the efficiency of all protocols in terms of computation and communication costs. Finally, we discuss open research issues and challenges in a blockchain-envisioned IoT network.	internet of things (iot);blockchain;access control;authentication;key agreement;securitykey agreement protocol;iot-enabled internet;control scheme;health-care;consensus algorithm;authentication protocol;security challenges;management-system;smart cities;attacks
858	实体经济	Distributed Consensus-Based Online Monitoring of Robot Swarms With Temporal Logic Specifications	In this letter, we develop a distributed consensus-based online monitoring framework for a robot swarm with a fixed graph structure. Each agent can monitor whether the swarm satisfies specifications given in the form of Swarm Signal Temporal Logic (SwarmSTL) formulas. SwarmSTL formulas describe temporal properties of swarm-level features represented by generalized moments (GMs), e.g., centroid and variance. To deal with measurement noise, we propose a generalized moment consensus algorithm (GMCA) with Kalman filter (KF), allowing each agent to estimate the GMs. Besides, we prove the convergence properties of the GMCA and derive an upper bound for the error between an agent's estimate of the GMs and the actual GMs. This upper bound is derived to be dependent on the maximal allowed velocity but independent of the agents' exact motion. A set of distributed monitoring rules for SwarmSTL formulas are proposed based on the estimation error bound. As a result, the agents can monitor the satisfaction of SwarmSTL formulas over swarm features during execution. The distributed monitoring framework is applied to a supply transportation example, where the efficacy of KF in the GMCA is also shown.	agent-based systems;planning;scheduling and coordination;sensor networks
859	实体经济	HyperNet: A conditional k-anonymous and censorship resistant decentralized hypermedia architecture	Nowadays, the vast majority of Internet services used to distribute hypermedia content follow a centralized model, which is highly dependent on servers and raises several quality and security concerns. Among other issues, this centralized model creates single points of failure, requires trust on providers to avoid censorship and personal data misuse, and results in a scenario where digital content tends to disappear or be inaccessible over time, for example, when a content creator stops maintaining a site or when the content is moved to another location. To improve this, it is necessary to replicate data and follow more distributed models. Nevertheless, current platforms to distribute content in this way, either do not offer an effective mechanism to maintain the privacy of their users or they offer full-anonymity, which contributes to the dissemination of content that goes beyond the law and moral standards of many users. This paper proposes a novel distributed architecture that enables hypermedia resource distribution ensuring censorship resistance and conditional k-anonymity. In the proposed system, users form groups to share hypermedia content where the anonymity of the publisher is preserved only if the publication follows a set of rules defined by the group. To this end, the proposed system uses threshold discernible ring signatures to enable conditional k-anonymity, the Ethereum blockchain platform to manage groups and user identities, and the InterPlanetary File System to store and share hypermedia resources in a distributed way. This document provides the design for the proposed architecture and protocols, it evaluates system risks and its security properties, and it discusses the proposal in general terms.	revocableprivacy;distributedsystems;hypermediadistribution;k-anonymity;ringsignatures;blockchain
860	市场治理	Effects of COVID-19 on cryptocurrency and emerging market connectedness: Empirical evidence from quantile, frequency, and lasso networks	We use time and frequency connectedness approaches based on network analysis to investigate the volatility connectedness among 27 emerging equity markets and seven high-capitalized cryptocurrencies. We estimate the network connectedness using the standard, quantile, frequency, and lasso VAR models for the pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic periods and daily data over the period from October 2, 2017 to May 20, 2022. The network connectedness estimates based on the several models used in this study indicate a growing risk spillover among and within the emerging market equities and the cryptocurrencies after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world. The frequency connectedness analysis shows that cryptocurrencies cannot be used as diversifiers for emerging stock markets in both the short and long-run. The empirical findings from the quantile VAR model reveal that the volatility connectedness in the tails is much stronger compared to the center of the distribution. It is also evident that Saudi Arabia, Thailand's stock markets, and USDT are the main risk transmitters at the 0.95-th quantile during the post-COVID period. Time-varying connectedness estimates confirm the substantial effect of COVID-19. Our study also shows that the spread of risk among these financial markets is global rather than regional, supporting cross-border structure and worldwide financial market integration. The findings suggest cryptocurrency and emerging market equity portfolios should be closely monitored during financial turmoil.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating a country's institutional EO allows entrepreneurs to understand how embedded the institution is within a certain technology (in this case blockchain technology), which in turn, signals to entrepreneurs longer-term havens in which to locate to develop and commercialize the technology.	entrepreneurs;institutions;institutional entrepreneurial orientation;blockchain;cryptocurrencymoderating role;performance;management;adoption;linking;focus
863	法律治理	Blockchain Initiatives for Tax Administration	A thriving body of literature discusses various legal issues related to blockchain. This literature often conflates the discussion about blockchain with cryptocurrency. But blockchain is not the same as cryptocurrency. Defined as a decentralized, immutable, peer-to-peer ledger technology, blockchain is a newly emerging data management system. The private sector and the public sector have all begun utilizing blockchain. Since more data is being processed remotely, and thus digitally, the evolution of blockchain is gaining stronger momentum. While scholarship on blockchain is growing, none of the current scholarship has considered the impact of blockchain on the tax sector. 'This Article extends the study of blockchain to tax administration, evaluates the feasibility of incorporating blockchain within existing tax administrations, and provides policymakers with criteria to consider and some recommended designs for blockchain. Blockchain can enhance the efficiency and transparency of tax administration through its ability to deliver reliable, real time information from many sources to a large audience. Further, a well-designed private consortium blockchain, evolved from the classic public blockchain, may effectively protect taxpayers' information. Potential areas that blockchain could enhance are payroll and withholding taxes, value added taxes, transfer pricing, and the sharing of information between federal, state, and local governments as well as foreign countries. This Article offers normative considerations for policymakers deliberating using blockchain initiatives for tax administration, such as the timeline, standardization, integration with other systems, limitations, and accompanying legislation to regulate the government and taxpayers' rights and privacy. Those implications may resonate with a broader audience beyond tax policymakers.	
864	实体经济	BTrust: A New Blockchain-Based Trust Management Protocol for Resource Sharing	The emergence of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies opened the possibility for building novel peer-to-peer (P2P) resource allocation and sharing models. However, the trustless nature of these P2P models creates the need for reliable and effective trust and reputation mechanisms to minimize the risk of accessing or interacting with malicious peers. Blockchain technology, which is renowned for ensuring trust in trustless environments, provides us with new mechanisms to overcome the weaknesses of the existing reputation and trust management protocols. This paper proposes BTrust, an innovative decentralized and modular trust management system based on blockchain technology for evaluating trust in large-scale P2P networks. To quantify and assess the trustworthiness of peers and identify malicious peers, BTrust introduces a multi-dimensional trust and reputation model to represent trust and reputation scores in a single value derived from multiple parameters with appropriate weightings. Other contributions of this paper include the combination of recommendation and evidence-based approaches into a single system to provide a reliable and versatile way to compute trust in the network, an optimized trustless bootstrapping process to select trustworthy peers among neighbour peers and an incentive mechanism to encourage truthful feedback. We implement and evaluate the BTrust protocol using simulations and show that BTrust is highly resilient to failures and robust against malicious nodes.	blockchain;trust management;smart contracts;feadback incentivisation;random walks;resources sharingreputation management;system
865	虚拟经济	Rain Drop Service and Biometric Verification Based Blockchain Technology for Securing the Bank Transactions from Cyber Crimes Using Weighted Fair Blockchain (WFB) Algorithm	Cybercrime is an online crime committing fraud, stealing identities, violating privacy or hacking the personal information. A high level of information security in banking can be attained through striving to achieve an integrity, confidentiality, availability, assurance, and accountability. This Pandemic situation (COVID-19) paved the way for the customers to avoid traditional ways of banking and adapt to digital transactions. This banking digitalization increases in the utilization of cashless transactions like digital money (Cryptocurrency). Cyber security is imperative to preserve sensitive information, therefore, Blockchain technology has been adapted to provide security. Transactions done via Blockchain are tested through every block, which makes transactions secure and helps the banking system to work faster. The proposed algorithm WFB is used to estimate the average queue rate and avoid unwanted block generation. Then the trapezoidal fuzzy technique optimizes the allocation of blocks. An objective of this investigation is to enhance the security in banking systems from Cybercrimes by verifying Rain Drop Service (RDS) and Fingerprint Biometric without the need of any central authority. Once the service is completed, the service is a dropout and the following new service will be provided (Hence the name RDS). For the strong authentication scheme to fight against bank fraud, RSA encryption technique has been implemented successfully. Therefore, Blockchain technology increases the need for cyber security as a part of design architecture which intends to detect the stemming attacks in real time instead of repairing the damage.	fingerprint biometric;rain drop service (rds);rsa encryption algorithm;sha-256;trapezoidal fuzzy technique;weighted fair blockchain (wfb)
866	核心技术	Consensus Algorithms on Appendable-Block Blockchains: Impact and Security Analysis	The Internet of Things (IoT) has been making people's lives more efficient and more comfortable in the past years, and it is expected to get even better. This improvement may benefit from the use of blockchain to enhance security, scalability, reliability and auditability. Recently, different blockchain architectures were proposed to provide a solution that is better suited for IoT scenarios. One of them, called appendable-block blockchains, proposed a data structure that allows to include transactions in blocks that were already inserted in the blockchain. This approach allows appendable-block blockchains to manage large amounts of data produced by IoT devices through decoupled and appendable data structures. Nevertheless, consensus algorithms can impact throughput and latency in scenarios with large amount of produced transactions, since IoT devices can produce data very quickly (milliseconds) while these data might take some time to be included in a block (seconds). Consequently, it is important to understand the behaviour of different consensus algorithms over appendabble-block blockchain in these type of scenarios. Therefore, we adapted the appendable-block blockchain to use and compare the impact of different consensus algorithms: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), witness-based, delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) and Proof-of-Work (PoW). The results show that both dBFT and PBFT can achieve fast consensus (< 150ms) in the context of appendable-block blockchains. We also present a discussion regarding attacks in each consensus algorithm to help one to choose the best solution (considering performance and security issues) for each scenario.	distributed ledgers;blockchain;consensus algorithms;internet of things;iotiot;internet;management
867	核心技术	Sustainable Smart Industry: A Secure and Energy Efficient Consensus Mechanism for Artificial Intelligence Enabled Industrial Internet of Things	In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been industrializing in various real-world applications, including smart industry and smart grids, to make human existence more reliable. An overwhelming volume of sensing data is produced from numerous sensor devices as the Industrial IoT (IIoT) becomes more industrialized. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a vital part in big data analyses as a powerful analytic tool that provides flexible and reliable information insights in real-time. However, there are some difficulties in designing and developing a useful big data analysis tool using machine learning, such as a centralized approach, security, privacy, resource limitations, and a lack of sufficient training data. On the other hand, Blockchain promotes a decentralized architecture for IIoT applications. It encourages the secure data exchange and resources among the various nodes of the IoT network, removing centralized control and overcoming the industry's current challenges. Our proposed approach goal is to design and implement a consensus mechanism that incorporates Blockchain and AI to allow successful big data analysis. This work presents an improved Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) algorithm-based IIoT network that combines Blockchain and AI for real-time data transmission. To accelerate IIoT block generation, nodes use an improved DPoS to reach a consensus for selecting delegates and store block information in the trading node. The proposed approach is evaluated regarding energy consumption and transaction efficiency compared with the exciting consensus mechanism. The evaluation results reveal that the proposed consensus algorithm reduces energy consumption and addresses current security issues.	big data analytics;challenges;systems;information;impact
868	核心技术	Autoencoder based Consensus Mechanism for Blockchain-enabled Industrial Internet of Things	Conventional blockchain technologies developed for cryptocurrency applications involve complex consensus algorithms which are not suitable for resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Therefore, several lightweight consensus mechanisms that are suitable for IoT devices have been proposed in recent studies. However, these lightweight consensus mechanisms do not verify the originality of the data generated by the IoT devices, so false and anomalous data may pass through and be stored in the ledger for further analysis. In this work to address the data originality verification problem, we propose an autoencoder (AE)-integrated Chaincode (CC)-based consensus mechanism in which the AE differentiates normal data from anomalous data. The AE is invoked through the CC once a transaction is initiated; the result returned from the AE to the CC is stored in the ledger. We have conducted a case study to train and test the AE model on the IoTID20 dataset. Also, Minifabric (MF) is used to implement the CC and illustrate the CC operation that stores only original IoT data. Moreover, the performance has been shown for the CC in terms of latency and throughput.	iot;autoencoder;blockchain;hyperledger;security
869	实体经济	EBDF: The enterprise blockchain design framework and its application to an e-Procurement ecosystem	Blockchain technologies have seen a steady growth in interest from industries as the technology is gaining maturity. It is offering a novel way to establish trust amongst multiple stakeholders without relying or trusting centralised authorities. While its use as a decentralised store of value has been validated through the emergence of cryptocurrencies, its use case in industrial applications with multiple stakeholder ecosystems such as industrial supply chain management, is still at an early stage of design and experimentation where private blockchains are used as opposed to public blockchains. Many enterprise blockchain projects failed to gain traction after initial launches, due to inefficient design, lack of incentives to all stakeholders or simply because the use of blockchain was not really necessary in the first place. There has been a need for a framework that allows blockchain designers and researchers to evaluate scenarios when a blockchain solution is useful and design the key configurations for an enterprise blockchain solution. Literature on blockchain architectures are sparse and only applicable to specific use cases or functionalities. This paper proposes a comprehensive Enterprise Blockchain Design Framework (EBDF), that not only identifies the relevant use cases when a blockchain must be utilised, but also details all the characteristics and configurations for designing an enterprise blockchain ecosystem, applicable to multiple industries. To validate the EBDF, we apply the same to the Vortal e-Procurement ecosystem allowing for multiple platforms to interoperate with greater transparency and accountability over the proposed blockchain framework. In this use case, many vendors bid for procurement procedures, often for publicly managed funds where it is extremely vital that full transparency and accountability is ensured in the entire process. Ensuring that certain digital certification functions, such as timestamps are independent from e-Procurement platform owners has been a challenge. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for not only ensuring transparency and immutability of records, but also providing for interoperability across different platforms by acting as a trusted third-party. The applied framework is used to design a Hyperledger based blockchain solution with some of the key architectural elements that could fulfil these needs while presenting the advantages of such a solution.	blockchain applicability;blockchain architecture framework;consensus mechanism;blockchain platforms;e -procurement platform;hyperledger fabricnetworks;iot
870	协同技术	Blockchain-Cloud Integration: A Survey	Over the last couple of years, Blockchain technology has emerged as a game-changer for various industry domains, ranging from FinTech and the supply chain to healthcare and education, thereby enabling them to meet the competitive market demands and end-user requirements. Blockchain technology gained its popularity after the massive success of Bitcoin, of which it constitutes the backbone technology. While blockchain is still emerging and finding its foothold across domains, Cloud computing is comparatively well defined and established. Organizations such as Amazon, IBM, Google, and Microsoft have extensively invested in Cloud and continue to provide a plethora of related services to a wide range of customers. The pay-per-use policy and easy access to resources are some of the biggest advantages of Cloud, but it continues to face challenges like data security, compliance, interoperability, and data management. In this article, we present the advantages of integrating Cloud and blockchain technology along with applications of Blockchain-as-a-Service. The article presents itself with a detailed survey illustrating recent works combining the amalgamation of both technologies. The survey also talks about blockchain-cloud services being offered by existing Cloud Service providers.	blockchain;cloud computing;decentralization;blockchain-as-a-servicehealth-care;data-security;smart cities;architecture;internet;things;management;scheme;challenges;framework
871	实体经济	BIoMT: A State-of-the-Art Consortium Serverless Network Architecture for Healthcare System Using Blockchain Smart Contracts	Owing to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, the aforementioned approach to transferring patient data to central servers creates serious security and privacy issues. In addition, blockchain distributed ledger technology has introduced immutable storage and decentralized data management capability, which handles a large number of distributed nodes of E-Healthcare transactions via a serverless network, but in a limited manner because of blockchain-enabled resources. In this scenario, the medical industries are concerned about constituting an innovation in health information preservation and exchanging service delivery protocols without the connectivity of an untrusted third-party infrastructure. In this study, we proposed a blockchain hyperledger fabric-enabled consortium architecture called BIoMT, which provides security, integrity, transparency, and provenance to health-related transactions and exchanges sensitive clinical information in a serverless peer-to-peer (P2P) secure network environment. A consensus is designed and created to reduce the rate of blockchain resource constraints on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The privacy of individual health transactions before sharing is protected using the NuCypher Re-Encryption mechanism, which increases security and provides medical ledger integrity and transparency. Smart contracts are created and deployed to automate device registration, exchange transactions, and ledger preservation in immutable storage (filecoin) after cross verification and validation. The experimental results show that the proposed BIoMT reduces the computational cost by 26.13%, and the robust medical node generation increases to 60.37%. Thus, only 31.79% and 74.21% of IoMT-related information and serverless P2P network usage are maintained and saved, respectively.	blockchains;security;privacy;distributed ledger;medical services;computer architecture;peer-to-peer computing;blockchain hyperledger fabric;smart contract;e-healthcare;privacy and security;internet of medical things (iomt);consortium network
872	实体经济	A blockchain-based framework to support pharmacogenetic data sharing	The successful implementation of pharmacogenetics (PGx) into clinical practice requires patient genomic data to be shared between stakeholders in multiple settings. This creates a number of barriers to widespread adoption of PGx, including privacy concerns related to the storage and movement of identifiable genomic data. Informatic solutions that support secure and equitable data access for genomic data are therefore important to PGx. Here we propose a methodology that uses smart contracts implemented on a blockchain-based framework, PGxChain, to address this issue. The design requirements for PGxChain were identified through a systematic literature review, identifying technical challenges and barriers impeding the clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics. These requirements included security and privacy, accessibility, interoperability, traceability and legal compliance. A proof-of-concept implementation based on Ethereum was then developed that met the design requirements. PGxChain's performance was examined using Hyperledger Caliper for latency, throughput, and transaction success rate. The findings clearly indicate that blockchain technology offers considerable potential to advance pharmacogenetic data sharing, particularly with regard to PGx data security and privacy, large-scale accessibility of PGx data, PGx data interoperability between multiple health care providers and compliance with data-sharing laws and regulations.	implementation consortium guidelines;clinical implementation;precision medicine;care. data;challenges;genotype;barriers;physicians;patient
873	实体经济	BlockMedCare: A healthcare system based on IoT, Blockchain and IPFS for data management security	Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods. (C) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

874	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based Authentication Scheme for 5G-Enabled IoT	5G cellular network is becoming a preferred technology for communication in deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, 5G cellular network is essentially designed for cellular communication. Therefore, there are several areas in IoT over 5G cellular network, where there is scope for further improvement. One such area is development of efficient security mechanisms for authentication of the IoT devices. The authentication protocol currently being used in 5G cellular network maintains the security credentials of the devices at the home network in a centralised manner. Therefore, every time a device needs to be authenticated, the home network has to be communicated. However, considering the IoT scenario where there is large scale deployment of devices, frequent communication with the home network may result in increased communication latency. In this paper, we propose an authentication scheme where security credentials of the IoT devices are stored in a decentralized way using blockchain technology. The scheme is found to be safe and secured, through an informal and a formal security analysis using scyther tool. The smart contracts used in the scheme, when deployed in the ethereum test network, are also found to be efficient. Through experimental performance analysis, the scheme is found to have attained reduced communication latency compared to the existing protocols.	internet of things;5g cellular network;blockchain;authentication;communication latencychallenges;internet
875	协同技术	An Internet of Things (IoT) Based Block Chain Technology to Enhance the Quality of Supply Chain Management (SCM)	Recent technological developments indicate possible advancements in supply chain management (SCM). These innovations have attracted a lot of interest from industries including logistics, manufacturing, packaging, and transportation. The conventional systems, however, use centralised servers to control all operations, including the exchange of raw materials, making orders, dealing with buyers and sellers, and updating orders. The network's supply chain may thus be insecure as a result of every activity being routed via centralised servers. The danger is additionally increased by a number of difficulties, including scalability, data integrity, security, and availability. Block chain technology may be used in these circumstances to decentralise transaction processing and eliminate the need for a centralised controller. In this approach, the performance of the resource-constrained supply chain network is improved by the effective use of edge computing and priority data access. The Intelligent K-Means (IKM) clustering algorithm is suggested across the edge nodes in the current research to categorise the priority level of each piece of data. This classifier determines if the edge node has received data that is high priority or low priority. Low priority data is recorded in the log files for future data analysis. Then, to allow safe data flow in the open block chain while excluding outside parties, the High Priority Access based Smart Contract (HPASC) technique is deployed. The whole experiment was conducted in a Python environment, and variables including scalability, reaction time, throughput, and accuracy were studied. Current systems' constrained block sizes and fork creation lengthen the time transactions must wait before being processed. The suggested methodology is quicker and uses less storage space than current block chain systems. The results show that the suggested approach works better than current blockchain technology to raise the standard of supply chain management.	food
876	市场治理	Cryptocurrencies, currency competition, and the impossible trinity	We analyze a two-country economy with complete markets, featuring two national currencies as well as a global (crypto)currency. If the global currency is used in both countries, the na-tional nominal interest rates must be equal and the exchange rate between the national cur-rencies is a risk-adjusted martingale. Deviation from interest rate equality implies the risk of approaching the zero lower bound or the abandonment of the national currency. We call this result Crypto-Enforced Monetary Policy Synchronization (CEMPS). If the global currency is backed by interest-bearing assets, additional and tight restrictions on monetary policy arise. Thus, the classic Impossible Trinity becomes even less reconcilable.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

877	市场治理	Time and frequency dynamics of connectedness between cryptocurrencies and commodity markets	This paper analyses the time and frequency dynamics of connectedness between cryptocurrencies and commodity sectors. It supports that cryptocurrency plays a virtual character in the global financial markets. The total spillovers from cryptocurrencies to commodity markets alternate during the COVID-19 period. The time-frequency domain spillover results illustrate that both in the short-run and long-run, cryptocurrencies contribute to the system as the main transmitter in risk spillover. Besides, the net spillover alternatives with time in different frequencies. The portfolio results illustrate that the hedging effect of cryptocurrencies varies among commodity sectors before and after COVID-19. After COVID-19 the cryptocurrencies show a better hedging tool in our system, especially the hedging effect of cryptocurrencies on ENTR and PMTR sectors. Furthermore, investors need to take cryptocurrencies into the portfolio and adjust the weight of cryptocurrencies according to the alternative hedging effectiveness index, especially after COVID-19.	connectedness;portfolio diversification;cryptocurrencies;commodity markets;covid-19bitcoin;countries;assets;price;gold

We investigate the time-varying volatility connectedness between the two markets using their realized variances and semi-variances. Employing a multivariate Heterogeneous Autoregressive model, which accounts for both long memory and structural breaks in realized volatility time series, we find that China's thermal coal futures market is significantly dependent on the cryptocurrency market's volatility while the impact of the energy market on the cryptocurrency market is inconsequential. Moreover, the connectedness is asymmetrical in the sense that the bad volatility connectedness is greater than the good volatility connectedness. Finally, the determinants of the dynamic connectedness highlight the role of the production channel in fuelling the volatility transmission between these two markets.	volatility connectedness;asymmetry;structural breaks;cryptocurrencies;thermal coal futures;energy consumptionoil price volatility;long-memory;crude-oil;structural breaks;stock-market;fractional-integration;exchange-rate;bitcoin;return;risk
879	市场治理	Exploring the dynamic spillover of cryptocurrency environmental attention across the commodities, green bonds, and environment-related stocks	We analyze the dynamic spillover impact of cryptocurrency environmental attention (ICEA) on three asset classes: commodities, green bonds (GBs), and environment-related stocks. Our wavelet-based analysis suggests that ICEA is sharply escalated after the first quarter of 2021. During this period of intense attention, only the soybean commodity and Solactive GB tend to move positively and negatively with ICEA, respectively. Accordingly, the clean energy, sustainability, and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) stock indices are positively associated with ICEA during 2018-2019 at the medium frequency bands. In most periods and frequency domains, most commodities, GBs, and environment-related stocks are not strongly linked to ICEA. Moreover, Diebold and Yilmaz's (2014) spillover estimations signify no strong spillover effect of ICEA on the asset classes considered in this study. These findings are further corroborated by the wavelet-based Granger causality analysis. Moreover, our quantile regression (QR) estimations suggest that most assets are adversely influenced by ICEA, depending on the market conditions. Our research conveys some novel and vital policy ramifications to both investors and policymakers.	cryptocurrency environmental attention (icea) index;spillovers;commodity markets;green bond markets;environment-related stockseconomic-policy uncertainty;impulse-response analysis;media coverage;bitcoin;impact;inefficiency;returns;time
880	市场治理	A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Marketplace for Trustworthy Trade in Developing Countries	The possibilities that Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) offer for cooperation, development, and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are remarkable. This is because DLTs enable several key features, such as sharing complete information about every data transaction in the distributed system that participants belong to, the immutability of the recorded data transactions, or consensus among what data can be regarded as true, of great usefulness for the implementation of the SDGs. As far as developing countries are concerned, this information could be useful in trading locally produced goods, as it could enhance the reputation and profitability of Small-Scale Producers (SSPs). Unfortunately, it is rare to find a digitalized marketplace that has been specifically implemented for this application domain. This paper puts forward a blockchain-based marketplace that makes use of Smart Contracts and offers information about how the sold goods were produced and can be traced to their very origin. Besides, cloud computing has been conceived to be used in this development from the beginning to reduce the computational resources required by end user operations. An implementation with cloud computing facilities, software components running on the Ethereum blockchain and a web front end have been tested with satisfactory performance results.	blockchains;developing countries;sustainable development;costs;profitability;cloud computing;supply chains;distributed computing;sustainable development;peer-to-peer computingfood;traceability;system
881	市场治理	Are blockchain-based digital transformation and ecosystem-based business models mutually reinforcing? The principal-agent conflict perspective	This paper explores the implications of digitalization and business model innovation for the principal-agent conflict. Continuous digital transformation has recently become a feature sine qua non for companies. It is also stimulating business model innovation resulting in the growing adoption of ecosystem-based models. These trends may have significant implications for the principal-agent relationship, essential for understanding value creation by a firm. In order to analyze the impact of digital transformation, we use blockchain technology as a proxy. To measure the potential impact on the principal-agent conflict, we study management and shareholder-sponsored proposals at annual meetings. The level of shareholder involvement in governance is measured based on the number of shareholder-sponsored proposals received. In addition, we measure shareholder support for management-sponsored proposals. A sample of 2481 NYSE, Nasdaq and AMEX-traded firms for the period 2015-2019 is used. First of all, we show that digitalization per se has a mitigating impact on the agency conflict. Shareholders become more active, albeit not more hostile towards management. Secondly, we have identified the strongest impact in such sectors as information technology, communications, finance, and healthcare. These are the most significantly impacted by ecosystem-based business model innovation. We conclude that digitalization and ecosystem-based business models are mutually reinforcing in mitigating the principal-agent conflict.	corporate governance;digital transformation;ecosystems;corporate voting;shareholder activismcorporate governance;shareholder proposals;ownership;bitcoin
882	实体经济	Blockchain-based decentralized energy intra-trading with battery storage flexibility in a community microgrid system	The growing integration of distributed generations and battery storage equipped with smart meters paves a way to smartly manage the Distributed Energy Resources (DER) using a digital platform to improve the overall performance of the microgrid system. The deployment of distributed energy resources, particularly solar photovoltaic and wind generation, has transformed conventional power consumers into active prosumers. As a result of the expansion and digitalization of power distribution infrastructures, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy intratrading has evolved as a new paradigm in electricity trade in the community microgrid system. Blockchain is being used to encourage P2P energy intra-trading amongst prosumers, consumers, and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) owners because of its transparency, security, and speed in completing transactions. This P2P concept is further extended in this work to establish a self-sustained community microgrid system in energy trading with a case study to showcase the merits of blockchain technology in providing a secure and effective trading platform for mass users. As a result, the proposed work presents a solution for a secured energy management system that uses blockchain technology to create a decentralized microgrid energy market model that depicts P2P energy transactions with the incorporation of a battery storage system. Again, the microgrid P2P market settles the clearing price considering the probable response of customers when the price varies and incentive is paid to customers and prosumers to change the pattern of using of loads. According to the findings, end-users benefit from energy savings and self-sufficiency due to the combination of automated P2P trade and storage flexibility. Furthermore, a sort of crypto-currency "Cosmos (Atom)" is simulated in the P2P market model and published via the blockchain's mining mechanism. The proposed design framework presented in this paper has addressed the implementation of an effective energy management platform for developing a self-sustained microgrid system using distributed energy resources.	blockchain;smart contract;microgrid;peer -to -peer (p2p) energy intra-trading;battery energy storage system (bess)demand-side management
883	实体经济	Blockchain and deep learning based trust management for Internet of Vehicles	Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) works as the most advanced component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). In IoVs, vehicles are able to communicate with nearby vehicles or RoadSide Units (RSUs). Traffic safety and efficiency can be provided by collecting and uploading real-time traffic information through vehicles, as well as broadcasting information by RSUs. However, there may be malicious vehicles in the network uploading false information, which will lead to serious traffic problems. To alleviate this problem, a trust management system based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. In this system, vehicles in the network firstly collect information about their surroundings and then upload valid information to nearby RSUs. To prevent malicious vehicles from uploading false messages, this paper designs a deep learning based verification model to calculate the trustworthiness of uploaded messages, and to further obtain the credibility scores of vehicles using the calculated results, and detect malicious vehicles accordingly. Moreover, a public blockchain framework is proposed and a Proof-Of -Trust (POT) consensus algorithm is designed. Vehicles are motivated to report true and valid information, and are penalized for uploading false data under this framework. Simulation results show that this mechanism can effectively detect malicious vehicles and motivate unfamiliar vehicles to upload true and reliable information to achieve trust management in the open and dynamic vehicular network environments.	internetofvehicles;trustmanagement;blockchain;deeplearningchallenges;network;scheme
884	实体经济	An Efficient Data Sharing Scheme for Privacy Protection Based on Blockchain and Edge Intelligence in 6G-VANET	With the substantial increase in the number of smart cars, vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), where data can be shared between vehicles to enrich existing vehicle services and improve driving safety, is gaining more and more attention, thus creating a more efficient intelligent transportation system. Moreover, the in-depth research and development of 6G and AI technology further strengthen the interconnection of various entities in VANET and can realize edge intelligence, which fundamentally enhances the efficiency of data sharing. However, reliable transmission and secure storage of data have always been a great challenge in data sharing. Although some schemes store shared data in the blockchain, most of the consensus mechanisms they use employ full nodes to verify signature information and timestamps, which cannot effectively judge the reliability of the shared data itself. Some other schemes use scoring mechanisms to evaluate data uploaded by vehicles, but these methods can be affected by network hardware failures and cannot effectively detect duplicate data. In addition, participants' privacy may also be disclosed in the process of data sharing, such as participants' location and identity information. Therefore, to address the above problems, this paper proposes a data sharing scheme in 6G-VANET, which can not only ensure the reliability and security of shared data but also protect the privacy of participants. Firstly, a consortium chain is adopted to realize the secure storage of shared data in 6G-VANET, which meets the requirements of tamper-proof and traceability of data. Secondly, a voting consensus mechanism is designed in combination with smart contract to ensure the reliability of data. Thirdly, the trained word2vec natural language processing model is deployed to edge nodes to realize edge intelligence, effectively eliminate the duplicate shared data, and enhance storage efficiency. Finally, a participant privacy protection mechanism is designed using the Private Set Intersection (PSI) protocol, and a secure and efficient data sharing scheme is finally realized. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by security analysis and experimental evaluation. The experimental results show that the time and space overhead of blockchain can meet the practical requirements, and the proposed PSI protocol of large-scale vehicles can be completed in a short time.	set intersection;secure;internet;vehicles
885	核心技术	From Decentralization to Oligopoly: A Data-Driven Analysis of Decentralization Evolution and Voting Behaviors on EOSIO	As one of the most popular blockchain systems, EOSIO has been widely used in decentralized applications (DApps). Compared with traditional proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchain systems like Bitcoin, EOSIO achieves a high transaction throughput and an alleged decentralization with the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus protocol. However, recent reports claimed the existence of voting collusion and manipulation during the DPoS consensus procedure of EOSIO, which may greatly decline the decentralization degree, fault tolerance, and reliability of the whole system. In this article, we obtain data from up to 135 000 000 blocks of EOSIO and conduct a data-driven decentralization analysis. Specifically, we characterize the decentralization evolution of the two phases in DPoS, namely block producer election and block production. Moreover, we study the voters with similar voting behaviors and propose methods to discover abnormal mutual voting behaviors in EOSIO. The analysis results show how EOSIO gradually evolves from decentralization to oligopoly and our methods can effectively capture abnormal voting phenomena in the EOSIO, which can also provide important insights for the design and maintenance of other DPoS-based blockchains.	production;consensus protocol;behavioral sciences;voting;oligopoly;decentralized applications;indexes;blockchain;decentralization;delegated proof-of-stake (dpos);eosio;network analysis
886	核心技术	Blockchain Document Forwarding and Proof Method Based on NDN Network	The digitization of the national economy and the development of the national network have rapidly increased the amount of data, and research in content storage and forwarding is significant. The existing methods of storing certificates and distributing file content entirely rely on the judgment made by the router, and the forwarding process does not consider the security and legality of the data; at the same time, the traditional peer-to-peer (P2P) forwarding network files cannot be effectively reused, and additional security mechanisms are introduced. It affects the performance of the network itself. To improve the overall network performance, optimize the file forwarding process, and ensure the security of content and the verification of historical information, this paper proposes a method for document content storage and distribution that integrates blockchain technology and Named Data Network (NDN). The advantages of data signature encryption, reverse path forwarding of content, and flexible routing improves the overall performance of the forwarding network. Combined with blockchain decentralization technology, the documents and transaction processes can be stored on the chain to ensure the actual security of the forwarding process. In addition, this paper restricts the forwarding process in the NDN network without making any judgments through smart contract rules to ensure the security of confidential files during the forwarding process and, at the same time, limit the forwarding scope of irrelevant junk files in the private network. Finally, experiments prove that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the network's overall performance, optimize the forwarding process, and make rule judgments on the forwarding process of specific files to ensure the security of files.	blockchains;smart contracts;security;routing;licenses;ip networks;process control;blockchain;decentralization;ndn network;smart contracts;routing forwarding
887	核心技术	DeTi: A Decentralized Ticketing Management Platform	Event tickets being sold in their electronic instances are subject to counterfeiting, profiteering, and black markets. Therefore, suitable service management mechanisms are required to overcome such deficits. This work designs, develops, and evaluates the approach of a Decentralized Ticketing platform-called DeTi-for managing the distribution of electronic event tickets and "regulating" the aftermarket. DeTi offers a dedicated service management functionality by operating through Smart Contracts of Ethereum, such that users can verify tickets' validity for a given event. Especially, a new mechanism for users to detect fraudulent events is introduced, too. The evaluation performed indicates that DeTi invalidates or validates tickets efficiently via its decentralized and BC-based service management approach. By securing technically a set of underlying processes, DeTi obviates forging, replication, and scalping of tickets, allowing for a well-managed resale ecosystem of tickets based on and limited to the organizers' initial pricing.	blockchain;smart contracts;decentralized applications;decentralized ticketing;distributed service management
888	协同技术	Privacy-Preserving Searchable Encryption Scheme Based on Public and Private Blockchains	While users enjoy the convenience of data outsourcing in the cloud, they also face the risks of data modification and private information leakage. Searchable encryption technology can perform keyword searches over encrypted data while protecting their privacy and guaranteeing the integrity of the data by verifying the search results. However, some associated problems are still encountered, such as the low efficiency of verification and uncontrollable query results. Accordingly, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Searchable Encryption (PPSE) scheme based on public and private blockchains. First, we store an encrypted index in a private blockchain while outsourcing corresponding encrypted documents to a public blockchain. The encrypted documents are located through the encrypted index. This method can reduce the storage overhead on the blockchains, and improve the efficiency of transaction execution and the security of stored data. Moreover, we adopt a smart contract to introduce a secondary verification access control mechanism and restrict data users' access to the private blockchain through authorization for the purpose of guaranteeing data privacy and the correctness of access control verification. Finally, the security analysis and experimental results indicate that compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme can not only improve the security of encrypted data but also guarantee the efficiency of the query.	private blockchain;public blockchain;access control;forward privacy;backward privacysymmetric-encryption
889	技术治理	An analysis model for detecting misbehaviors in anonymous cryptocurrency	In online shopping, consumers often rely on information such as sales, reviews or ratings to inform their decision making. Such preferences or user behaviors can be subjected to manipulation. For example, a merchant can artificially inflate product sales by paying a click farm. Specifically, the click farm will recruit a number of non-genuine buyers to purchase the products. After the purchases have been made, the buyers will either refund the product minus the commission or no product exchange actually takes place and these buyers are paid a commission for their role in the activity. Increasingly due to the popularity of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, such payment mechanisms are used in such activities. Hence, in this paper, we seek to detect click farm transactions using cryptocurrency. Specifically, we propose three models to capture click farm operations, and based on the models we design three algorithms to detect anonymous click farm transactions. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our model achieves a high accuracy rate in detecting anonymous click farm transactions, without incurring expensive computational costs.	cryptocurrency;click farm;anonymous;blockchain
890	实体经济	Blockchain-based multi-user certificateless encryption with keyword search for electronic health record sharing	Nowadays, with the rapid development of smart health-care based on electronic health records, it remarkably supplies a promising way to alleviate the shortage of medical resources and improve medical efficiency. Meanwhile, data in electronic health records are sensitive and require protection against unauthorized access. However, most previous electronic health records sharing schemes are vulnerable to data leakage and forgery. To address these challenging problems, we propose a new electronic health record sharing scheme. We use the certificateless cryptosystem to encrypt keywords, which solves the certificate management problem and key escrow problem. The proposed scheme also supports multi-user search and the user authorization table can be used to modify access permissions of medical data users. Besides, the root values of the Merkle trees are written into the blockchain to ensure anti-tampering, integrity and traceability of search results. Moreover, a smart contract enables a fair transaction between cloud server provider and medical data users without trusted third parties. We prove that the proposed scheme is secure against the keyword guessing attack in the random oracle model. Furthermore, performance analysis demonstrates that our scheme has greater computational efficiency compared with other related schemes.	blockchain;certificateless cryptosystem;electronic health record sharing;multi-user;searchable encryptionpublic-key encryption;authenticated encryption

Blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to aid travel amid the pandemic hap. Presently, extant solutions are country or regional-based, downplay privacy, non-responsive, often impractical, and come with blockchain-related complexities presenting technological hurdle for travelers. We therefore propose a solution namely, Borderless to foster global travel allowing travelers and countries collaboratively engage in a secure adaptive proof protocol dubbed Proof-of-COVID-19 status a number of arbitrary statements to ascertain the fact that the traveler poses no danger irrespective of the country located. As far as we know, this is first of its kind. Borderless is implemented as a decentralized application leveraging blockchain as a trust anchor and decentralized storage technology. Security analysis and evaluation are performed proving security, privacy-preservation, and cost-effectiveness along with implementation envisioning it as a blueprint to facilitate cross-border travel during the present and future pandemics. Our experimental results show it takes less than 60 and 3 s to onboard users and perform proof verification respectively attesting to real usability scenarios along with the traits of arbitrary proofs to aid responsiveness to the dynamics of pandemics and blockchain abstraction from travelers.	blockchain;coronavirus;decentralized application;electronic health records;smart contract;travel
892	实体经济	Highly private blockchain-based management system for digital COVID-19 certificates	As a result of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, several proposals of blockchain-based solutions for digital COVID-19 certificates have been presented. Considering that health data have high privacy requirements, a health data management system must fulfil several strict privacy and security requirements. On the one hand, confidentiality of the medical data must be assured, being the data owner (the patient) the actor that maintain control over the privacy of their certificates. On the other hand, the entities involved in the generation and validation of certificates must be supervised by a regulatory authority. This set of requirements are generally not achieved together in previous proposals. Moreover, it is required that a digital COVID-19 certificate management protocol provides an easy verification process and also strongly avoid the risk of forgery. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a protocol to manage digital COVID-19 certificates where individual users decide how to share their private data in a hierarchical system. In order to achieve this, we put together two different technologies: the use of a proxy re-encryption (PRE) service in conjunction with a blockchain-based protocol. Additionally, our protocol introduces an authority to control and regulate the centers that can generate digital COVID-19 certificates and offers two kinds of validation of certificates for registered and non-registered verification entities. Therefore, the paper achieves all the requirements, that is, data sovereignty, high privacy, forgery avoidance, regulation of entities, security and easy verification.	health data;blockchain;privacy;smart contract;re-encryption;self-sovereigntyencryption
893	协同技术	Smart auto mining (SAM) for industrial IoT blockchain network	This work proposes smart auto mining (SAM) for resource-efficient mining in a blockchain network. The SAM algorithm stops the miners when there is zero pending transaction and starts the miner when there is at least one transaction sent into the network. The miner listens to the network to identify when a transaction has been made by a node. The model does not need any instruction to start mining when there is a pending transaction. The results show that a private Ethereum network produced over 300% more blocks in a 12-h period with 599,950 transactions compared to when SAM is applied. The proposed algorithm is also able to reduce the storage used by the chaindata by 14%. The overhead of mining is decreased by reducing the production of empty blocks in the network which saves energy, storage space, network bandwidth and computational complexity.	framework

We find that the rate of government intervention moderates the impact that Covid-19 cases/deaths have on cryptocurrency returns. We show that in periods of tight-ening government intervention, increases in Covid-19 cases positively predict cryptocurrency returns. We argue that this is due to investors imputing their expectations of the pandemic through a 'combined' signal.	covid-19;asset pricing;cryptocurrencybitcoin

In circumstances in which the typically-used Pearson correlation coefficient does not suffice, the Kendall rank correlation coefficient is routinely used as an alternative measure.

Simulation studies are conducted to show their good finite sample properties and robustness.

896	市场治理	Can blockchain innovation promote total factor productivity? Evidence from Chinese-listed firms	Although the importance of digital economy development has gradually been attached, blockchain technology has been widely questioned in China because it originated from bitcoin, which has been abandoned in China. Can blockchain innovation promote total factor productivity? Based on the blockchain patent data of Chinese-listed firms from 2012 to 2020, we show that blockchain innovation activities can improve the total factor productivity (TFP) of enterprises and verify its robustness using instrumental variable approach, system GMM and Heckman's two-step selection method. Results of mediation effect model show that enterprises' blockchain innovation activities mainly improve TFP through three channels: alleviating financing constraints, reducing supply chain concentration and inefficient investment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that electronic digital data processing blockchain patents have the highest practical value, while financial blockchain innovation inhibits the improvement of TFP in China. Blockchain innovation can bring positive effects on the TFP of manufacturing enterprises and leasing and business service enterprises. The increase in TFP of leasing and business service enterprises brought by blockchain innovation is nearly 70 times that of the baseline regression. We further provide blockchain innovation development suggestions for Chinese government based on these conclusions.	blockchain;total factor productivity;financing constraints;supply chain;inefficient investmentinvestment;bitcoin;constraints;governance

This study exploits this relocation event by examining the comovement of Binance's native token with the native tokens of other cryptocurrency exchanges in the origin and destination markets. Using multivariate regression analysis, our results show that Binance experienced a significant decline in comovement with its origin market after moving to Malta. The results are less evident for the destination market; however, an increase in comovement immediately after the relocation of Binance is notable.	exchange relocation;binance;altcoins;bitcoin;comovement

Interdependence declines during these bubbles relative to the post-bubble periods, and there is strong evidence of contagion over the whole sample and in the post-2021 bubble period. To illustrate their impact, optimal weights, volatility, and expected shortfall of a global minimum variance portfolio are examined. While volatility is higher during bubbles, the expected shortfall is stronger in the post-bubble periods.

We compare the performance of the different forecasts using a score function. The normal and asymmetric normal distributions presented the best performance for RVaR. Our findings suggest that the main driver for the RVaR of cryptocurrencies is the conditional standard deviation and not the distribution of the stochastic term. For the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), non-normal distributions present the best performance. We also note the advantages of RVaR over ES regarding regulatory arbitrage and model misspecification.	range value at risk (rvar);cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;risk forecastingexpected shortfall;robustness

We also measure the breadth and depth of risk diffusion for cryptocurrencies, and build panel regression models to identify what contributes to the risk diffusion. Our findings show that cryptocurrencies with large market capitalization, and others that experience decline in prices or low-turnover also contribute to the risk diffusion.	cryptocurrency market;risk diffusion;network analysisbitcoin;gold;connectedness;dollar

We find that leading cryptocurrencies spillovers dominate memecoins by falling while memecoins spillovers affect leading cryptocurrencies by rising. Moreover, we conduct regression analysis on a daily and 4-hourly basis, and the results confirm the findings above. In most periods, leading cryptocurrencies drive memecoins; however, when memecoins show a positive net spillover, it tends to trigger the leading cryptocurrencies to crash.	cryptocurrency;memecoins;tvp-var;connectedness;spillovers;crashdynamic connectedness;safe haven;bitcoin;return
902	实体经济	Mining Cryptocurrency-Based Security Using Renewable Energy as Source	Cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology using renewable energy as the main electricity source has gained attention for sustainable development in financial areas. However, very few studies have been reported concerning the power usage of cryptocurrencies using renewable energy. In this article, we report the effect of overclocking and undervolting on power usage and the hash rate for mining dogecoin with solar energy as renewable energy. The mining rig used in this work consists of different graphics processing units (GPUs) and non-LHR (lite hash rate) cards. The UnMineable software has been used for mining dogecoin as well as for wallet integration. The results indicate that mining dogecoin with solar energy as renewable energy consumes 2000 Watts power with overclocking and 1700 Watts power with undervolting technique. This work implicates the potential future of crypto-mining with renewable energy and the hardware configuration associated with it, which is expected to reduce e-waste and improve sustainable development. To reduce the e-waste and high electricity consumption, we have introduced two important techniques named GPU optimization and use of renewable energy for mining, which helps the miners to reduce the e-waste and electricity consumption significantly at the same time getting most out of the GPU by not having any impact on the environment.	consumption;bitcoin
903	协同技术	Building Trusted Federated Learning on Blockchain	Federated learning enables multiple users to collaboratively train a global model using the users' private data on users' local machines. This way, users are not required to share their training data with other parties, maintaining user privacy; however, the vanilla federated learning proposal is mainly assumed to be run in a trusted environment, while the actual implementation of federated learning is expected to be performed in untrusted domains. This paper aims to use blockchain as a trusted federated learning platform to realize the missing "running on untrusted domain" requirement. First, we investigate vanilla federate learning issues such as client's low motivation, client dropouts, model poisoning, model stealing, and unauthorized access. From those issues, we design building block solutions such as incentive mechanism, reputation system, peer-reviewed model, commitment hash, and model encryption. We then construct the full-fledged blockchain-based federated learning protocol, including client registration, training, aggregation, and reward distribution. Our evaluations show that the proposed solutions made federated learning more reliable. Moreover, the proposed system can motivate participants to be honest and perform best-effort training to obtain higher rewards while punishing malicious behaviors. Hence, running federated learning in an untrusted environment becomes possible.	federated learning;artificial intelligence;blockchain;smart contract

While, AI techniques are based on data sharing among the vehicles, it is important to note that sensitive data cannot be shared. Thus, federated learning (FL) has been implemented to protect privacy in vehicles. On the other hand, the integrity of data and the safety of aggregation are ensured by using blockchain technology. This paper applied classification approaches to VANET and ITS cyber-threats detection at the vehicle. Subsequently, by using blockchain and by applying an aggregation strategy to different models, models from the previous step were uploaded in a smart contract. Lastly, we returned the updated models to the vehicles. Furthermore, we conducted an experimental study to measure the effectiveness of the proposed prototype. In this paper, the VeReMi data set was distributed in a balanced manner into five parts in the experimental study. Thus, classification techniques were executed by each vehicle separately, and models were generated. Upon the aggregation of the models in blockchain, they were returned to the vehicles. Lastly, the vehicles updated their decision functions and accessed the precision and accuracy of cyber-threat detection. The results indicated that the precision and accuracy decreased by 7.1% on average with comparable F1-score and recall. Our solution ensures the privacy preservation of vehicles whereas blockchain guarantees the safety of aggregation technique and low gas consumption.	blockchain technology;cyberthreat;data privacy;federated learning;intelligent transport systems;vanetchallenges;internet;network

Complete transaction records in blockchains and the openness of data provide researchers with opportunities to mine and analyze data in blockchains. Network modeling and analysis of cryptocurrency transaction records are common methods in blockchain data analysis. The analysis of attribute graphs can provide insights into various economic indicators, illegal activities, and general Internet security, among others. Accordingly, this article aims to summarize and analyze the literature on cryptocurrency transaction data from the perspective of complex networks. To provide systematic guidance for researchers, we put forward a blockchain data analysis framework based on the introduction of the relevant background and reviewed the work from five aspects: blockchain data model, data acquisition on blockchains, existing analysis tools, available insights, and common analysis methods. For each aspect, we introduce the research problems, summarize the methods, and discuss the results and findings.

In addition, a distributed consensus coordination service system is used in the blockchain system to realize the synchronization of metadata and ensure the consistency of block data, configuration information, and transaction information.

However, they suffer from a trust deficit because of potential cheating by service providers (platforms). In this study, we design a blockchain-enabled system in which platforms tend to avoid cheating. The system employs an updated operation process to ensure reliable information inputs, a consortium blockchain network to avoid data tampering, and an intelligent algorithm embedded in a smart contract to automatically detect cheats. We then theoretically analyze the behavior of participants in the proposed system. In particular, we model the cheating decisions of a platform as chance-constrained programming and develop a Monte Carlo simulation method based on exploited optimality properties to solve it. Numerical experiments with real-world data demonstrate that the system reduces platforms' motivation to cheat to an acceptable level. We draw managerial and policy implications to improve system performance.	closed-loop supply chain;blockchain;online trade-in;trust;cheat detectionloop supply chain;product acquisition;quality;uncertainty;design

IIoT devices usually have limited computational power, while IIoT applications are mostly mission-critical and/or safety-critical. Therefore, these applications need computing resources that are closer to the devices. This work proposes a decentralized auction-based resource allocation mechanism in edge computing enabled IIoT using consortium blockchain and smart contract that shelves the involvement of a trusted third party, i.e. auctioneer. Various quality parameters are considered during resource allocation to address the mobility of both IIoT devices and edge resources, heterogeneity of edge servers, false assurance of edge servers, reliability, delay in results, and responsiveness of edge servers. Utility functions for IIoT devices are designed to calculate their degree of satisfaction depending on various quality parameters. The proposed blockchain-aided auction based mechanism fulfills various auction-based resource allocation requirements such as seal bidding, no impersonation of the bidder, no modification in any bid or result of allocation by the auctioneer, and proof for winners. The proposed work encourages edge servers for truthful bidding and furnishes the allocation results in polynomial time. Performance evaluation of the proposed model exhibits encouraging results.

909	核心技术	Mitigation of block withholding attack based on zero-determinant strategy	This article focuses on the mining dilemma of block withholding attack between the mining pools in the bitcoin system. In order to obtain the higher revenue, the rational mining pool usually chooses an infiltration attack, that is, the pool will falls into the mining dilemma of the PoW consensus algorithm. Thus the article proposes to apply zero-determinant strategies for optimizing the behavior selection of the mining pool under PoW consensus mechanism to increase the total revenues of the system, so as to solve the mining dilemma. After theoretically studying the set and extortionate strategy of zero-determinant, the article devises an adaptive zero-determinant strategy that the pool can change the corporation probability of the next round based on its previous revenues. To verify the effectiveness of zero-determinant strategies, based on the actual revenue of the mining pool defined and deduced in the paper, it simulates 30 sets of game strategies to illustrate the revenue variation of the mining pools. The simulation results show that the three zero-determinant strategies can effectively improve the convergence rate of cooperation, mitigate block withholding attack and maximize the total revenues of the system. Compared with the set and extortionate strategy, the adaptive strategy can ensure more stability and more revenue.	block withholding attack;zero-determinant;mining dilemma

The security features of Bitcoin rely on blockchain technology, which comprises each current as well as the past transactions in the system. In a blockchain when more than one block extends from the same preceding block, the situation is termed as fork or Block race. A selfish miner abuses Bit coin???s forks method to gain several unfair rewards. To tackle the issues caused by selfish mining, this work proposes a novel scheme called ???Towards the Rear Attuned Defense Scheme???. Accordingly, to identify the presence of selfish miners, the Newfangled selfish mining revelation algorithm with a Fork Tenacity Strategy is used here. A weighted fork with a secured fail parameter is established here to compete with the block race caused by the selfish miner. Finally, to ensure reliability, a Slice-up Tender mint consensus protocol is used. Thus, our proposed scheme ensures a better defense against the selfish mining attacks and achieves better time convergence with less electricity fee.	cryptocurrency;block race;fork;selfish mining;fork tenacity strategy;weight-ed fork;secured fail parameter;slice-up tender mint consensus protocol

In particular, the permutation entropy and clustering coefficient are investigated using the minimum, maximum, mean, and the geometric mean functions for the inbound, outbound, and loop directions. We find that the global clustering coefficient using the minimum function for triplets in a loop in one direction is the best measure in terms of predictive power and insight. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, the longer the time horizon, the greater the propensity to own Crypto. Our results are robust even among educated and financially literate households, and using different data sets. We then present a fully rational expectation household life cycle model, and demonstrate that household's time horizon should negatively influence the propensity to own crypto. We examine other explanations, such as, transaction cost (cost variation in learning crypto investment, cheaper for millennials) or the fear of missing out (FOMO) prospects, and find no significant change in the results. Altogether, the empirical and theoretical results suggest that households view Crypto as a pseudo productive/long-term asset class, and not speculative.	crypto currency;bitcoin;speculative asset;productive asset;demographics;saving motive;sophisticated investor;social investorbitcoin

Evidence from High Cryptocurrency Adoption Countries	This study analyzes whether Bitcoin, gold, oil, and stock have the ability to hedge against inflation in high cryptocurrency adoption countries in the periods from January 2010 to March 2021. It is hypothesized that the assets behave differently and thereby respond differently to inflation in different market conditions. Therefore, we employ the Markov Switching Vector Autoregressive to examine these assets' hedging ability against inflation in both stable and turbulent market regimes. Our main findings are threefold: We show that there exists a structural change and nonlinear relationship between the returns of hedging assets and inflation. Second, all assets can hedge against inflation more effectively in the short run than in the long run. We find that the inflation hedging ability of these assets are weak in the long run for both market regimes. We also find some evidence that the rigidity between the assets and inflation is relatively high in the stable regime. Third, according to the impulse response analysis, we also find that the responses of assets to inflation shock are heterogeneous across two market regimes.	bitcoin;hedging;inflation;ms-var;structural change;shockssafe-haven;oil price;common-stocks;time-series;gold;returns;us;impact

However, existing cab-sharing systems mainly depend on the centralized authority to provide many services, increasing privacy concerns and facing the single point of failure issue. Also, these systems expose drivers' or riders' locations and personal information that increase security issues, and charge high fees for services due to the involvement of third-party providers. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized and secure cab-sharing system to provide ride-sharing services using blockchain technology without any trusted third party. The proposed system uses the blockchain structure to preserve the driver's or rider's information, such as personal details, travel price, pickup or drop-off locations, departure or arrival date, and time. Furthermore, it implements the reputation feature to rate drivers and riders based on their travel history or behaviors without any centralized authority that allows users to select them based on their past experiences on the system. The proposed architecture is deployed using the Ethereum platform and functionality is designed using smart contracts. The performance evaluation and experimental results show that the proposed system requires low computational overheads and provides an efficient cab-sharing platform.	blockchains;vehicles;security;cryptography;smart contracts;privacy;consensus algorithm;ride-sharing system;delegated proof of stake;data security;reputation system
917	实体经济	Deep Learning Based Autonomous Transport System for Secure Vehicle and Cargo Matching	The latest 6G improvements secured autonomous driving's realism in Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems (IATS). Despite the IATS's benefits, security remains a significant challenge. Blockchain technology has grown in popularity as a means of implementing safe, dependable, and decentralised independent IATS systems, allowing for more utilisation of legacy IATS infrastructures and resources, which is especially advantageous for crowdsourcing technologies. Blockchain technology can be used to address security concerns in the IATS and to aid in logistics development. In light of the inadequacy of reliance and inattention to rights created by centralised and conventional logistics systems, this paper discusses the creation of a blockchain-based IATS powered by deep learning for secure cargo and vehicle matching (BDL-IATS). The BDL-IATS approach utilises Ethereum as the primary blockchain for storing private data such as order and shipment details. Additionally, the deep belief network (DBN) model is used to select suitable vehicles and goods for transportation. Additionally, the chaotic krill herd technique is used to tune the DBN model's hyperparameters. The performance of the BDL-IATS technique is validated, and the findings are inspected under a variety of conditions. The simulation findings indicated that the BDL-IATS strategy outperformed recent state-of-the-art approaches.	blockchain;ethereum;intelligent autonomous transport system;security;deep belief networkblockchain;management;safety;trust
918	协同技术	Distributed Neural Networks Training for Robotic Manipulation With Consensus Algorithm	In this article, we propose an algorithm that combines actor-critic-based off-policy method with consensus-based distributed training to deal with multiagent deep reinforcement learning problems. Specifically, convergence analysis of a consensus algorithm for a type of nonlinear system with a Lyapunov method is developed, and we use this result to analyze the convergence properties of the actor training parameters and the critic training parameters in our algorithm. Through the convergence analysis, it can be verified that all agents will converge to the same optimal model as the training time goes to infinity. To validate the implementation of our algorithm, a multiagent training framework is proposed to train each Universal Robot 5 (UR5) robot arm to reach the random target position. Finally, experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.	training;reinforcement learning;convergence;task analysis;robot kinematics;manipulators;privacy;consensus;deep reinforcement learning;lyapunov methods;manipulator;multiagent systems
919	核心技术	Research on PBFT consensus algorithm for grouping based on feature trust	The consensus mechanism is the core of the blockchain system, which plays an important role in the performance and security of the blockchain system . The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm is a widely used consensus algorithm, but the PBFT algorithm also suffers from high consensus latency, low throughput and performance. In this paper, we propose a grouped PBFT consensus algorithm (GPBFT) based on feature trust. First, the algorithm evaluates the trust degree of nodes in the transaction process through the EigenTrust trust model, and uses the trust degree of nodes as the basis for electing master nodes and proxy nodes. Then, the algorithm divides the nodes in the blockchain system into multiple groups, and the consensus within each independent group does not affect the other groups, which greatly reduces the communication overhead of the consensus process when the number of nodes in the system is large. Finally, we demonstrate through theoretical and experimental analysis that the GPBFT algorithm has a significant improvement in security and performance.	proofs
920	核心技术	A Derivative PBFT Blockchain Consensus Algorithm With Dual Primary Nodes Based on Separation of Powers-DPNPBFT	The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus algorithm has many advantages, which makes PBFT utilized widely. Nonetheless, PBFT is not suitable for large-scale node scenarios due to its high communication complexity and it also has an apparent disadvantage of inadequate fault tolerance. The typically derived PBFT algorithms focus on reducing communication complexity at the cost of diminished system security or fault tolerance. In this paper, Dual-Primary-Node derived Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPNPBFT) is proposed to achieve the best balance of the above three performances. First, DPNPBFT selects dual master nodes based on the idea of power separation. The two master nodes check balance and supervise each other to avoid excessive centralization as a single master node system. It also reduces the communication complexity of the replica node, which only communicates with the master node. Furthermore, we designed the architecture of DPNPBFT to get a practical 49% fault tolerance rate, and it is close to the current mainstream Proof of Work and Proof of Stake algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that DPNPBFT has O(N) level communication complexity and excellent anti-host node malicious performance. The Transactions Per Second of DPNPBFT is stable at 1700. It proves DPNPBFT has the best performance balance and excellent comprehensive performance for large-scale Internet of Things application scenarios.	complexity theory;consensus algorithm;fault tolerant systems;fault tolerance;blockchains;security;internet of things;blockchain;pbft;consensus algorithm;communication complexity
921	核心技术	Green-PoW: An energy-efficient blockchain Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm	This paper opts to mitigate the energy-inefficiency of the Blockchain Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm by rationally repurposing the power spent during the mining process. The original PoW mining scheme is designed to consider one block at a time and assign a reward to the first place winner of a computation race. To reduce the mining-related energy consumption, we propose to compensate the computation effort of the runner(s)-up of a mining round, by granting them exclusivity of solving the upcoming block in the next round. This will considerably reduce the number of competing nodes in the next round and consequently, the consumed energy. Our proposed scheme divides time into epochs, where each comprises two mining rounds; in the first one, all network nodes can participate in the mining process, whereas in the second round only runners-up can take part. Thus, the overall mining energy consumption can be reduced to nearly 50%. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first to considerably decrease the energy consumption of the original PoW algorithm. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our scheme in reducing energy consumption, the probability of fork occurrences, the level of mining centralization presented in the original PoW algorithm, and the effect of transaction censorship attack.	blockchain;consensus algorithm;proof-of-work;energy-efficiency
922	核心技术	A Trust-Based Hierarchical Consensus Mechanism for Consortium Blockchain in Smart Grid	As the smart grid develops rapidly, abundant connected devices offer various trading data. This raises higher requirements for secure and effective data storage. Traditional centralized data management does not meet the above requirements. Currently, smart grid with conventional consortium blockchain can solve the above issues. However, in the face of a large number of nodes, existing consensus algorithms often perform poorly in terms of efficiency and throughput. In this paper, we propose a trust-based hierarchical consensus mechanism (THCM) to solve this problem. Firstly, we design a hierarchical mechanism to improve the efficiency and throughput. Then, intra-layer nodes use an improved Raft consensus algorithm and inter-layer nodes use the Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm. Thirdly, we propose a trust evaluation method to improve the election process of Raft. Finally, we implement a prototype system to evaluate the performance of THCM. The results demonstrate that the consensus efficiency is improved by 19.8%, the throughput is improved by 12.34%, and the storage is reduced by 37.9%.	consortium blockchain;consensus algorithm;trust evaluation method;smart grid;internet of things (iot)byzantine fault-tolerance;networks;security;privacy
923	核心技术	Design and Development of a Blockchain-Based Secure Scoring Mechanism for Online Learning	With the rapid increase of online learning and online degree programs, the need for a secure and fair scoring mechanisms in online learning becomes urgent. In this research, a secure scoring mechanism was designed and developed based on blockchain technology to build transparent and fair interactions among students and teachers. The proposed scoring mechanism was implemented by employing the Ethereum blockchain and its three autonomous smart contracts. The robustness and feasibility of the system was then verified with experiments. The resulting system is shown to be superior to existing online learning systems because it prevents answer tampering. In addition, fairness can be improved with blockchain protocols and a collaborative scoring policy. Lastly, this system helps manage interactions among students and teachers during the process of educational assessment, and encourages all on-chain members to trust the online learning process. These advantages improve peer evaluation and self-directed learning that are essential for a student-centered and collaborative learning environment.	blockchain;ethereum;cryptography;online learning;online assessmenteducation
924	协同技术	Smart contract-based caching and data transaction optimization in mobile edge computing	The emergence of mobile edge computing can provide technical support for the development of Internet services and for coping with massive data traffic, thereby reducing network latency and ensuring efficient network operations and service delivery. However, the mobile edge computing environment is prone to data loss and privacy leakage, and data security and reliability cannot be guaranteed. The application of blockchain technology ensures the stability and dependability of data caching and transactions. In order to guarantee the security of data caching in the mobile edge computing environment and minimize the response time of caching servers, this paper proposes a decentralized data caching strategy in the mobile edge computing environment. The strategy uses a greedy algorithm to make the transmission delay of the requested content as small as possible under the multiple constraints of the storage space of each server and whether the content is cached on the server. To address the problem that data trading platforms are unable to afford the computation and storage of massive amounts of data and cannot guarantee that the data will not be leaked, this paper proposes a secure decentralized data transaction program. The scheme promotes the increase of transaction turnover rate and improves the revenue of both participating parties by establishing a buyer-seller matching algorithm. According to the experimental results, the proposed data caching strategy can improve the cache hit rate and reduce the transmission delay; the proposed data transaction solution can increase the revenue of both the data holder and the data buyer.

926	虚拟经济	Blockchain and the emergence of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs): An integrative model and research agenda	Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are blockchain-based organizations fed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of contributors. Their management is decentralized without top executive teams and built on automated rules encoded in smart contracts, and their governance works autonomously based on a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms that support community decision-making. A growing body of literature has emerged exploring DAOs. However, there is a considerable lack of clarity about this organizational design and its theoretical conceptualization. To this end, we undertake an integrative literature review that reveals three main principles-decentralized, automated and autonomous organizations-and the following four theoretical perspectives mainly adopted to examine this novel organizational form: transaction cost theory, institutions for collective action, agency theory, and socio-materiality. By extending these theories, we propose an integrative model of DAO for research and theory building. Our contribution provides conceptual clarity and proposes a framework for future research directions.	dao;blockchain;decentralized autonomous organizations;human -machine agency;collective action;tokengovernance;technology;economy;separation
927	技术治理	VULPEDIA: Detecting vulnerable ethereum smart contracts via abstracted vulnerability signatures	Recent years have seen smart contracts are getting increasingly popular in building trustworthy decentralized applications. Previous research has proposed static and dynamic techniques to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. These tools check vulnerable contracts against several predefined rules. However, the emerging new vulnerable types and programming skills to prevent possible vulnerabilities emerging lead to a large number of false positive and false negative reports of tools. To address this, we propose VULPEDIA, which mines expressive vulnerability signatures from contracts. VULPEDIA is based on the relaxed assumption that the owner of contract is not malicious. Specifically, we extract structural program features from vulnerable and benign contracts as vulnerability signatures, and construct a systematic detection method based on detection rules composed of vulnerability signatures. Compared with the rules defined by state-of-the-arts, our approach can extract more expressive rules to achieve better completeness (i.e., detection recall) and soundness (i.e., precision). We further evaluate VULPEDIA with four baselines (i.e., Slither, Securify, SmartCheck and Oyente) on the testing dataset consisting of 17,770 contracts. The experiment results show that VULPEDIA achieves best performance of precision on 4 types of vulnerabilities and leading recall on 3 types of vulnerabilities meanwhile exhibiting the great efficiency performance.

928	协同技术	Blockchain-based AMI framework for data security and privacy protection	As a key component of smart grid (SG), advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) realizes two-way communication between users and power companies. Considering that AMI involves a large number of important data, which are related to the measurement of users' electricity bills and the decisionmaking of power suppliers. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of AMI data security and privacy to avoid economic losses caused by data leakage and tampering. Aiming at the problems of trust and single point of failure in the existing protection schemes, this paper proposes an AMI security framework based on blockchain. By combining the characteristics of blockchain such as decentration, tamper proof, traceability, the architecture of AMI data management system is reshaped. The technologies of peer-to-peer (P2P) transmission, asymmetric encryption, consensus algorithm and smart contract of blockchain are used to solve the problems of secure storage, transmission and application of AMI data. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, the feasibility of introducing blockchain technology into AMI is verified. The results show that the proposed framework is secure and reliable, which provides a strong guarantee for AMI data security and privacy protection. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

929	技术治理	MP-GCN: A Phishing Nodes Detection Approach via Graph Convolution Network for Ethereum	Blockchain is making a big impact in various applications, but it is also attracting a variety of cybercrimes. In blockchain, phishing transfers the victim's virtual currency to make huge profits through fraud, which poses a threat to the blockchain ecosystem. To avoid greater losses, Ethereum, one of the blockchain platforms, can provide information to detect phishing fraud. In this study, to effectively detect phishing nodes, we propose a phishing node detection approach as message passing based graph convolution network. We first form a transaction network through the transaction records of Ethereum and then extract the information of nodes effectively via message passing. Finally, we use a graph convolution network to classify the normal and phishing nodes. Experiments show that our method is effective and superior to other existing methods.	graph convolution network;ethereum;phishing fraud;message passing
930	核心技术	Can Texas mitigate wind and solar curtailments by leveraging bitcoin mining?	An increased capacity to produce renewable energy has led to power curtailments due to the lack of storage for energy oversupply. This excess energy could make a profit if it was used and managed effectively. Bitcoin, with its recent boom, associated market values, and excessive energy consumption during mining presents a win-win proposition for managing renewable energy curtailments. Therefore, in a bid to minimize renewable energy curtailments from the perspective of the independent system operator (ISO) while maximizing the profit for the investor, this study attempts to discover the optimal planning and operation of a bitcoin mining farm to minimize renewable energy curtailments. Specifically, renewable energy curtailments for the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) at an hourly resolution and the difficulty and price, respectively of bitcoin mining during 2020 and 2021, were considered in our analysis of the cost and profitability of bitcoin mining using curtailed renewable power. Besides, a greenhouse gas (GHG) analysis was also conducted to evaluate the annual emissions from each of the cases considered in this study. The results demonstrated that 93% of the curtailed energy could be used at a minimal cost to generate a $239 million profit. From an investor's perspective, 69.8% of the curtailed power could be used to generate a profit of $605 million. Cost minimization case scenario had the least amount of emissions followed by profit maximization case with penalty scenario. Sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the effect of system parameters on the optimization results for an in-depth analysis of possible policy and investment decisions from the perspectives of both the ISOs and investors. Despite the uncertainties associated with the price of bitcoin, it was estimated that ERCOT, with its current renewable energy curtailments, would still be profitable in the case of profit maximization if the bitcoin price remains above $6800 throughout the year. Accordingly, bitcoin mining has substantial potential for becoming an effective medium to prevent renewable energy curtailments and turn energy oversupply into profit.	renewable curtailment;bitcoin mining;cryptocurrency;economic analysis;mixed integer linear problemhydrogen system
931	核心技术	Preventing proof-of-work mining attacks	Bitcoin mining is the process of generating new blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain. This pro-cess is vulnerable to different types of attacks. One of the most famous attacks in this cat-egory is selfish mining. This attack is essentially a strategy that a sufficiently powerful mining pool can follow to obtain more revenue than its fair share. The reason that selfish mining is effective is the difficulty adjustment algorithm used in the Bitcoin network. In this paper, we analyze the profitability of selfish mining with respect to time and propose an alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm that discourages selfish mining while allow-ing the Bitcoin network to remain scalable. We analyze our proposed solution, present the results, and discuss its effectiveness. Based on our analysis, our proposed algorithm effec-tively increases the profitability waiting time for the attackers to almost double its original value. For example, for a miner with 40% of the network's hash power, the algorithm extends the waiting time from 4 weeks to more than 11 weeks. This will discourage attack-ers from performing their malicious activities. We also show that our proposed algorithm allows the network to scale while it increases the waiting time.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

932	法律治理	Mining bitcoins with carbon capture and renewable energy for carbon neutrality across states in the USA	Bitcoin mining requires a significant amount of electricity to validate blocks, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, major countries such as China, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Vietnam are banning bitcoin mining to avoid grid imbalances, power failures, and environmental issues. To alleviate these concerns, we conducted a techno-economic analysis of 50 states and a federal district (Washington D.C.) in the US in terms of the feasibility of bitcoin mining using carbon capture and renewable energy. We analyzed the profitability of bitcoin mining in the US states using grid and renewable power resources along with high-temperature and low temperature direct air capture technologies for CO2 capture and storage and methanol as a product. From both economic and environmental perspectives, we evaluated the net CO2 emission for each state to determine its competitive advantages. Overall, this work offers a holistic overview of where bitcoin mining can be economically viable across US states. Additionally, it provides insights into achieving environmentally friendly cryptocurrency mining regulations based on carbon capture and renewable energy and gauging the costs of bitcoin mining powered by the grid and high renewable penetration across the US states while pursuing carbon neutrality.	emissions;challenges;networks;co2

DCCs in most sample regions are positive, implying a strong linkage of Bitcoin and local stock markets. Furthermore, a region's capital account control of has positive impact on DCC, and the impact is more pronounced in regions with better money laundering supervision and less developed financial systems. This implies that Bitcoin, with investment and illegal purposes, tends to be likely used as an unregulated global currency to channel the funds from home to abroad. Finally, we also find that the rise in DCC will increase the pressure on the local financial system. Our study can assist cryptocurrency investors and regulators in making more informed decisions.	stock market;bitcoin;co-movement;determinants;consequencevolatility
934	市场治理	Price discovery in bitcoin spot or futures during the Covid-19 pandemic? Evidence from the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model with stochastic volatility	This paper examines price discovery between bitcoin spot and futures using static measures, namely information share (IS), component share (CS), modified information share (MIS), information leadership share (ILS), impulse response, and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model with stochastic volatility and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm. Our one-minute and daily datasets cover 16 months before and 16 months during the Covid-19 pandemic (November 2018 to June 2021). Our IS, CS, MIS and impulse response results indicate a stronger bitcoin spot leadership, whereas our ILS results point to a weaker bitcoin futures dominance, during the Covid-19 pandemic. We construe this, as far as microstructure noise is concerned, as meaning that the bitcoin price is discovered in the spot market, and its dominance appears to have strengthened during the pandemic. However, as far as 'pure speed' is concerned, price discovery takes place in the bitcoin futures market, and its leadership seems to have weakened during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results of the time-varying measure (TVP-VAR) imply that, before the pandemic, price discovery took place within bitcoin futures but, during the pandemic, price discovery leadership has changed course, to occur within bitcoin spot.	bitcoin;price discovery;tvp-var;markov chain monte carlo;futures;covid-19
935	市场治理	ASYMMETRIC TAIL DEPENDENCE MODELING, WITH APPLICATION TO CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET DATA	Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, cryptocurrencies have played an increasing role in the world of e-commerce, but the recent turbulence in the cryptocurrency market in 2018 has raised some concerns about their stability and associated risks. For investors it is crucial to uncover the dependence relationships between cryptocurrencies for a more resilient portfolio diversification. Moreover, the stochastic behavior in both tails is important, as long positions are sensitive to a decrease in prices (lower tail), while short positions are sensitive to an increase in prices (upper tail). In order to assess both risk types, we develop in this paper a flexible copula model which is able to distinctively capture asymptotic dependence or independence in its lower and upper tails simultaneously. Our proposed model is parsimonious and smoothly bridges (in each tail) both extremal dependence classes in the interior of the parameter space. Inference is performed using a full or censored likelihood approach, and we investigate by simulation the estimators' efficiency under three different censoring schemes which reduce the impact of nonextreme observations. We also develop a local likelihood approach to capture the temporal dynamics of extremal dependence among pairs of leading cryptocurrencies. We here apply our model to historical closing prices of five leading cryotocurrencies which share large cryptocurrency market capitalizations. The results show that our proposed copula model outperforms alternative copula models and that the lower-tail dependence level between most pairs of leading cryptocurrencies and, in particular, Bitcoin and Ethereum has become stronger over time, smoothly transitioning from an asymptotic independence regime to an asymptotic dependence regime in recent years, whilst the upper tail has been relatively more stable overall at a weaker dependence level.	copula model;cryptocurrency data;extreme-value theory;joint-tail modeling;tail dependenceextreme-value dependence;multivariate;statistics;copula;distributions;independence
936	市场治理	Modeling innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem	Blockchains are among the most relevant emerging technologies of recent times and, according to many, they will have a central role in shaping the future of our society. Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the first notorious blockchain system bound to a cryptocurrency, the blockchain ecosystem has experienced a huge growth, driven by innovations both in conceptual and algorithmic terms, and in the creation of a large number of new cryptocoins. New blockchains and their associated cryptocoins, emerge mostly as the result of forking already existing projects. Here, we show that the appearance of new cryptocoins can be well described by a sub-linear power-law (Heaps' law) of the total crypto-market capitalization. At the same time, we propose a model that well reproduces the evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Our model suggests that each cryptocurrency triggers, on average, the creation of ca. 1.58 novel cryptocoins, a result confirmed by the analysis of the Bitcoin historical forking tree. Moreover, we deduce that the largest cryptocurrency, nowadays Bitcoin, will comprise around the 50% of the whole crypto-market and that this fraction is going to stabilize in the near future, provided that the present fundamental macro-economic conditions do not change radically.	blockchain

We deliver a sharded blockchain technology with unlimited scalability, called KSI Cash, which is based on a new form of electronic money scheme, the bill scheme. We present performance tests of KSI Cash that we have conducted with the European Central Bank in order to assess the feasibility of a digital euro. We show the system operating with 100 million wallets and 15,000 transactions per second (under simulation of realistic usage); having an estimated carbon footprint of 0.0001g CO2 per transaction. Furthermore, we show the system operating with up to 2 million payment orders per second, an equivalent of more than 300,000 transactions per second (in a laboratory setting with the central components of KSI Cash), scaling linearly in the number of shards. We explain, in detail, the key concepts that unlock this performance (i.e., the concepts of the bill money scheme). The results provide evidence that the scalability of our technology is unlimited in both permissioned and permissionless scenarios, resulting into the Alphabill Money technology. Next, we contribute the architecture of a universal tokenization platform that allows for universal asset tokenization, transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange, called Alphabill platform. We reveal the crucial conceptual and technical contributions of the platform's architecture, including the data structures of KSI Cash and Alphabill Money, the dust collection solution of Alphabill Money, and the atomic swap solution of the Alphabill platform.	blockchains;scalability;tokenization;bitcoin;fabrics;data structures;technological innovation;blockchain;bitcoin;digital euro;decentralized finance;defi;web3;alphabilltransaction-cost economics;technology;system;algorithm;knowledge;framework;security

By analyzing 17,490 news coverages by 91 major English-language newspapers listed in the LexisNexis database from around the globe from January 2012 until August 2021, I found news media sentiments to play a significant role in Bitcoin volatility. Following the heterogeneous autoregressive model for realized volatility (HAR-RV)-which uses the heterogeneous market idea to create a simple additive volatility model at different scales to learn which factor is influencing the time series-along with news sentiments as explanatory variables, showed a better fit and higher forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, I also found that psychological sentiments have medium-term and financial sentiments have long-term effects on Bitcoin volatility. Moreover, the National Research Council Emotion Lexicon showed the main emotional drivers of Bitcoin volatility to be anticipation and trust.	bitcoin;news sentiments;natural language processing;range-based volatility;har-rv (heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility)investor sentiment;realized volatility;textual analysis;emotional words;long-memory;stock;media;price;model;erp
942	实体经济	Blockchain-based identity management and access control framework for open banking ecosystem	Financial institutions are following an open banking (OB) trend for service innovation and integration. OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum.

943	虚拟经济	Change in Blink Rate in the Metaverse VR HMD and AR Glasses Environment	Blink rate, a major physiological response in humans, directly affects ocular diseases such as keratitis and dry eye. The blink rate in normal eyes appears at a constant frequency of 6-30 times per minute and is constant for each individual. In a previous study, the blink rate decreased when viewing content with high intensity and realism. Therefore, we tried to investigate the change in blink rate when viewing the content in VR HMD (virtual reality head-mounted display) and AR (augmented reality) glasses environments. We compared and analyzed the blink rate in four environments: natural state, viewing monitor, viewing VR HMD, and viewing AR glasses. Twenty-one participants (age, 26.87 +/- 3.31 years) viewed the content for 1 min in four environments. One-way repeated ANOVA was used to analyze the blink rate changes. The study showed that the blink rate was decreased in the monitor, VR HMD, and AR glasses environments compared to that in the natural environment. Comparing the VR HMD environment with the AR glasses environment showed that the blink rate decreased in the VR HMD environment. The results of this study can be used for content use safety recommendations (guidelines for safe use of contents due to decreased blink rate) in the VR HMD and AR glasses environments, which are currently attracting attention in the metaverse.	blink rate;metaverse;vr hmd;ar glasses;guidelineeyelid movements;disease;humans
944	平台项目	Resource Analysis of Blockchain Consensus Algorithms in Hyperledger Fabric	In the blockchain network, the consensus algorithm is used to tolerate node faults with data consistency and integrity, so it is vital in all blockchain services. Previous studies on the consensus algorithm have the following limitations: 1) no resource consumption analysis was done, 2) performance analysis was not comprehensive in terms of blockchain parameters (e.g., number of orderer nodes, number of fault nodes, batch size, payload size), and 3) practical fault scenarios were not evaluated. In other words, the resource provisioning of consensus algorithms in clouds has not been addressed adequately. As many blockchain services are deployed in the form of blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS), how to provision consensus algorithms becomes a key question to be answered. This study presents a kernel-level analysis for the resource consumption and comprehensive performance evaluations of three major consensus algorithms (i.e., Kafka, Raft, and PBFT). Our experiments reveal that resource consumption differs up to seven times, which demonstrates the importance of proper resource provisioning for BaaS.	peer-to-peer computing;consensus algorithm;fabrics;distributed ledger;blockchains;proposals;throughput;blockchain;blockchain-as-a-service;cloud;consensus algorithm;hyperledger fabric;performance analysis;kafka;raft;pbft;microsoft azure;awsperformance

However, as previous studies related to the metaverse have focused on strengthening personalized content and services, additional research is needed in order to understand the metaverse's effects at the organizational level. This study aims to present the conditions for strengthening the motivation to use the metaverse from the perspective of organizations and members who have applied the metaverse in the workplace on a trial basis. In this study, an online questionnaire was conducted targeting workers of organizations with a history of using the metaverse for business, and the hypotheses were tested using 304 valid samples. As a result of the analysis, it was found that telepresence, a characteristic of the metaverse, influences the intention to continue using the metaverse through informativeness, interactivity, and enjoyment. In addition, the shared goal of the organization's digital transformation moderated the influence relationship between telepresence and an individual's motivations, and an individual's digital competence moderated the influence relationship between motivation and the intention of continuous use. This study suggests a digital transformation strategy for an organization in terms of suggesting ways to strengthen the motivations for the use of the metaverse of employees in the organization.	metaverse;intention of continuous use;use and gratification;telepresence;shared goal of digital transformation;digital competencegratifications;technology;experience;intention;impact;mobile
946	虚拟经济	A metaverse assessment model for sustainable transportation using ordinal priority approach and Aczel-Alsina norms	Metaverse comes from the meta-universe, and it is the integration of physical and digital space into a virtual universe. Metaverse technologies will change the transportation system as we know it. Preparations for the transition of the transportation systems into the world of metaverse are underway. This study considers four alternative metaverses: auto-driving algorithm testing for training autonomous driving artificial intelligence, public transportation operation and safety, traffic operation, and sharing economy applications to obtain sus-tainable transportation. These alternatives are evaluated on thirteen sub-criteria, grouped under four main aspects: efficiency, operation, social and health, and legislation and regulation. A novel Rough Aczel-Alsa (RAA) function and the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) method are used in the assessment model. We also present a case study to demonstrate the applicability and exhibit the efficacy of the assessment framework in prioritizing the metaverse implementation alternatives.	metaverse;transportation engineering;ordinal priority approach;multi-criteria decision making;aczel - alsina functionsmanagement
947	虚拟经济	Metaverse beyond the hype: Multidisciplinary perspectives on emerging challenges, opportunities, and agenda for research, practice and policy	The metaverse has the potential to extend the physical world using augmented and virtual reality technologies allowing users to seamlessly interact within real and simulated environments using avatars and holograms. Virtual environments and immersive games (such as, Second Life, Fortnite, Roblox and VRChat) have been described as antecedents of the metaverse and offer some insight to the potential socio-economic impact of a fully functional persistent cross platform metaverse. Separating the hype and "meta..." rebranding from current reality is difficult, as "big tech" paints a picture of the transformative nature of the metaverse and how it will positively impact people in their work, leisure, and social interaction. The potential impact on the way we conduct business, interact with brands and others, and develop shared experiences is likely to be transformational as the distinct lines between physical and digital are likely to be somewhat blurred from current perceptions. However, although the technology and infrastructure does not yet exist to allow the development of new immersive virtual worlds at scale -one that our avatars could transcend across platforms, researchers are increasingly examining the transformative impact of the metaverse. Impacted sectors include marketing, education, healthcare as well as societal effects relating to social interaction factors from widespread adoption, and issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and impact on vulnerable people. This study examines these topics in detail by combining the informed narrative and multi-perspective approach from experts with varied disciplinary backgrounds on many aspects of the metaverse and its transformational impact. The paper concludes by proposing a future research agenda that is valuable for researchers, professionals and policy makers alike.	avatars;augmented reality;extended reality;metaverse;second life;virtual reality;virtual worldvirtual worlds;2nd life;digital transformation;augmented reality;social media;co-creation;customer journey;service quality;business model;information

950	实体经济	Cryptocurrency: The Future of Plastic Surgery Payments?	Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that allow for peer-to-peer transactions, maintained by a decentralized, secure, and trust-based system. Similar to the patient-centered care approach, cryptocurrency empowers the individual to transact, without a third-party, in a safe, largely transparent, and fast way. Awareness of the current economic state and the ongoing growth of cryptocurrency can place plastic surgeons in a unique and opportune position to broaden payment acceptance methods and create a more effective business model. By first creating a digital wallet for storage, and then employing a payment processing tool, transacting with cryptocurrency becomes practical and convenient. This paper explores the advantages and limitations of cryptocurrency and provides a high-level breakdown of the basics of accepting and transacting with cryptocurrency within a successful plastic surgery practice.

In the process of knowledge fusion in conversation systems, knowledge and contributions from multiple experts are easily tampered with, which results in biases in fusion results and their incentives. Blockchains promise tamper-proof, secure, and transparent systems. This study explores the feasibility and effectiveness of knowledge fusion based on blockchain by adopting a smart contract. First, a blockchain-based framework for decentralised knowledge fusion for a conversation system is presented. Second, a concrete scheme of blockchain-based decentralised knowledge fusion is designed and implemented with smart contracts to ensure security execution and fairness. Finally, a use case-based evaluation to prove the effectiveness of the proposed decentralised knowledge fusion method is presented.	decentralized knowledge fusion;conversation system;blockchain;smart contract;trustworthymanagement

Our results show that the impact of cryp-tocurrency on China's financial market is relatively strong, but the impact of China's financial market on cryptocurrency is very weak. Furthermore, negative spillovers are stronger than pos-itive spillovers. The average negative volatility spillover is dominant for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the average positive volatility spillover is dominant for Ripple. This study has implications for investors and policymakers.	cryptocurrency;volatility spillover;asymmetry;tvp-var model

Due to infrequent jumps in Bitcoin prices, this paper employs the ARJI model of Chan and Maheu (2002) to describe jump risks of Bitcoin prices, and to examine the possible influencing factors of jump risks. Empirical results find that the jump component is the most important driving force of the volatility of Bitcoin returns, and that two investor sentiment indicators (the Bitcoin trading volumes and the number of Bitcoin unique addresses) are positive related to the jump risk of Bitcoin returns. These findings provide an important insight into the investment risk of Bitcoin prices.	bitcoin;jump risks;investor sentiment indicators;volatility

Results indicate that NYSE trading sessions lead Bitcoin trading activity, both on the blockchain and centralised exchanges. Effects are found to have strengthened over time, however, simultaneously diminished at the weekend indicating significant exchange interactions, and that Bitcoin has developed somewhat outside its intended design parameters and is influenced by other forces such as those originating from NYSE trading. While proponents consider Bitcoin trading to be '24/7', our findings suggest that both transaction and on-chain network activity are best described to be, at best, '12/5', presenting significant implications for traders, with regards to centralised exchange liquidity and the speed of their transaction inclusion on the blockchain. Finally, the role and influence of both algorithm and volatility traders cannot be eliminated.	bitcoin;blockchain;cryptocurrency;liquidity;networks;transaction volumes

We observed an increase in bitcoin trade volume spur both carbon and energy footprint by 24% in the long-run, whereas a dynamic shock in trade volume escalates bitcoin energy and carbon footprint by 46.54%.	general-to-specific var;granger causality;steady-state effects;bitcoin energy consumption;bitcoin carbon footprintcausality

Although Bitcoin is found to be one of the most unpredictable cryptocurrencies with excessive volatilities, researchers are still looking for determinants of Bitcoin prices. In this study, we firstly adopt the Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) approach to evaluate the effect of investor attention on Bitcoin returns by constructing an aggregate investor attention proxy. We combine both direct and indirect proxies for investor attention, in addition to the Bitcoin trading variables as the LSTM inputs. Our empirical results suggest that the including of attention variables could effectively improve the LSTM's prediction accuracy of Bitcoin returns, whereas direct proxies, i.e., Google Trends and Tweets, contain more valuable information to further improve the LSTM's forecasting capacity.	investor attention;bitcoin;machine learning;lstm;social media;google trends;tweetsneural-network;hybrid model;prediction;volatility;information;exchange;search;index

Furthermore, we find that the causality relationship between bitcoin and economic policy uncertainty is relatively indistinct around the period of bitcoin's currency recognition, while bitcoin returns are leading economic policy uncertainty changes during COVID-19 pandemic crisis, indicating the economic policy uncertainty fluctuation trend can refer to the fluctuation of bitcoin, bitcoin can be viewed as a leading indicator, but it could not be employed as a safe-haven asset hedge against uncertainty during the period of COVID-19 pandemic.	bitcoin;economic policy uncertainty;lead-lag relationship;continuous wavelet analysisgold price;co-movements;us;commodities;causality;markets;dollar
958	实体经济	Decentralized Consensus Blockchain and IPFS-Based Data Aggregation for Efficient Data Storage Scheme	By the development and advancement of blockchain technique, Internet of Things (IoT) proliferation driven devices and the application of blockchain-enabled IoT alter the view and operating infrastructure of the smart networks. The blockchain is responsible for supporting decentralized systems and offers secured means of authentication, management, and access to IoT system thereby deploying smart contracts offered by Ethereum. The increasing demand and the blockchain expansion generate huge volume of sensitive data. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain-IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Furthermore, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are regarded as the most promising threats for smart contracts in the blockchain-based systems. Therefore, there is a need to detect and classify the attack type and the data should be stored in server more securely with the use of blockchain and data aggregation method. For this purpose, this presented technique aims at introducing decentralized consensus blockchain and Interplanetary file system (IPFS) based data aggregation for effective classification and data storage. The attack is detected using meta-hyperparameter random forest (MHP-RF) classifier. Once the attack is detected, the transaction information is stored in server securely by means of smart contract-based blockchain system. The transaction handling stage classifies the transaction type as normal or abnormal one which then followed by execution of business logic by smart contract thereby appending the transaction of blockchain in the network cloud. The consensus blockchain technique is employed with the use of PoW-enabled scheme integrated with Elgamal-based data aggregation. Therefore, the system security is improved and the intrusion is prevented greatly. The performance analysis of the system is analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, Encryption time, decryption time, execution time, and space complexity. The attained outcomes are compared with traditional approaches to prove the effectiveness of proposed strategy. The proposed system is said to be effective in time consumption, classifier performance, and in overcoming space complexity issues.

It could be defined as a chain of blocks that stores information with digital signatures in a distributed and decentralized network. This technique was first adopted for the creation of digital cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, research and industrial studies have recently focused on the opportunities that blockchain provides in various other application domains to take advantage of the main features of this technology, such as: decentralization, persistency, anonymity, and auditability. This paper reviews the use of blockchain in several interesting fields, namely: finance, healthcare, information systems, wireless networks, Internet of Things, smart grids, governmental services, and military/defense.

960	市场治理	Theorizing the 2017 blockchain ICO bubble as a network scam	In the popular imagination and in academic literature, scams are usually seen as dyadic, involving a con artist and a mark. This article retheorizes scams as networked, collective activity. Scams, like all commerce, are shaped by and in turn shape communication channels. The "network scam" is therefore offered as a lens for understanding scams in the digital economy more broadly. As a case study, this article documents the 2017 Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Bubble. ICOs were supposed to be a new, radically disruptive way of crowdfunding to finance the development of a new, radically disruptive blockchain technological ecosystem. All told, ICOs raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 alone. But by all analyses-both from observers and participants, both during the bubble and after-the vast majority of ICO turned out to be scams. This article uses these scams to theorize the "network scam" as a collaborative effort to bring about a shared future, but one that is fundamentally characterized by arbitrage on uneven belief among participants in that future ever coming to pass.	bitcoin;blockchain;crowdfunding;cryptocurrency;digital economy;ethereum;initial coin offerings;scams
961	技术治理	Ethereum transaction tracking: Inferring evolution of transaction networks via link prediction	Blockchain is an emerging technology which has attracted wide attention in recent years. As one of the blockchain applications, cryptocurrency has developed rapidly in recent years, attracting criminals to commit fraud and money laundering. Therefore, to better protect the legitimate interests of users and help formulate an effective supervision, it is necessary to track and follow transaction records on blockchain-based systems. This paper studies the problem of transaction tracking in Ethereum from a network perspective, aiming to study explainable strategies for money flow generation. We first collect the space-intensive transaction data from Ethereum blockchain and model them as temporal weighted multi-digraphs. A variety of tracking strategies considering different transaction factors (i.e., frequency and amount) are proposed, and the corresponding random-walk based link predictions method are designed for evaluation. Our method gets explainable results from the experiments, demonstrating that both transaction frequency and amount influence the generation of new transactions in Ethereum. This means when tracking the money flow among Ethereum accounts, we should pay more attention to those transaction paths having a shorter time interval and a larger amount. From these transaction features, the proposed random-walk based link prediction framework is found to be an effective method for transaction tracking. Furthermore, we show an application of transaction tracking via link prediction effectively enhance the ability to detect the suspicious accounts in Ethereum.

963	实体经济	Blockchain Smart Contract to Prevent Forgery of Degree Certificates: Artificial Intelligence Consensus Algorithm	Certificates are often falsified, such as fake diplomas and forged transcripts. As such, many schools and educational institutions have begun to issue diplomas online. Although diplomas can be issued conveniently anytime, anywhere, there are many cases wherein diplomas are forged through hacking and forgery. This paper deals with the required Blockchain diploma. In addition, we use an automatic translation system, which incorporates natural language processing, to perform verification work that does not require an existing public certificate. The hash algorithm is used to authenticate security. This paper also proposes the use of these security protocols to provide more secure data protection. In addition, each transaction history, whether a diploma is true or not, may be different in length if it is presented in text, but converting it into a hash function means that it is always more than a certain length of SHA-512 or higher. It is then verified using the time stamp values. These chaining codes are designed. This paper also provides the necessary experimental environment. At least 10 nodes are constructed. Blockchain platform development applies and references Blockchain standardization, and a platform test, measurement test, and performance measurement test are conducted to assess the smart contract development and performance measurement. A total of 500 nodes were obtained by averaging 200 times, and a Blockchain-based diploma file was agreed upon at the same time. It shows performance information of about 4100 TPS. In addition, the analysis of artificial intelligence distribution diagram was conducted using a four-point method, and the distribution chart was evenly distributed, confirming the diploma with the highest similarity. The verified values were then analyzed. This paper proposes these natural language processing-based Blockchain algorithms.	blockchain;diploma certificates;deep learning;mooc;information securitysystem
964	实体经济	Smart contract based digital evidence management framework over blockchain for vehicle accident investigation in IoV era	Digital collection and maintenance of evidence corresponding to an accident is of utmost relevance as vehicles become connected and part of Internet of things ecosystem. A conceptual evidence management framework is proposed examining the future of accident investigation forensics in the era of connected vehicles. The framework discusses how evidence generated from vehicles involved in incident along with supporting evidence from nearby vehicles CCTVs and road users can be collected and managed over blockchain using smart contracts in a vehicle to everything connected environment. The management of evidence over blockchain serves as an immutable and auditable means to investigate and settle cases post an accident among the stakeholders. Dynamic access control over evidence data and reports based on location of incident and vehicle involved is implemented with the help of smart contracts. The cost of deploying and carrying out transactions using the smart contracts is evaluated over both public and private Ethereum blockchain. Mechanism and cost involved in storing evidence on chain versus off chain using Inter Planetary File System in most optimised manner saving memory and execution cost is compared and presented.

965	核心技术	LLAKEP: A Low-Latency Authentication and Key Exchange Protocol for Energy Internet of Things in the Metaverse Era	The authenticated key exchange (AKE) protocol can ensure secure communication between a client and a server in the electricity transaction of the Energy Internet of things (EIoT). Park proposed a two-factor authentication protocol 2PAKEP, whose computational burden of authentication is evenly shared by both sides. However, the computing capability of the client device is weaker than that of the server. Therefore, based on 2PAKEP, we propose an authentication protocol that transfers computational tasks from the client to the server. The client has fewer computing tasks in this protocol than the server, and the overall latency will be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the security of the proposed protocol is analyzed by using the ROR model and GNY logic. We verify the low-latency advantage of the proposed protocol through various comparative experiments and use it for EIoT electricity transaction systems in a Metaverse scenario.	eiot;low-latency;ake;security analysis;ror;gny logic;metaversescheme;secure
966	核心技术	PROBABILISTIC FRAMEWORK FOR LOSS DISTRIBUTION OF SMART CONTRACT RISK	Smart contract risk can be defined as a financial risk of loss due to cyber attacks on or contagious failures of smart contracts. Its quantification is of paramount importance to technology platform providers as well as companies and individuals when considering the deployment of this new technology. That is why, as our primary contribution, we propose a structural framework of aggregate loss distribution for smart contract risk under the assumption of a tree-stars graph topology representing the network of interactions among smart contracts and their users. To our knowledge, there exist no theoretical frameworks or models of an aggregate loss distribution for smart contracts in this setting. To achieve our goal, we contextualize the problem in the probabilistic graph-theoretical framework using bond percolation models. We assume that the smart contract network topology is represented by a random tree graph of finite size, and that each smart contract is the center of a random star graph whose leaves represent the users of the smart contract. We allow for heterogeneous loss topology superimposed on this smart contract and user topology and provide analytical results and instructive numerical examples.	smart contracts;cyber risk;operational risk;loss modeling;random graphs;insurance
967	核心技术	A Novel Optimization for GPU Mining Using Overclocking and Undervolting	Cryptography and associated technologies have existed for a long time. This field is advancing at a remarkable speed. Since the inception of its initial application, blockchain has come a long way. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT). The most well-known cryptocurrency for everyday use is Bitcoin, which debuted in 2008. Its success ushered in a digital revolution, and it currently provides security, decentralization, and a reliable data transport and storage mechanism to various industries and companies. Governments and developing enterprises seeking a competitive edge have expressed interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies due to the rapid growth of this recent technology. For computer experts and individuals looking for a method to supplement their income, cryptocurrency mining has become a big source of anxiety. Mining is a way of resolving mathematical problems based on the processing capacity and speed of the computers employed to solve them in return for the digital currency incentives. Herein, we have illustrated benefits of utilizing GPUs (graphical processing units) for cryptocurrency mining and compare two methods, namely overclocking and undervolting, which are the superior techniques when it comes to GPU optimization. The techniques we have used in this paper will not only help the miners to gain profits while mining cryptocurrency but also solve a major flaw; in order to mitigate the energy and resources that are consumed by the mining hardware, we have designed the mining hardware to simultaneously run longer and consume much less electricity. We have also compared our techniques with other popular techniques that are already in existence with respect to GPU mining.	cryptocurrency;blockchain;mining;graphical processing unitsenergy-consumption
968	实体经济	A Blockchain-Enabled Distributed Advanced Metering Infrastructure Secure Communication (BC-AMI)	The world is facing an urgent need to provide secure communication and data access control in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) because conventional cryptographic key management and authentication protocols are at stake. The cryptography schemes entirely rely on trusted third parties (TTPs), leading to a single point of failure and increasing network overhead. In response to this inefficiency and security compromise, this study proposes a blockchain-enabled distributed AMI secure communication scheme. In the proposed work, smart contract (SC), an integrated part of the blockchain, is programmed to substitute traditional TTP-based transaction systems, which operate in a distributed, immutable, and trustworthy manner. In this paper, we implemented practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain platform to ensure Byzantine fault tolerance in the blockchain transaction. Performance analysis shows that the proposed BC-AMI scheme has the advantage of incurring the least amount of communication and time costs compared with similar studies while ensuring security against some common cyber-attacks.	advanced metering infrastructure secure communication;smart contract;hyperledger fabric;practical byzantine fault tolerancescheme

Different types of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Tether do not depend on a central authority. Decision making is complicated by categorization and transmission of uncertainty, as well as verification of digital currency. The weighted average and weighted geometric aggregation operators are used in this article to define a multi-attribute decision-making approach. This work investigates the uniqueness of q-rung orthopair fuzzy hypersoft sets (q-ROFHSS), which respond to instabilities, uncertainty, ambiguity, and imprecise information. This research also covers some fundamental topics of q-ROFHSS. The model offered here is the best option for learning about electronic currency. This study validates the complexity of decision-making problems with different attributes and subattributes to obtain an optimal choice. We conclude that Bitcoin has a diverse set of applications and that crypto assets are well positioned to become an important asset class in decision making.	soft set

971	市场治理	To Incentivize or Not: Impact of Blockchain-Based Cryptoeconomic Tokens on Human Information Sharing Behavior	Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in the form of a randomized control trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design involving 132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens, individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information, such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective personalized incentives for sharing economies.	blockchain;cryptoeconomics;distributed ledger technology;incentives;information sharing;self-determination theory;token economics;token engineeringintrinsic motivation;design science;knowledge;normality;economics;system;trust

The study of technical analysis in cryptocurrencies has largely ignored the implications of often high transaction costs and bubble periods on trade rule performance. We study the daily and 1 -minute returns of 69 technical trade rules in the form of moving average and breakout strategies, with and without transaction costs, during price bubbles in the 2016-2021 period. For the most profitable trade rules, we find that bubble periods increase the likelihood that Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin beat buy-and-hold, but not Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

975	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based Financial Instrument for the Decarbonization of Irrigated Agriculture	Farming and food production sustainability increasingly depends on the availability of a clean energy model for irrigated agriculture. This can be achieved by massively introducing photovoltaic irrigation systems (PVI) with sufficient quality and reliability. Nevertheless, such PVI projects require high upfront investment and long payback times, so access to long-term, low-cost capital is essential to ensure their competitiveness. In this regard, decentralized financial (DeFi) solutions based on blockchain (BC) technology present a number of features that can be applied to produce financial instruments (FI) well suited to attract investors to PVI projects and to reduce the cost of clean energy for irrigators. In order to assess such a possibility, a DeFi FI tailored for PVI has been produced and implemented in BC. We demonstrate that a single smart contract executed in a distributed ledger can execute the different tasks related to the securitization of PVI assets. The impact on the cost of capital for PVI projects is significant, leading to an estimated reduction in the cost of clean energy for irrigators of 22%. Nevertheless, decentralization also introduces a number of specific risks that must be considered and mitigated.	blockchain securitization;decentralized finance;green bonds;photovoltaic irrigation;power purchase agreement;financial instrument;energy model of agriculture;on-farm renewable energy
976	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Gas Auctioning Coupled with a Novel Economic Dispatch Formulation for Gas-Deficient Thermal Plants	Inadequate gas supply is partly responsible for the energy shortfall experienced in some energy-poor nations. Favorable market conditions would boost investment in the gas supply sector; hence, we propose a blockchain-based fair, transparent, and secure gas trading scheme that facilitates peer-to-peer trading of gas. The scheme is developed using an Ethereum-based smart contract that receives offers from gas suppliers and bid(s) from the thermal plant operator. Giving priority to the cheapest offers, the smart contract determines the winning suppliers. This paper also proposes an economic dispatch model for gas-deficient plants. Conventional economic dispatch seeks to satisfy electric load demand whilst minimizing the total gas cost of generating units. Implicit in its formulation is the assumption that gas supply to generating units is sufficient to satisfy available demand. In energy poor nations, this is hardly the case as there is often inadequate gas supply and conventional economic dispatch is of little practical value. The proposed economic dispatch model's objective function maximizes the quantity of available gas and determines the optimal power output of each generating unit. The mathematical formulation is verified using data from the Egbin thermal station which is the largest thermal station in Nigeria and is solved using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). Obtained results indicate the viability of the novel approach as it results in a net power gain of 35 MW. On the other hand, the smart contract proved effective in accurately selecting winning suppliers and making payment.	economic dispatch;gams;blockchain;ethereum;smart contractemission dispatch;energy;model;management
977	实体经济	Research on Financial Development of Water Resources Enterprises Based on Blockchain Technology	From the perspective of economics, blockchain is simply an Internet, which can meet the needs of the sharing economy to a certain extent. With the development of the world, blockchain technology has developed in an explosive growth. At present, the systematic research on blockchain technology at home and abroad is still in its initial stage, mainly focusing on the application prospect, especially in the fields of traditional finance and digital currency. The development of environmentally friendly water resources enterprises has the support background of the country, and the financial impact of blockchain technology also affects environmentally friendly water resources enterprises. In order to explore the development of blockchain technology in water resources protection, based on the advantages and application status of blockchain technology, this paper firstly constructs a supply chain financial system model of water resources enterprises based on blockchain and secondly analyzes the financial environment of seven water enterprises in China by constructing a financial environment evaluation model. The results show that Chongqing Water has the highest target degree of 0.76 and target level of 3, indicating that the enterprise has good adaptability and maintains the stability of financial environment under the influence of blockchain technology. Furthermore, the asset valuation of Chongqing Water is analyzed by Monte Carlo method. The results show that, under the blockchain financial model, the fierce competition in the wealth management products market will make issuers lose their dominant position in pricing and reduce profits in order to attract investors.	
978	核心技术	Ethereum's Peer-to-Peer Network Monitoring and Sybil Attack Prevention	Public blockchains, like Ethereum, rely on an underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) network to disseminate transactions and blocks between nodes. With the rise of blockchain applications and cryptocurrencies values, they have become critical infrastructures which still lack comprehensive studies. In this paper, we propose to investigate the reliability of the Ethereum P2P network. We developed our own dependable crawler to collect information about the peers composing the network. Our data analysis regarding the geographical distribution of peers and the churn rate shows good network properties while the network can exhibit a sudden and major increase in size and peers are highly concentrated on a few ASes. In a second time, we investigate suspicious patterns that can denote a Sybil attack. We find that many nodes hold numerous identities in the network and could become a threat. To mitigate future Sybil attacks, we propose an architecture to detect suspicious nodes and revoke them. It is based on a monitoring system, a smart contract to propagate the information and an external revocation tool to help clients remove their connections to suspicious peers. Our experiment on Ethereum's Test network proved that our solution is effective.	blockchain;security;network measurement;distributed hash tablekad
979	核心技术	Revisiting FAW attack in an imperfect PoW blockchain system	Malicious miners in a Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain can apply less computing power to perform fork-after-withholding (FAW) attack than that to selfish mining and other withholding attacks. Quantitative study of FAW attack enables an in-depth understanding of the attack and then helps design countermeasures. The existing quantification studies of FAW attack only considered a perfect Bitcoin blockchain, where there is no block propagation delay. This paper aims to quantitatively investigate FAW attack in imperfect Bitcoin and Ethereum systems. We first establish an analytic model to capture the chain dynamics under FAW attack in a PoW system where the longest-chain protocol is used. Then the model is explored to derive closed-formed metric formulas for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. These closed-formed formulas enable the evaluation of both the profitability of FAW adversaries and the impact of FAW attack on system throughput. Experimental results reveal that FAW adversaries can get more revenue in the network with propagation delay than without delay. FAW attack can reduce the blockchain throughput, especially in Bitcoin.	bitcoin;ethereum;fork after withholding attack;proof-of-work;quantitative analysisbitcoin
980	实体经济	Blockchain Empowered Smart Home: A Scalable Architecture for Sustainable Smart Cities	Emerging growth in technology has rapidly changed our homes and cities. Present homes and cities will be upgraded to smart homes and smart cities in the near future. Various solutions used to build the smart-city network demand a scalable and decentralized solution. This study proposes a blockchain-empowered decentralized and scalable solution for a sustainable smart-city network. The Internet of Things (IoT), fog nodes, permissioned trust chain, smart contract, blockchain, and InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) are deployed to construct a scalable and decentralized solution for a sustainable smart city. Three main public sector departments, i.e., electricity, water supply, and health care, are studied over the proposed solution. The proposed solution is implemented over constrained application protocol (CoAP) and Ethereum blockchain. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for 1500 devices and over 10,000 records. A total 77.44% improvement is registered during performance evaluation over a scalable environment. The performance evaluation of each case study and collaborative performance evaluation concludes the improvised performance of the proposed solution for scalable and distributed applications. Better performance, scalability, and the distributed nature of the presented model make it suitable for the sustainable smart-city network.	blockchain;sustainable smart city;internet of things (iot);smart home;smart contract;sensors and fog computingcloud;internet;things;integration
981	核心技术	A Survey of Blockchain Data Management Systems	Blockchain has been widely deployed in various fields, such as finance, education, and public services. Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems.	data management;blockchain architecture;blockchain data structure;blockchain storage enginesecurity;internet;scheme

Evidence from metaverse LAND transactions*	LAND is a non-fungible token (NFT) representing virtual real estate ownership in The Sandbox metaverse, a digital world built on the Ethereum blockchain. The open nature of a blockchainbased metaverses like The Sandbox allows users to transact in multiple denominations/currencies. We analyze more than 71,000 transactions and find that when transactions are settled in The Sandbox's native utility token (SAND), users pay 3.4% more compared to ETH (in effective USD prices). There are also evidences that users pay less when transactions are settled in wETH and USD-pegged stablecoins (USDC). Thus, the cryptocurrency/token settlement choice (i.e., unit of account) matters for willingness to pay.	metaverse;nft;unit of account;willingness to pay
983	虚拟经济	Incorporating Registration, Reputation, and Incentivization Into the NFT Ecosystem	Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have recently received immense popularity in the digital art industry. An NFT represents ownership of a unique item that is stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed, replaced, and copied. The current NFT ecosystem falls short in trust features and is prone to illegitimate users, threats, and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for the NFT ecosystem that incorporates registration of the participating actors, involves a decentralized reputation system, provides incentives to its users through rewards, and penalizes misconduct. Our system design is built to ensure trust and credibility in the NFT ecosystem. The proposed solution leverages blockchain's intrinsic security features such as transparency, tamper-proof logs, data integrity, accountability, and non-repudiation. We use the decentralized storage of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store the NFTs' metadata, whereas their hash is stored on the chain. We present algorithms along with their implementation, testing, and validation details. We demonstrate how our solution, as well as smart contract code, is secure enough against common security threats and attacks. We make our smart contract code publicly available on the GitHub repository.	nonfungible tokens;security;smart contracts;ecosystems;standards;codes;metadata;nfts;nftm;blockchain;reputation;staking;incentives;ipfs;ethereum;smart contracts;trust;securitydecentralized reputation;blockchain;system;trust
984	实体经济	Detecting model misconducts in decentralized healthcare federated learning	Background: To accelerate healthcare/genomic medicine research and facilitate quality improvement, researchers have started cross-institutional collaborations to use artificial intelligence on clinical/genomic data. However, there are real-world risks of incorrect models being submitted to the learning process, due to either unforeseen accidents or malicious intent. This may reduce the incentives for institutions to participate in the federated modeling consortium. Existing methods to deal with this "model misconduct" issue mainly focus on modifying the learning methods, and therefore are more specifically tied with the algorithm. Basic Procedures: In this paper, we aim at solving the problem in an algorithm-agnostic way by (1) designing a simulator to generate various types of model misconduct, (2) developing a framework to detect the model misconducts, and (3) providing a generalizable approach to identify model misconducts for federated learning. We considered the following three categories: Plagiarism, Fabrication, and Falsification, and then developed a detection framework with three components: Auditing, Coefficient, and Performance detectors, with greedy parameter tuning. Main Findings: We generated 10 types of misconducts from models learned on three datasets to evaluate our detection method. Our experiments showed high recall with low added computational cost. Our proposed detection method can best identify the misconduct on specific sites from any learning iteration, whereas it is more challenging to precisely detect misconducts for a specific site and at a specific iteration. Principal Conclusions: We anticipate our study can support the enhancement of the integrity and reliability of federated machine learning on genomic/healthcare data.	model misconducts;federated learning;predictive modeling;electronic health record;blockchain distributed ledger technologypropagation logistic-regression;blockchain
985	协同技术	Blockchained service provisioning and malicious node detection via federated learning in scalable Internet of Sensor Things networks	In this paper, a blockchained Beyond Fifth Generation (B5G) enabled malicious node detection model is proposed for the Internet of Sensor Things (IoSTs). Moreover, a secure service provisioning scheme using cascading encryption and feature evaluation process is also proposed for the IoSTs. The presence of malicious nodes causes severe issues in the localization and service provisioning, which discourages new entities to join the network. Therefore, it is very important to establish trust between all entities by detecting and removing such nodes. The proposed B5G enabled malicious node detection model uses federated learning for the detection of malicious nodes. The federated learning uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to detect the malicious nodes. The malicious nodes are classified on the bases of their honesty and end-to-end delay. Moreover, the service provider nodes provide services to each other and get the reward. However, the service provisioning in the IoSTs has many issues like a repudiation of service providers as well as the clients. The feature evaluation and cascading encryption mechanisms are used to solve these issues. The digital signature in cascading encryption ensures the non-repudiation of the service provider. On the other hand, feature evaluation of service ensures that the client cannot repudiate about actually demanded services. Moreover, the conformance of services is also ensured by the feature evaluation process. The simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed non-repudiation model. The SVM and RF classifiers are compared in terms of accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall. The accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of SVM are 79%, 1, 0.8795 and 0.78, respectively. On the other hand, the accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of RF classifier are 95%, 0.92, 0.96 and 1, respectively. The results show that RF has better accuracy than RF in malicious nodes detection.	beyond fifth generation;blockchain;cascading encryption;internet of sensor things;localization;non-repudiation;random forest algorithm;service provisioning;support vector machinearchitecture;system

987	实体经济	Federated learning for malware detection in IoT devices	Billions of IoT devices lacking proper security mechanisms have been manufactured and deployed for the last years, and more will come with the development of Beyond 5G technologies. Their vulnerability to malware has motivated the need for efficient techniques to detect infected IoT devices inside networks. With data privacy and integrity becoming a major concern in recent years, increasing with the arrival of 5G and Beyond networks, new technologies such as federated learning and blockchain emerged. They allow training machine learning models with decentralized data while preserving its privacy by design. This work investigates the possibilities enabled by federated learning concerning IoT malware detection and studies security issues inherent to this new learning paradigm. In this context, a framework that uses federated learning to detect malware affecting IoT devices is presented. N-BaIoT, a dataset modeling network traffic of several real IoT devices while affected by malware, has been used to evaluate the proposed framework. Both supervised and unsupervised federated models (multi-layer perceptron and autoencoder) able to detect malware affecting seen and unseen IoT devices of N-BaIoT have been trained and evaluated. Furthermore, their performance has been compared to two traditional approaches. The first one lets each participant locally train a model using only its own data, while the second consists of making the participants share their data with a central entity in charge of training a global model. This comparison has shown that the use of more diverse and large data, as done in the federated and centralized methods, has a considerable positive impact on the model performance. Besides, the federated models, while preserving the participant's privacy, show similar results as the centralized ones. As an additional contribution and to measure the robustness of the federated approach, an adversarial setup with several malicious participants poisoning the federated model has been considered. The baseline model aggregation averaging step used in most federated learning algorithms appears highly vulnerable to different attacks, even with a single adversary. The performance of other model aggregation functions acting as countermeasures is thus evaluated under the same attack scenarios. These functions provide a significant improvement against malicious participants, but more efforts are still needed to make federated approaches robust.	iot security;federated learning;iot device;botnet detection;adversarial attackdataset
988	实体经济	A Mutual Authentication and Cross Verification Protocol for Securing Internet-of-Drones (IoD)	With the rapid miniaturization in sensor technology, Internet-of-Drones (IoD) has delighted researchers towards information transmission security among drones with the control station server (CSS). In IoD, the drone is different in shapes, sizes, characteristics, and configurations. It can be classified on the purpose of its deployment, either in the civilian ormilitary domain. Drone's manufacturing, equipment installation, power supply, multi-rotor system, and embedded sensors are not issues for researchers. The main thing is to utilize a drone for a complex and sensitive task using an infrastructureless/self-organization/resource-less network type called Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET). Monitoring data transmission traffic, emergency and rescue operations, border surveillance, search and physical phenomenon sensing, and so on can be achieved by developing a robust mutual authentication and cross-verification scheme for IoD deployment civilian drones. Although several protocols are available in the literature, they are either design issues or suffering from other vulnerabilities; still, no one claims with conviction about foolproof security mechanisms. Therefore, in this paper, the researchers highlighted themajor deficits in prior protocols of the domain, i.e., these protocols are either vulnerable to forgery, side channel, stolen-verifier attacks, or raised the outdated data transmission flaw. In order to overcome these loopholes and provide a solution to the existing vulnerabilities, this paper proposed an improved and robust public key infrastructure (PKI) based authentication scheme for the IoD environment. The proposed protocol's security analysis section has been conducted formally using BAN (Burrows-Abadi-Needham) logic, ProVerif2.03 simulation, and informally using discussion/pragmatic illustration. While the performance analysis section of the paper has been assessed by considering storage, computation, and communication cost. Upon comparing the proposed protocol with prior works, it has been demonstrated that it is efficient and effective and recommended for practical implementation in the IoD environment.	cryptography;authentication;confidentiality;reachability;zspkey agreement scheme;lightweight authentication;blockchain;framework;safety

990	实体经济	Blockchain-based security in smart grid network	The cybersecurity threats in the smart grid network are prominent with conventional approaches providing integrated security control and communication protection for smart grids that are vulnerable to some types of attacks and limit their use in real-time applications. In this study, the statistical function predicts the system performance of the future timestamp and compares it with the actual performance to detect the attack. The asymmetric encryption function is used to find the user authentication, which is complex and increases the network latency. In this paper, a blockchain-based methodology is proposed for cybersecurity threat detection in smart grid networks without increasing the network latency. The proposed model is based on blockchain-based secure user authentication, lightweight data encryption and quantum key distribution multi-constraint-based edge selection, bi-fold intrusion detection system, and optimal user privacy management. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed model is 98%.	smart grid;intrusion detection system;blockchain;quantum key distribution;qkdlightweight authentication scheme;intrusion detection;system;framework;privacy;attacks
991	虚拟经济	Stablecoins: Classification, functional features and development prospects	The article is devoted to stablecoins and their prospects for use in the financial market. The authors propose the interpretation and classification of stablecoins and analyze their functional features and development prospects. Also impact of the global economic crisis on stablecoins is analyzed. The findings illustrated that stablecoins differ from traditional electronic money, as well as classic cryptocurrencies, and they can be interpreted as hybrid digital financial assets. Currently, the commonest digital coins with a stable rate are local stablecoins with backing. At the same time, both in terms of capitalization and transaction volume, dominated by centralized fiat-backed and gold-backed stablecoins. Decentralized non-backed stablecoins are not widespread, despite a number of technological innovations that may underlie their stabilization mechanism. The authors have identified main scenarios for the use of local and global stablecoins in the near future. It was observed that at a time of decreased volatility stablecoins are currently predominantly used as a tool to minimize the risk of price volatility in the crypto-assets market. In contrast, the growing interest in applying of global stablecoins under the new reduction volatility mechanisms, may encourage the extensive use of stablecoins in both retail and wholesale payments at the international level. In addition, the development of global stablecoins may entail risks to financial stability and the functioning of monetary systems, to minimize which it is necessary to develop a regulatory framework and financial procedures that take into account the possibility of a wide circulation of stablecoins.	stablecoins;crypto-assets;virtual currency;distributed ledger technology;collateral stablecoins;algorithmic stablecoins;local stablecoins;global stablecoins
992	实体经济	Secured SDN Based Blockchain: An Architecture to Improve the Security of VANET	Vehicular Ad-hoc networks (VANETs) during the communication process, nodes are always varying and the process is always under security threats like Sybil attacks, masquerading attacks, etc. In order to reduce the probability of these attacks and to regulate traffic flow in the network, a software-defined network (SON) is used. The SON is used for implementing protocols like OpenFlow and reducing the routing load in the network, but it doesn't provide a high level of security to the network, hence protocols like encryption, hashing, etc. are applied to the VANET. In the paper, SDN based blockchain-inspired algorithm is implemented, which coordinates network traffic and improves the overall security of the network. Security analysis of the proposed algorithm shows that the combination of blockchain with encrypted SDN is removing more than 95% of the network attacks as compared to its non-blockchain counterparts.	vehicular ad-hoc network;software-defined networks;encryption algorithm;network security;blockchainscheme
993	核心技术	RePEL: Blockchain-Empowered Conditional Privacy-Preserving Encrypted Learning	Business organization performs its business activities within a headquarter-branch relationship, especially for multinationals, by establishing work places in accordance with business requirements. The data-driven decision making stimulates the importance of data analysis. Machine learning (ML), as a method of data analysis, automates analytical model building based on the idea that systems can train and learn from data to make decisions with minimal human intervention. For high accuracy, traditional ML algorithms make design tradeoffs, conceding privacy and reliability, and are thereby unable to satisfy strong security demands. To resolve design tensions, in this article, we propose RePEL, which harmonizes functional encryption (FE) and blockchain on top of encrypted learning. RePEL allows the headquarter to only share partial information about business data collected from branches while manages data transfer with the consensus mechanism in the blockchain, which works in a coordinated way for preserving conditional privacy and high reliability. We instantiate a RePEL design with the three-layer framework and formally reduce its security to a provably secure FE scheme. We further deploy Feel_BC to implement a RePEL prototype system, so as to realize the performance evaluation. Experimental results show that RePEL, with the basic premise of privacy and reliability, can achieve high accuracy and reasonable throughputs.	blockchains;cryptography;business;reliability;iron;data privacy;data analysis;blockchain;conditional privacy;functional encryption (fe);machine learning (ml) over encrypted datainternet;things;iot
994	核心技术	BigFooT: A robust optimal-latency BFT blockchain consensus protocol with dynamic validator membership	Permissioned blockchains are blockchains where only a finite and known subset of all the nodes, that we call validator set, is allowed to propose the next block to be added to the blockchain maintained by each node. In this work, we present BigFooT, a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocol for permissioned blockchains that draws upon the State Machine Replication (SMR) protocols Zyzzyva and Spinning to ensure the following properties: (i) Correct operation under eventual synchrony provided that less than one third of the validators are Byzantine even if the maximum message latency of the network after reaching synchrony is unknown; (ii) Dynamic membership of the validator set; (iii) Latency of only two message delays for deciding on a block once the network reaches synchrony provided that the maximum message latency is known and all validators are honest; (iv) Resilience to Byzantine performance degradation; (v) Resilience to messages being lost before the network becomes synchronous. To the best of our knowledge, BigFooT is the first blockchain consensus protocol that ensures all these combined properties. Additionally, we show for the first time how a vanilla implementation of state machine reconfiguration protocols to achieve a dynamic validator set can produce a protocol that fails to guarantee liveness.	blockchain;byzantine fault tolerant;reconfiguration
995	实体经济	BCSDN-IoT: Towards an IoT security architecture based on SDN and Blockchain	The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to create a digital world where any information system can expose, discover, understand and consume data and services for analysis, diagnosis, decision support and task automation in various domains such as healthcare, transportation, energy, industry, agriculture, etc. Faced with this diversity of applications and rapid evolution, infrastructures must be able to achieve high levels of security and confidentiality while being open, sustainable, and agile to adapt to the multiple requirements of applications. To meet these needs, new paradigms are emerging. These include the Software Defined Networks (SDN) paradigm, which offers the ability to dynamically program different applications and devices to provide end-to-end service chains. In parallel, the Blockchain paradigm is increasingly used in the Internet of Things, making distributed transactions between connected objects such as financial transactions or "smart contracts" possible. Although the combination of these two paradigms (Blockchain/SDN) is a major issue for the success of the Internet of Things, paving the way for new business models and management/control of communication networks, there is not yet a specified/formalized architecture allowing the use of the "Blockchain" in SDN. In this research, a new architecture for a system combining blockchain and SDN for IoT security is proposed.	internet of things (iot);software-defined networking (sdn);openflow;blockchain;bcsdn-iot architectureinternet

997	实体经济	CROWD-BASED OPEN INNOVATION IN TELCO OPERATORS: READINESS ASSESSMENT FOR SMART CITY SERVICE DEVELOPMENT	This paper studies the readiness of the Serbian telco operators and other stakeholders to implement a crowd-based open innovation business model. Telco companies are facing challenges in terms of market demands and with finding new opportunities to attract subscribers with innovative products and services. These innovations are frequently oriented towards smart city services based on emerging technologies such as Internet of things, cloud computing, software defined networks and blockchain. Due to complexity, pace and costs of research and development, telco operators have already recognized the need to shift from a traditional to an open innovation concept. The development of crowdsourcing models has further fueled the possibility to include customers in the open innovation process, in order to better design and develop services suited to their own needs. With this in mind, the goal of this paper is to propose a crowd-based open innovation business model for improvement of innovation capacities of Serbian telco operators. The proposed model is used as the basis of evaluating the readiness of internal and external stakeholders for participation in open innovation projects. The study is based on the adjusted value-based adoption model, while the analysis is performed using the PLS-SEM method. The results show that participants identify trust as the most influential factor for the perceived value of crowd-based open innovation, while the internal stakeholders of telco companies find expected income and reputation as the most relevant. Both groups have shown a high interest in innovations related to smart city services such as smart traffic and ecology-related services.	telco industry;open innovation;crowd-based business models;smart cities

1000	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based Human-to-Infrastructure Contact Tracing Approach for COVID-19	In a post-pandemic era with personal precautions and vaccination, the emergence of COVID-19 variants with higher transmissibility and the socio-economic reopening have raised new challenges to existing human-to-human digital contact tracing systems, where privacy, efficiency, and energy-consumption issues are major concerns. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-based human-to-infrastructure contact tracing framework for the post-pandemic era. Specifically, our approach collects and records the interaction information between persons and predeployed anchor nodes to trace the possible contacts with confirmed patients, so as to capture the indirect contacts and reduces the energy consumption of users. To address the privacy leakage and reliability issues in contact tracing, we introduce a self-sovereign identity (SSI) model-based blockchain which enables users to gain full control of their own identities and eliminate the linkage between the identity and location information in interaction records. To further preserve the privacy of confirmed patients, we introduce the private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocol to estimate the risk of infection by only counting the number of encounters between users and confirmed patients. Two self-executed smart contracts are deployed on the SSI blockchain to perform contact tracing, which guarantees the robustness of the system. The performance analysis validates the effectiveness of our approach.	privacy;bluetooth;blockchains;covid-19;protocols;servers;global positioning system;blockchain;covid-19;digital contact tracing;privacy-preserving;self-sovereign identity (ssi) model
1001	实体经济	Automating governance: Blockchain delivered governance for business networks	This conceptual article seeks to integrate blockchain into current theory on the governance of interorganizational exchanges within business networks. It posits that a blockchain governance structure comprised of administrative, platform, and application level mechanisms represents a significant new antecedent and causal factor determining the extent of the need for the traditional contractual and relational mechanisms of governance. Further, that blockchain delivered governance can perform the functions of transaction coordination and safeguarding which are required in order to substitute for those traditional mechanisms of governance. A discussion points the way towards empirical verification of the framework created, and towards avenues for further theoretical research, and examines the implications of blockchain delivered governance for practitioners. In developing this framework, this article also seeks to make a contribution by placing attention on the need for the building of theory applying to blockchain, and for quantitative measurement of the effects of blockchain on organizations and business networks. This article concludes that the emergence of blockchain technology now provides the means by which automation of the specification, validation, and enforcement of private ordering between exchange participants can be achieved, and that this should stimulate a reevaluation of existing theories of inter-organizational governance.	blockchain;distributed ledger technology;smart contracts;governance;relational governance;contractual governance;business networksrelational governance;research framework;supply chain;contract;trust;performance;organizations;coordination;challenges;benefits
1002	协同技术	Paillier Cryptosystem Based ChainNode for Secure Electronic Voting	Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger of transactions that are linked together cryptographically leading to immutability and tamper-resistance, thereby ensuring the integrity of data. Due to the ability of blockchain to guarantee the integrity of data, it has found wide-range adoption in electronic voting (e-voting) systems in recent years, this is in a bid to prevent manipulation of votes. However, due to the distributed nature of the blockchain, opportunities arise for privacy intrusion of the data being secured. The translation of this privacy flaw in blockchain to e-voting systems is the possibility of violation of the privacy of the electorates. Consequently, in a bid to achieve integrity and privacy of votes in e-voting, this study presents the use of an open-source blockchain system, coupled with a privacy-oriented cryptosystem known as the Paillier cryptosystem, towards addressing the privacy concerns of the blockchain. The performance of the system was evaluated and a transaction throughput of 1424 tps was obtained for ten thousand simulated ballot transactions. Further evaluation was carried out on the system, by increasing the number of system transactions. This showed that the mining time of the blockchain increased by an average factor of 0.18 s for every thousand increases in the number of transactions. Also, the response time of the system to a range of user actions was evaluated over an increasing number of voters. Results obtained showed that the response time of the system for vote casting operations increased by an average of 0.33 min per thousand voters while for vote tallying there was an increase in response time by an average of 0.848 min per thousand voters. The scientific value of this study is the development of an integrity and privacy-preserving e-voting system consisting of an open-source nodechain coupled with a privacy-oriented cryptosystem known as the Paillier cryptosystem following the security requirements of e-voting systems. The proposed system addresses the issue of integrity in e-voting while still maintaining the privacy of the electorates.	e-voting;blockchain;homomorphic encryption;proof-of-work;ballotblockchain;privacy;system
1003	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based Verifiable User Data Access Control Policy for Secured Cloud Data Storage	Adding the adequate level of security of information systems dealing with sensitive data, privacy, or defense systems involves some form of access control. The audits performed are dealing with the determination of the allowed activities of the legal users, when attempting to access resources of the system. Usually, full access is provided after the user has been successfully authenticated through an authentication mechanism (e.g., password), while the corresponding authorization control is based on the confidentiality level of the respective resources and the authorization level assigned to each user. A very important diversification occurring in modern digital technologies is related to the identification based on blockchain technology, which is presented as a public, distributed data series, unable to modify its history and grouped in time-numbered blocks. In this work, a blockchain-based verifiable user data access control policy for secured cloud data storage is suggested for a version associated with big data in health care. It is an innovative system of applying classified access policies to secure resources in the cloud, which operates based on blockchain technology.

Security of Patient's Electronic Medical Record (EMR) in Hospital Management System is of paramount importance and so warrants immediate attention. In this research work, BlockChain containers running on multiple ports are proposed to be used for holding patient's medical records. To perform this task effectively, a BlockChain framework named as "Medichain" was developed from scratch that contains all basic functionalities of a BlockChain to secure patient's data. Each block of the BlockChain keeps a list of records of patient details. Users would be provided with an option of uploading the file containing the list of records as a JSON file, in a decisive, distributed and decentralized network. The proposed BlockChain Algorithm, consisting of cryptographic hash of the records, proof of work and a Merkle tree formulation, were simulated in Python. Results have been positive and encouraging.

1005	实体经济	A Review on Security Issues and Solutions of the Internet of Drones	The Internet of Drones (IoD) has attracted increasing attention in recent years because of its portability and automation, and is being deployed in a wide range of fields (e.g., military, rescue and entertainment). Nevertheless, as a result of the inherently open nature of radio transmission paths in the IoD, data collected, generated or handled by drones is plagued by many security concerns. Since security and privacy are among the foremost challenges for the IoD, in this paper we conduct a comprehensive review on security issues and solutions for IoD security, discussing IoD-related security requirements and identifying the latest advancement in IoD security research. This review analyzes a host of important security technologies with emphases on authentication techniques and blockchain-powered schemes. Based on a detailed analysis, we present the challenges faced by current methodologies and recommend future IoD security research directions. This review shows that appropriate security measures are needed to address IoD security issues, and that newly designed security solutions should particularly consider the balance between the level of security and cost efficiency.	drones;security;privacy;crops;smart cities;computer architecture;agriculture;authentication;blockchain;internet of drones (iod);privacy;securityaircraft systems drones;iot-enabled internet;key agreement scheme;blockchain;authentication;privacy;challenges;search;things

1007	市场治理	Macroeconomic Forecast Model System Based on Digital Information and Blockchain Technology	Since the reform and opening up, China's economy has developed rapidly, becoming the second largest economy in the world. The state of macroeconomic development has a great influence on the government's policy introduction and the investment decisions of individual institutions. Therefore, forecasting the macroeconomy is of great significance to the country. This paper aims to study the macroeconomic forecasting model system based on digital information and blockchain technology. This paper proposes an artificial neural network prediction algorithm based on digital information and blockchain technology, and the artificial neural network and particle swarm algorithm are combined to become the hybrid artificial neural network algorithm, and the conception of the establishment of the macroeconomic forecast model is proposed. The experimental results of this paper show that according to the prediction results of artificial neural network, the prediction and actual error in 2010 is 0.10, while the new method proposed in this paper predicts the error of 0.056. In 2016, the prediction error based on artificial neural network was 0.14, while the prediction result of the new method proposed in this paper showed an error of 0.008. In each year's economic forecast, the neural network model of the new method proposed in this paper has higher prediction accuracy and smaller error. It can be seen that the neural network model based on artificial neural network and PSO algorithm proposed in this paper is beneficial to macroeconomic forecasting.	health-care;industry

The results of QQR analysis reveal that the effect of investors' mood on herd investing behavior is asymmetric and regime specific with a (weaker)higher (anti)herding tendency towards sad (happy) quantiles of investors' mood. The results provide support to the portfolio managers by documenting that investors' mood can be used as a signal to monitor the possible speculative activities in crypto market.	cryptocurrencies;herding behavior;happiness index;investors' mood;quantile-on-quantile regressionbehavior;sentiment

Besides location and scale parameters, the distribution has three shape parameters with many sub-models as special cases. Its parameters can be estimated by non-linear regression with parameter significance verification and sub-model testing. The applicability of this family of novel distributions is verified on returns of three cryptocurrencies and its suitability is tested by chi(2) goodness of fit testing. The obtained results show that this novel distribution and its sub-models can be viable candidates for modeling the returns of cryptocurrencies.	generalized gamma distribution;regularization;parameter estimation;logarithmic returns;cryptocurrencies
1010	市场治理	Relationship between Enterprise Financing Structure and Business Performance Assisted by Blockchain for Internet of Things Financing Mode	Financing structure is an important and very complex issue in the financial theory and the rights and obligations of relevant stakeholders of enterprises are also concentrated in the financing structure. Therefore, the financing structure has a significant impact on the value of enterprises. A reasonable financing structure is conducive to standardizing the behavior of enterprises and improving the value of enterprises. The change of corporate financing structure is often used as a signal to external investors about the company's future income expectations, especially because the financing structure has a certain impact on the company's performance, which makes the problem of financing structure more valued by the theoretical and financial circles. For the empirical information about company financing, this paper explores the influencing elements of the company's running overall performance assisted with the aid of the blockchain, and the net of matters provides a chain model and constructs the operating performance indicators according to the comprehensive score. We select the commercial credit financing rate, short-term loan financing rate, long-term loan financing rate, debt financing rate, equity financing rate, and endogenous financing rate. The control variables are total capital, ownership concentration, and average age of the company. The conclusion is drawn by regression analysis. Commercial savings financing rate, fairness financing fee, and endogenous financing fee are positively correlated with the working performance; short-term loans and average age of the company are negatively correlated with the operating performance; and long-term loan financing rate, bond financing rate, and equity concentration are not significantly correlated with the operating performance.	
1011	市场治理	Market efficiency and volatility within and across cryptocurrency benchmark indexes	With initial coin offerings and token offerings remaining at the forefront of alternative investments, the study of peer groups can be important for comparing investors' tastes and preferences for particular classes of cryptocurrency on a more equal footing. The aim of this paper is to identify violations of the weak-form market efficiency hypothesis for comparable cryptoassets that are conditional on market segmentation and those conditional on benchmarks. We use daily frequency data of 57 cryptocurrencies that account for more than 90% of the total market capitalization (market cap). We construct seven thematic market cap indexes that are able to represent the whole cryptocurrency universe. Against this background, we test for the presence of four empirical anomalies: risk premium, leverage, regime switch and calendar effects, both across and within these benchmark indexes. The main results support the existence of a switch between two states and positive excess returns toward the end of the week for both cases. Our methodology and findings contribute to the emerging literature on introducing active and passive portfolio management strategies that track benchmark crypto indexes.	cryptocurrencies;volatility clustering;risk;alternative investments;market efficiencytime-series;returns;inefficiency;prices
1012	实体经济	Fairness analysis of extra-gain guilty of a non-repudiation protocol	Many traditional applications can be refined thanks to the development of blockchain technology. One of these services is non-repudiation, in which participants in a communication process cannot deny their involvement. Due to the vulnerabilities of the non-repudiation protocols, one of the parties involved in the communication can often avoid non-repudiation rules and obtain the expected information to the detriment of the interests of the other party, resulting in adverse effects. This paper studies the fairness guarantee quantitatively through probabilistic model checking. E-fairness is measured by modeling the protocol in probabilistic timed automata and verifying the appropriate property specified in the probabilistic computation tree logic. Furthermore, our analysis proposes insight for choosing suitable values for different parameters associated with the protocol so that a certain degree of fairness can be obtained. Therefore, the reverse question-for a certain degree of fairness epsilon, how can the protocol parameters be specified to ensure fairness-is answered.	non-repudiation;fairness analysis;probabilistic model checking;prism;tp301;2blockchain
1013	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Neural Network Model for Agricultural Product Cold Chain Coordination	This paper adopts a blockchain fusion neural network algorithm to conduct an in-depth study on the model of agricultural cold chain coordination. We aim to enable HDFS to meet the demand of storing many small files of various types generated by various stages of agricultural cold chain coordination and then propose an improved balanced merging and index caching strategy based on file types and size grouping. The main three modules are the file preprocessing module, file balanced merging module, and index caching module. The experimental results show that this method can significantly improve the overall performance of HDFS when storing and reading large amounts of small files. Simulation experiments using the UCI test dataset show that the improved spectral clustering algorithm not only reduces the error rate but also significantly reduces the time spent on the clustering process, demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility of the improved spectral clustering algorithm. The improved spectral clustering algorithm of this paper is used to cluster and analyze nearly one thousand cold chain coordination-related data, and the optimal city is successfully selected as the construction point of a large cold storage transit station. This study can effectively improve the efficiency of cold chain coordination resources and their time utilization and maximize the profit creation for cold chain coordination enterprises, selecting data features for prediction, experimenting with different models and parameters to optimize accuracy, and embedding the resulting learning system for prediction and further operations. The two models of coordination market demand forecasting models and methods are analyzed separately. Finally, after analyzing the prediction results of the two different prediction methods, it is found that it conforms to the actual situation of coordination development in Jiangxi Province. It shows that the coordination market prediction model established in this paper is meaningful and the prediction analysis made has some practical value.	future
1014	协同技术	FLED-Block: Federated Learning Ensembled Deep Learning Blockchain Model for COVID-19 Prediction	With the SARS-CoV-2's exponential growth, intelligent and constructive practice is required to diagnose the COVID-19. The rapid spread of the virus and the shortage of reliable testing models are considered major issues in detecting COVID-19. This problem remains the peak burden for clinicians. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in image processing, the burden of diagnosing the COVID-19 cases has been reduced to acceptable thresholds. But traditional AI techniques often require centralized data storage and training for the predictive model development which increases the computational complexity. The real-world challenge is to exchange data globally across hospitals while also taking into account of the organizations' privacy concerns. Collaborative model development and privacy protection are critical considerations while training a global deep learning model. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on blockchain and the federated learning model. The federated learning model takes care of reduced complexity, and blockchain helps in distributed data with privacy maintained. More precisely, the proposed federated learning ensembled deep five learning blockchain model (FLED-Block) framework collects the data from the different medical healthcare centers, develops the model with the hybrid capsule learning network, and performs the prediction accurately, while preserving the privacy and shares among authorized persons. Extensive experimentation has been carried out using the lung CT images and compared the performance of the proposed model with the existing VGG-16 and 19, Alexnets, Resnets-50 and 100, Inception V3, Densenets-121, 119, and 150, Mobilenets, SegCaps in terms of accuracy (98.2%), precision (97.3%), recall (96.5%), specificity (33.5%), and F1-score (97%) in predicting the COVID-19 with effectively preserving the privacy of the data among the heterogeneous users.	image processing;artificial intelligence;extreme learning machine;privacy preservation;capsule learning modelframework;machine;spread

1016	实体经济	Blockchain application in circular marine plastic debris management	The threat to the environment and humanity caused by marine plastic debris has aroused global attention. This research aims to explore the feasibility of applying blockchain technology (BCT) in marine plastic debris management. A case study on three pioneer recycling organizations is conducted based on secondary data. The study found that BCT can be applied to solve some of the existing challenges of marine plastic debris management. A digital token system and identity recognition mechanism based on BCT can increase the public awareness for marine plastic debris governance. The derived digital wallets and distributed ledgers can effectively replace paper documents and cash transactions in the traditional recycling chain, and minimize global impact on local economies, thus improve efficiency and safety. Also, the traceability and high transparency of blockchain and the application of smart contracts can effectively build a global recycling network. In addition, the application of BCT can greatly improve the transparency of recycling value chains, and make them more accepting of supervision from society and consumers. This research is one of the first studies on BCT in marine plastic debris management and explores worldwide pioneering companies. In practice, this study can help companies analyse the defects in their own waste disposal models and help practitioners make decisions to adopt BCT. In academia, as one of the early exploratory studies on the application of BCT to the treatment of marine plastic debris, this study provides further empirical reference on BCT based business models and recycling chains, and can guide future research in this field.	blockchain technology;recycling value chains;marine plastic;debris management;circular economy;sustainable supply chainscoastal area;supply chain;abundance;economy;opportunities;environment;technology;operations;industry;litter

This study aims to develop a framework that describes the main phases of Blockchain-enabled CSCM and evaluates the critical success factors of Blockchain implementation for CSCM. Further, we employed a combined analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to explore the priorities and relationships of success factors using evaluations from academic and professional experts. The outcome of the AHP analysis shows that the success factors related to technology, such as technical capability, technological maturity, and technological feasibility, play critical roles in CSCM. Furthermore, the DEMATEL analysis suggests that knowledge training and data security should be regarded as essential causal factors influencing other factors. The results provide a possible path for determining critical success factors and facilitating Blockchain-enabled CSCM.	blockchain implementation;circular supply chain management;critical success factors;ahp-dematel methodologybusiness models;technology;barriers;economy;integration;operations;framework;programs;adoption;agility

1020	核心技术	Blockchain based hierarchical semi-decentralized approach using IPFS for secure and efficient data sharing	Nowadays, cloud servers are gathering an increasing amount of data. Data is commonly stored on cloud servers in the form of ciphertext to protect security and concealment of data. When a consumer requests to access of encrypted data, a third party must provide an access key. The system's security, however, will be compromised if the third party or internal personnel are dishonest. To address this issue, a novel blockchain-based secure decentralized system using IPFS is proposed in this research for secure data transfer. Because all participant of system model are recorded the every action on the chain, and the continuously extending chain makes it conditionally difficult to modify any block without being detected, a blockchain based system is often regarded as a safe platform. In the proposed approach, the data owner uploads an encrypted file to IPFS, which is subsequently separated into n secret sections called hash codes for data security. The data owner must additionally write the access permissions in order to achieve access to this secure data. For security, the system uses two-level key management: first, the data owner encrypts the file, and then the IPFS server makes a hash code of that encrypted file. The proposed solution, which employs blockchain technology, enables consumers to be handled across several domains, erase the single-point failure in traditional centralized systems, and overhead related to communication and computation are decreased at the consumer level. According to the security analysis, the proposed system might effectively resist single and collaboratively malicious persons, as well as untrustworthy cloud servers. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

1021	实体经济	Blockchain Technology, Inter-Organizational Relationships, and Management Accounting: A Synthesis and a Research Agenda	Blockchain technology is increasingly emerging as an important organizational phenomenon, especially for collaboration across firm boundaries. Over the past three decades, accounting scholars have shown significant interest in management accounting and control mechanisms that are used by actors to sustain inter-organizational relationships. We outline fundamental technical features and limitations of permissioned blockchain technology and analytically propose blockchain as an empirical concept with implications for management accounting practices that underpin inter-organizational collaboration, trust, control, and information exchange. Particular focus of the analysis is on the interplay between the technical capabilities of blockchain technology and inter-organizational management control procedures. Based on this analysis, we develop a series of propositions that theorize how these procedures affect the way in which blockchain is enacted in IORs, and how they are affected by blockchain in turn. The paper concludes with a research agenda for accounting scholars and offers directions for further research.	blockchain;management accounting;inter-organizational relationships;management control;information systems;collaborationinterfirm relationships;information-technology;appropriation concerns;partner selection;calculative trust;supply chain;cooperation;contracts;governance;coordination
1022	虚拟经济	Combination of Blockchain and AI for Music Intellectual Property Protection	In the last two years, due to the pandemic and restrictive measures, the dependence of music creators and artists on the Internet, where they could promote their work, organize live streaming concerts, and talk to the public, has increased and expanded even more and seeks higher revenue from digital music platforms. An important issue that arises from the above statement is protecting the authors' copyright regarding the uses and sharing in the digital services of their works with protected content. Although circulated in digital information, the protected content is not information but a product of ethical and commercial value. While it has an intangible owner and it owes its existence to the creative idea of its creator, it is not an idea. The imposition of legal and commercial conditions on its movement cannot be associated with any restrictions on the free movement of information, as it is not related to them. In general, the unauthorized exchange of digital music files via peer-to-peer violates copyright law. The exchange of files is unauthorized, as it does not have the relevant permission from the creators and beneficiaries and is therefore illegal. With this in mind, this paper proposes a highly effective way of protecting the copyright of music technology, which is based on the widespread use of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and cryptography technologies. Specifically, an advanced blockchain model based on Hyperledger Fabric is introduced, which, however, uses Quantum Homomorphic Encryption and Quantum Zero-Knowledge Arguments. Music files are implemented as Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs), which activate smart contracts. Finally, an advanced collaborative filtering algorithm provides recommendations for effectiveness in securing the copyrights of music industry creators. A specialized scenario was built to model the proposed system to verify the degree of protection on music intellectual property in developing a security simulation with an innovative consensus-based zero knowledge and the quantum fully homomorphic encryption technique. Experiment results show that this technique can aid in implementing a technologically aware system capable of providing a powerful answer to a current real-world problem.	
1023	实体经济	Government by Code? Blockchain Applications to Public Sector Governance	Studies of blockchain governance can be divided into analyses of the governance of blockchains (such as rules and power dynamics within a given network) and governance by blockchains (such as how blockchains can be implemented to improve self-governance of community-based peer production networks). Less emphasis has been placed on applications of distributed ledgers to public sector governance. Our review clarifies that the decentralization and distributive features that enable blockchains to link up loosely connected private organizations and public agencies to improve efficiency and transparency of government transactions. However, most blockchain applications lack clear advantages over the conventional digital recording of information. In addition, our review highlights that blockchain applications in public sector governance are potentially vast, though in most instances, the existing applications have not extended much beyond limited-scale pilots. We conclude with a call for the construction of indexes of public sector implementations of blockchains, as none yet exist, as well as for additional research to understand why governments have not deployed blockchains more widely.	polycentricity;public sector governance;legal institutions;public procurement;blockchains

1025	技术治理	Do we need to pay technical debt in blockchain software systems?	For blockchain software systems, framework developers may introduce technical debts that application developers are not aware of. Because these technical debts can have a negative impact on software projects, we need to investigate the issue of technical debt in blockchain software systems. We wanted to investigate what types of self-introduced technical debt exist in open-source blockchain software systems, and how these technical debts are distributed. We have selected six most popular blockchain software projects from GitHub. Then the code comments from these software projects were extracted and manually labelled. Finally, the code comments were statistically analysed. We propose a new type of technical debt, resource debt, which is explicitly identified by the framework developers and requires special attention in subsequent production systems. Six types of technical debt are prevalent and there is not any algorithm debt. In addition, we find that the code comments containing technical debt are not entirely determined by task tags. SATD is prevalent in blockchain projects. There is more significant variability between different application software projects for different technical debts. The results of the study imply that for detecting SATD, deep semantic discovery models should be used, such as pre-trained models.	self-admitted technical debt;blockchain;empirical study;software engineering
1026	实体经济	Identification and analysis of adoption barriers of disruptive technologies in the logistics industry	Purpose Recently, disruptive technologies (DTs) have proposed several innovative applications in managing logistics and promise to transform the entire logistics sector drastically. Often, this transformation is not successful due to the existence of adoption barriers to DTs. This study aims to identify the significant barriers that impede the successful adoption of DTs in the logistics sector and examine the interrelationships amongst them. Design/methodology/approach Initially, 12 critical barriers were identified through an extensive literature review on disruptive logistics management, and the barriers were screened to ten relevant barriers with the help of Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM). Further, an Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach was built with the inputs from logistics experts working in the various departments of warehouses, inventory control, transportation, freight management and customer service management. ISM approach was then used to generate and examine the interrelationships amongst the critical barriers. Matrics d'Impacts Croises-Multiplication Applique a Classement (MICMAC) analysed the barriers based on the barriers' driving and dependence power. Findings Results from the ISM-based technique reveal that the lack of top management support (B6) was a critical barrier that can influence the adoption of DTs. Other significant barriers, such as legal and regulatory frameworks (B1), infrastructure (B3) and resistance to change (B2), were identified as the driving barriers, and industries need to pay more attention to them for the successful adoption of DTs in logistics. The MICMAC analysis shows that the legal and regulatory framework and lack of top management support have the highest driving powers. In contrast, lack of trust, reliability and privacy/security emerge as barriers with high dependence powers. Research limitations/implications The authors' study has several implications in the light of DT substitution. First, this study successfully analyses the seven DTs using Adner and Kapoor's framework (2016a, b) and the Theory of Disruptive Innovation (Christensen, 1997; Christensen et al., 2011) based on the two parameters as follows: emergence challenge of new technology and extension opportunity of old technology. Second, this study categorises these seven DTs into four quadrants from the framework. Third, this study proposes the recommended paths that DTs might want to follow to be adopted quickly. Practical implications The authors' study has several managerial implications in light of the adoption of DTs. First, the authors' study identified no autonomous barriers to adopting DTs. Second, other barriers belonging to any lower level of the ISM model can influence the dependent barriers. Third, the linkage barriers are unstable, and any preventive action involving linkage barriers would subsequently affect linkage barriers and other barriers. Fourth, the independent barriers have high influencing powers over other barriers. Originality/value The contributions of this study are four-fold. First, the study identifies the different DTs in the logistics sector. Second, the study applies the theory of disruptive innovations and the ecosystems framework to rationalise the choice of these seven DTs. Third, the study identifies and critically assesses the barriers to the successful adoption of these DTs through a strategic evaluation procedure with the help of a framework built with inputs from logistics experts. Fourth, the study recognises DTs adoption barriers in logistics management and provides a foundation for future research to eliminate those barriers.	disruptive technologies;internet of things;blockchain;bigdata;drone;driverless vehicle;artificial intelligence;3d printing;logistics managementsupply chain management;big data analytics;things iot adoption;artificial-intelligence;manufacturing technology;autonomous vehicles;blockchain research;reverse logistics;driverless cars;ism approach
1027	协同技术	Towards a Trustful Game-Theoretic Mechanism for Data Trading in the Blockchain-IoT Ecosystem	This paper introduces a data trading system based on the blockchain network, where a trusted data aggregator collects data from the Internet of Things (IoT) device owners and sells them in the format of different packages to multiple buyers. In this paper, we formulate infinitely repeated games between rational buyers that are competing with each other to obtain the required data records. Buyers update their bidding strategies to maximize their profits based on the outcome of previous games. We validate the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in a one-shot game, finite, and infinitely repeated games. To ensure data owners' privacy, a novel trust mechanism design is used to impede untruthful buyers to win the game. To prevent the use of a third party such as an auctioneer, all of these methods are implemented as smart contracts on the Hyperledger blockchain. We provide extensive analysis to demonstrate that the proposed system satisfies the properties of completeness, soundness, computationally efficiency, truthfulness, budget balance, and individual rationality. Lastly, we provide simulation experiments to demonstrate the performance of our blockchain network using different metrics, such as transaction throughput, latency, and resource consumption under different parameters.	blockchain network;internet of things;trust;data trading;data privacy;game theorysecure;framework;privacy;model

Blockchain has greater significant feature as it makes the secure data access without enabling the central management entity. Two design features of blockchain technology help in this task. Recommended customer data pattern recognition technique using blockchain may eliminate all these problems. Two kinds of cryptographic algorithms employed in blockchain are asymmetric-key algorithms and hash functions. The current study analyzes the asymmetric cryptography approach along with key pair which supports in system security. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifier techniques consider both old customers and new customers as stable. The predictive model aids in identifying customers at churn risk in the telecommunication system. Existing proactive methods are unable to explain difficulties in customer interaction understanding and meeting their genuine needs. The proposed model organizes the customer situation and designs a customer proactive re-engagement over mobile-based telecommunication systems. Performance measures like churn prediction, classifier, confusion matrix, machine learning in the telecommunication system are used to evaluate and validate the results.	churn prediction;blockchain technology;classifier;support vector machine;climatic weather;telecommunication systemmodel

This paper aims to test the dynamic relationship of cryptocurrencies with supply chain and logistics stocks. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the author tests the causal and long-run relationship between logistics and supply chain stocks with the corresponding cryptocurrencies related to these fields, or those that are known to exhibit characteristics that can be utilized by these fields, testing also whether the COVID-19 pandemic affected this relationship. To do so, the author performs the variable-lag causality to test the causal relationship, and examines if this relationship changed due to COVID-19. The author then implements the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis to investigate the characteristics of a possible long-run relationship, testing also whether they changed due to COVID-19. Findings The results indicate that there is a positive long-run relationship between each logistics and supply chain stocks and the corresponding cryptocurrencies, before and also during COVID-19, but during COVID-19 this relationship becomes weaker, in most cases. Moreover, before COVID-19, the majority of the cases indicate a causal direction from cryptocurrencies to the stocks, while during COVID-19, the causal relationships decrease in multitude, and most cases unveil a causal direction from the stocks to cryptocurrencies. Originality/value The causal pattern changed during COVID-19, and the long-run relationship became weaker, showing a change in the dynamics in the relationship between logistics and supply chain stocks with cryptocurrencies.	covid-19;logistics;supply chains;cryptocurrencies;causality;long-run relationship;c50;c58blockchain;economy;urban
1031	市场治理	Price competition and blockchain adoption in retailing markets	The blockchain is essentially a shared database, and the data stored is unforgeable, open and transparent, which may allow the retailers adopting the blockchain technology to attract more consumers by making product information more transparent, while it also leads to the risk of consumers privacy leakage due to storing the corresponding consumers' personal information. In order to study the impact of blockchain technology on competitive retailers' strategic pricing, we establish a retailer competition model including an initial retailer and an entrant retailer both of whom can decide whether to apply the blockchain technology. We obtain the optimal prices and corresponding profits of the two retailers when applying and not applying blockchain, respectively, and find that consumer privacy concerns decline both retailers' prices and profits when adopting blockchain technology because consumer privacy concerns lower consumers' valuations of products, thereby reducing demand. Furthermore, we analyze the two retailers' equilibrium strategies of the application of blockchain technology, which suggests that it is not always beneficial for retailers to adopt blockchain technology in all situations. Both retailers will apply blockchain only when consumer privacy concerns are lower and information transparency promotion is higher because higher information transparency promotion increases consumers' willingness to pay, which exceeds the cost of consumers privacy concerns. On the contrary, when consumer privacy concerns are higher and information transparency promotion is lower, neither retailer will apply blockchain technology. Interestingly, when both consumer privacy concerns and information transparency promotion are medium, the initial retailer will apply blockchain technology and the entrant retailer will not because consumers' higher trust in initial retailer allows the initial retailer can bear higher cost of consumers privacy concerns which is hard to undertake for the new entrant retailer when information transparency promotion is medium.

1032	市场治理	Is liquidity risk priced in cryptocurrency markets?	This paper investigates the pricing of liquidity risk in the cross-section of cryptocurrencies from January 2017 to December 2020. The cryptocurrencies with high liquidity risk (beta) earned a risk-adjusted return of 4.4% higher weekly than those with low liquidity risk after controlling for the market, size, and reversal factors. Furthermore, the positive relation between expected cryptocurrency returns and liquidity risk is robust when I use cross-sectional regression tests for individual cryptocurrencies and alternative liquidity measures. The results suggest that liquidity risk is an important determinant of expected cryptocurrency returns.	liquidity risk;cryptocurrency;asset pricing;cross-sectional returnsbid-ask spreads

1034	实体经济	Inter-Domain Prefix and Route Validation Using Fast and Scalable DAG Based Distributed Ledger for Secure BGP Routing	Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the default inter-domain routing protocol on the Internet, lacks inherent mechanisms to validate the prefix ownership and integrity of inter-domain routes exchanged among multiple domains, resulting in BGP hijack attacks. Conventional security approaches such as RPKI and BGPSec are centralized and complex by nature, and require changes to existing routing infrastructure. In recent times, blockchain based solutions are proposed for validating the routing information exchanged across different domains in a decentralized manner. However, because of lower transaction throughput, longer confirmation time and huge storage overhead, the existing solutions are not suitable for validating the routing information exchanged among domains, where a large number of prefix allocations and BGP route advertisements are recorded as transactions on the blockchain. This work proposes an Inter-domain Prefix and Route Validation (IPRV) framework for validating prefix ownership and inter-domain routes exchanged among the domains on the Internet. IPRV leverages (a) Fast and Scalable Directed Acyclic Graph-based Distributed Ledger (FSD2L) to record transactions corresponding to the prefix allocations and BGP route advertisements made by different domains on the Internet, and (b) Route Validation Nodes (RVNs) which maintain FSD2L to provide prefix and route validation services to the BGP routers within a domain. IPRV framework is implemented and verified using docker containers, and the simulations performed on large inter-domain networks showed that the proposed IPRV framework using RVNs and FSD2L achieves high transaction throughput while minimizing the storage consumption of the FSD2L.	bgp;inter-domain routing;blockchain;distributed ledger;directed acyclic graph
1035	实体经济	Including the reefer chain into genuine beef cold chain architecture based on blockchain technology	Improving the cold chain system for perishable foods would both increase food safety by maintaining quality and reduce business operation costs by minimizing food loss from inappropriate management. This has led to various attempts to apply blockchain technology (BCT) to the food cold chain, such as IBM's FoodTrust and Alibaba's Food Trust Frameworks. This system is expected to guarantee food traceability and sustainability. In this research, we focused on the importance of maritime and aviation transportation in the entire supply chain, and we established the BCT-based beef cold chain system, which includes the reefer chain. Specifically, we raised the monitoring and physical infrastructure issues at the port (or airport) and maritime (aviation) transportation node and took these into consideration. Additionally, we conducted scenario analysis to investigate the effects of the suggested system. The amount of food losses and the associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are calculated by different scenarios in accordance with the recall recovery time and node where a recall occurrence is recognized. For both import and export models, when the proposed BCT-based beef cold chain platform is applied, the number of discarded reefer containers and the associated GHG emissions go down by 42.1% and 21.8%, respectively. Interestingly, when we assumed the recall recognition stage was right after the defects occur, the largest effects of improving performance of the proposed platform were 48.3% in import (IM) node of the port level. These results will provide a needed solution for cold chain management at the government level and affirms the essential role of the port/airport in the cold chain.	reefer chain;cold chain;blockchain;beef;ghg emission;flwfood loss;waste
1036	实体经济	The Potential of Blockchain Technology in the Transition towards Sustainable Food Systems	Food systems are both contributing to and affected by environmental degradation and climate change. The transition towards resilient and sustainable food systems is essential to ensure food security and minimise negative environmental impacts. Innovative technologies can accelerate this transition. Blockchain technology (BCT) is attracting attention as it can deliver transparency to complex global food supply chains and has the potential to guide current food production towards better sustainability and efficiency. This case study investigated the opportunities that BCT can offer to food supply chains. Qualitative interviews with eight main BCT providers were conducted to evaluate the current state of BCT and put it into perspective by mapping out advantages, disadvantages, incentives, motives, and expectations connected to its implementation in global food systems. A thematic analysis showed that, while BCT was considered beneficial by all interviewees, uptake is slow due to high implementation costs and the lack of incentives for companies throughout the food chain from farms to food industry and retail. Results further revealed that the advantages of BCT go beyond communication of trustworthy information and development of closer producer-consumer relationships. In fact, it can provide the opportunity to decrease food waste, enhance working conditions throughout the supply chain, and promote sustainable consumption habits. As BCT may be increasingly used in the food supply chain, the results give a basis for future research that may leverage both qualitative and quantitative methods to examine actors' behaviours. Also, the importance of improving user experiences through functional applications and software to facilitate the adoption of the technology is stressed.	blockchain;sustainability;food systems;food supply chains;transparency;agri-food;traceabilitysupply chain;agriculture

1038	实体经济	The Impact of Health Risk Perception on Blockchain Traceable Fresh Fruits Purchase Intention in China	This paper systematically investigates the impact of consumers' health risk perceptions on the purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits in China. It uses online-survey data collected from four pilot cities that are part of the food traceability system in China. The ordinary least squares (OLS) and the ordered probit model was applied to examine the posited relationships. The results show that consumers' health risk perception has a significant positive effect on the purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits. The stronger consumers' health risk perception, the stronger their purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits. Likewise, heterogeneity exists among gender, age, income, and education in their corresponding effect of consumers' health risk perception on blockchain traceable fresh fruit purchase intention. This suggests that male, high-aged, high-income and high-educated groups have a higher health risk perception, and therefore a higher purchase perception for blockchain traceable fresh fruits than female, low-aged, low-income and low-educated, respectively. Furthermore, family structure, consumers' traceability cognition and purchase experience of traceable products affect the purchase intention of blockchain traceable fresh fruits. The study has several insights on the broader promotion, acceptance and development of the food traceability system and provides practical cues for policy and practice.	health risk perception;blockchain;traceable;fresh fruit;incomegender-differences;behavior;consumption;system
1039	实体经济	Subsidy and pricing strategies of an agri-food supply chain considering the application of Big Data and blockchain	Based on the advantages of Big Data and blockchain in food traceability area and information sharing area, it has attracted widespread attentions. However, it is not so popular in agricultural field, a vital reason is the scarcity of effective incentives. Government incentive as an important incentive measure is thought to be useful. To study the subsidy rules in the new background, we chose an agri-food supply chain with one producer and one retailer as research object and divided government incentive into direct incentive and indirect incentive. Then, considering the changes of consumer perceived safety on agri-food in the new environment, the demand function was revised. Furthermore, we proposed and analyzed three subsidy models and their benefit functions considering the information service inputs based on Big Data and blockchain (BBIS). Findings: (1) The subsidy models will not change the variation tendency of prices and benefits with the BBIS optimization coefficient, the BBIS investment costs from the producer and the retailer, the ascension of the unreliability coefficient of quality safety and the agri-food quality level. (2) When the subsidy coefficients about direct and indirect subsidies can meet a relationship, benefits of chain members in the indirect subsidy model are higher than them in the direct subsidy model. Findings offer a theoretical guidance for government departments to make and implement the subsidy strategies. In addition, for company, it can provide a theoretical guidance on setting pricing strategies in the new technology background.	government incentive;big data;blockchain;agri-food supply chaininvestment decision-making;china;coordination;policy

1042	实体经济	P2P energy trading: Blockchain-enabled P2P energy society with multi-scale flexibility services	A deeper decarbonization perspective is undergoing with the increasing engagement of new distributed players and the deployment of innovative behind-the-meter flexibility services. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading has emerged as an innovative mechanism to foster the direct energy sharing among multi-level market players with pre-determined responsibility and privacy. However, compared with other P2P assets trading, P2P energy trading is facing huge challenges in achieving a large-scale commercialization due to the cooperation obstacles between non-professional distributed players and regulated players as Distributed System Operator (DSO), Transmission System Operator (TSO) and utilities. It is related to not only business and marketing, but also energy system operation to keep secure and reliable with injection of new roles, new utilization patterns, and new markets. This paper investigates the socio-technical interaction and mechanism for the sustainable P2P energy trading from the social dimension on the cooperation of multi-level market players, the technical dimension on the cutting-edge exchange of flexibility, and the economical dimension on the inter-operative decentralized/regulated marketplaces. Three questions are targeted on: (1) How Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enables co-creation of decentralized heterogeneous user-centered digital frameworks for the large-scale P2P trading interaction, (2) What specific energy services drive the cross-border interactions for exchange of multi-scale P2P flexibility, (3) How operational framework in P2P energy trading achieves the inter-operative marketplaces with the formation of trusted P2P energy society and the injection of multi-scale flexibility services. Finally, regulation challenges on P2P energy trading implementation are discussed for the guide of future work. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

1043	实体经济	The design of power grid data management system based on blockchain technology and construction of system security evaluation model	The construction of smart grid has triggered comprehensive changes in power equipment. At the same time, massive data are waiting to be screened, analyzed and processed. However, there are many data sources and complex data structure in smart grid, and smart grid requires higher security, reliability, traceability, non-repudiation and real-time performance of data processing, which poses unprecedented challenges to the traditional data management. Blockchain technology has the advantages of decentralization, autonomy, leakage prevention and openness. It can match the demands of power data management in terms of operation mode, security protection, complement power data, and better meet the security and credibility requirements of energy Internet. Therefore, this paper designs the smart grid data management system based on blockchain, and constructs the system security evaluation model by using AHP and expert consultation method. Firstly, the characteristics of smart grid big data and blockchain technology are analyzed; Then the technical architecture of data management system is designed by using alliance chain, and the technical architecture is analyzed in detail; Finally, the index factors affecting system security are combed, and the system security evaluation model is constructed by AHP. Distributed storage, asymmetric encryption, consensus mechanism, and other technologies of blockchain technology can well solve the problems of power grid data storage and application, and better ensure the security of smart grid data.

1044	实体经济	Blockchain-based balance settlement ledger for energy communities in open electricity markets	Sharing local co-owned photovoltaic (PV) energy in multifamily residential buildings is inefficient. Energy produced and consumed within the same building may be considered purchased energy, of which the customer must pay the purchase price, the network service fee, and taxes. As PV typically does not allow self-sufficiency in the Nordic countries, a distribution system operator is needed to provide the grid connection. Earlier solutions to this problem are focused on energy communities where an energy aggregator is responsible for the energy balance settlement. However, this does not allow the energy community members to remain in the open electricity market. This paper introduces a blockchain-based balance settlement ledger and a set of rules for energy sharing in energy communities where members participate in the open electricity market while supplied with local low-cost PV energy. This, to the authors' knowledge, has not been previously implemented. The blockchain mitigates the need for any central entity for balance settlement and ensures fair sharing of PV energy. The existing smart meters can be used so no investments are required. The system performance is tested with simulations which show potential for increase in profitability. The self-sufficiency rate increases in our test scenario from 4.03% to 9.61%. (C) 2022 The Authors.

1045	实体经济	Editable and Verifiable Anonymous Authentication Incorporating Blockchain in the Internet of Energy	With the continuous development of the Internet of Energy, the access of a large number of distributed renewable energy has caused difficulties in energy management. The traditional energy management mode cannot meet the needs of existing energy management and trading. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated energy management platform based on blockchain, which allows multiple decentralized energy management systems to conduct unified identity authentication. At the same time, an editable and verifiable anonymous authentication (EVAA) scheme integrating blockchain in the Internet of Energy is designed, which combines the idea of chameleon hash (CH) and the algorithm of elliptic curve encryption (ECC) to realize the dual identity authentication of user information. Finally, the generated certificate is stored in the chain through blockchain consensus. The scheme is mainly constructed using multiple secure cryptographic algorithms, which combine the advantages of blockchain for information authentication. Thus, it can accomplish user cross-system authentication and transaction, and achieve more secure editable anonymous identity authentication through the algorithm performance test, compared with the existing similar schemes under the unified test standard. This paper not only ensures the operation efficiency, but also reflects the obvious advantage of realizing higher intensity security performance.	internet of energy;blockchain;anonymous authentication;editable;verification

It allows a user to create a mutable transaction associated with an access policy, whereas a modifier who possesses sufficient rewriting privileges from a trusted authority satisfying the access policy can rewrite the mutable transaction. However, it lacks a revocation mechanism. The modifiers can always rewrite the mutable transactions even if their given rewriting privileges are compromised. In this work, we introduce revocable policy-based chameleon. The property of revocation allows some modifiers' rewriting privileges to be revoked, regardless of whether their rewriting privileges are compromised or not.	blockchain rewriting;policy-based chameleon hash;revocationattribute-based encryption

1049	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Automatic Tracking and Extracting Construction Document for Claim and Dispute Support	During a long-term construction project, numerous stakeholders participate and collaborate with each other. In such scenario, the processes of creating, storing, and managing project documents are highly complicated. Due to the nature of the construction projects, problems arise in document management such as loss of documents and difficulties in tracking, which can result in claim failure and huge damage. This study proposes a method to efficiently record, search, and manage construction documents that can protect legal rights in preparation for claims/disputes. This study designed a system that can generate, transfer, and synchronize blocks based on email communication whenever an event occurs. It also provides functions such as document search, history tracking, automatic extraction of related document, and authenticity verification for document management. The findings of the study have established that reliability of documents is secured during the recording, storing, and managing processes, and thus claim- and dispute-supporting tasks are supported.	construction management;claim & dispute support;permissioned blockchain;computer application;document tracking;authenticity verificationtechnology
1050	核心技术	A fair consensus model in blockchain based on computational reputation	Fair selection of community members' transactions in blockchain-based technologies, especially in finance, is essential and vital. Therefore, in this paper, a novel consensus model for fair selection of community members' transactions through reputation models is presented as fair reputation-based consensus model (FRCM), so that all transactions of community members have the same weight and transactions are selected regardless of the transaction fee or the assets or computing power but based on the reputation of the trustees who are responsible for placing the transactions in the block. For this purpose, a FRCM prototype has been designed and implemented based on the proposed algorithms. Experimental and theoretical evaluations and simulation results show that the FRCM can select the transactions of community members fairly while reducing the average response time effectively. In addition, comparative analysis with other consensus mechanisms proved that FRCM model has lower consensus latency than other mechanisms, while improving throughput and scalability.	blockchain;consensus;reputation model;fair selectiontrust model

Nevertheless, industries and their supply chain need to consider several requirements for blockchain implementation to realize a circular economy. To achieve this goal, requirements for implementing blockchain technology in construction supply chain were prioritized based on circular economy attributes. For multiple-criteria decision analysis and making our preference decision, we employed the new-founded multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method, the "Fuzzy Ordinal Priority Approach (Fuzzy OPA)." Under uncertainty conditions, this method can determine fuzzy weights of circular economy attributes and fuzzy scores of blockchain requirements using linguistic variables. The results obtained from the case study show that three high-ranked requirements for implementing blockchain are (1) developing circular economy attributes on platforms, (2) intra-organizational considerations, and (3) technological requirements and collaboration infrastructure. To discuss the circular economy, we used the ReSOLVE framework, consisting of six attributes "Regenerate, Share, Optimize, Loop, Virtualize, and Exchange." According to research findings, blockchain implementation can move the construction industry toward a circular economy through (1) regenerating environment, (2) optimizing systems performance, and (3) looping and circulating products.	distributed ledger technology;blockchain implementation;circular economy attributes;fuzzy ordinal priority approach;multiple-criteria decision analysis;construction supply chain;resolve frameworkindustry;adoption

1055	实体经济	Building the Future of Digital Advertising One Block at a Time: How Blockchain Technology Can Change Advertising Practice and Research	In this article we provide a primer for blockchain technology (BT) and explain ways that it has been applied (or can be applied) to the field of advertising research and practice. We situate this primer inside a critical look at the evolution of digital advertising that has been driven largely by immediate technological need for the maximization of profit rather than considerations for societal well-being. We discuss arenas in which the current state of digital advertising is not well positioned to maximize societal well-being and has built a consumer distrust of digital advertising, specifically with regard to the areas of privacy invasion, value to consumers, technology companies' power, inaccuracies of personalizations, and misinformation spread. Throughout this article we discuss how blockchain technologies can be used as a research environment for testing new paths for digital advertising that could tackle these issues and be more beneficial to society. We also provide an overview of avenues for future research on BT application in the digital advertising ecosystem.	web-based personalization;privacy concerns;online;knowledge
1056	协同技术	A Novel Secured Multi-Access Edge Computing based VANET with Neuro fuzzy systems based Blockchain Framework	In vehicle ad-hoc networks, the progression of wireless communication technology to 6G, overcomes storage, processing, privacy, and power limits to create an efficient and intelligent next generation transportation system. Vehicular ad hoc network may now offer remarkable availability, reliability, and throughput using 6G technology. However, the VANET system's data should be protected. This paper proposes an effective batch authentication and key exchange technique to avoid contact with hostile vehicle users. Moreover, three types of systems are proposed: PKI, ID-based, and MAC-based. The neuro-fuzzy inference technique was used to predict VANET security ratings. The Homogeneous Discrete-Time Markov Chain model is used to secure data transit. Additionally, this research examined the work from a blockchain perspective combined with MEC. There are 3 level to comprise the architecture: perception, edge computing, and services. Throughout the blockchain transmission process, the first layer make certain the security of VANET data. The perception layer makes use of edge computing and cloud services on the edge. The service layer protects data by using both traditional cloud storage and blockchain technology. The lowest layer of the system architecture is dedicated to the throughput and quality of service requirements of MEC users. The primary challenge is achieving consensus across blockchain nodes while maintaining the MEC system's and blockchain's performance. To simulate the joint optimization problem, a Markov decision process with reward function is utilized. The simulation results are conferred to illustrate the validity of study assertions.	blockchain;vanet;authentication;6gvehicular networks;intelligent;consensus;challenges
1057	核心技术	An arbitrable multi-replica data auditing scheme based on smart contracts	In order to improve the availability and persistence of data, lightweight cloud users want to store multiple-replicas of the original file on the server with less local computing and storage overhead. Meanwhile, to ensure the integrity of the remote storage data, some schemes have been designed to allow public verification. However, most existing schemes only focus on malicious cloud service providers and ignore the possibility that dishonest users cheat for profit. This article implements an arbitrable data auditing scheme under multi-replica storage. The scheme adopts a new arbitration mechanism under multi-replica storage, makes use of the non-tampering characteristics of smart contracts, carries out reliable verification through miners, and realizes the timely detection and punishment of any fraudulent entity. In addition, the scheme also designs a multi-replica storage model based on the B* tree, realizes the batch verification of replica blocks, enables the fraud behavior of malicious users to be identified after data update, and improves the space utilization efficiency. The article also gives detailed security proof of the proposed scheme. The evaluation result shows our scheme not only realizes a more practical and fairer audit scheme but also has lower computational overhead than current state-of-the-art multi-replica arbitrable schemes.	data dynamics;data integrity;multi-replica data auditing;provable data possession;provable security;smart contractprovable data possession;cloud;storage
1058	实体经济	Security-Aware and Privacy-Preserving Personal Health Record Sharing Using Consortium Blockchain	With the fast boom of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and an increasing focus on personal health, personal health data are extensively collected by IoMT and stored as personal health records (PHRs). PHRs are frequently shared for accurate diagnosis, prognosis prediction, health advice consulting, etc. Since PHRs are highly private, the data-sharing process leads to wide-ranging concerns on privacy leakage and security compromise. Existing research has shown that the centralized systems, as the mainstream mode, are under the great risks. Motivated by this, we propose a consortium blockchain-based PHR management and sharing scheme, which is both security aware and privacy preserving. We adopt the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store the PHR ciphertext of IoMT. Then, zero-knowledge proof can provide evidence for verifying keyword index authentication on blockchain. Moreover, the scheme jointly leverages modified attribute-based cryptographic primitives and tailor-made smart contracts to achieve secure search, privacy preservation, and personalized access control in IoMT scenarios. Security analysis is conducted to show that the designed protocols attain the expected design goals. This is followed by extensive evaluation results derived from real-world data sets, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over current leading ones.	blockchains;cryptography;encryption;smart contracts;security;data privacy;access control;access control;consortium blockchain;data security;internet of things (iot);personal health records;privacy preservation;smart contractresearch issues;cloud;encryption;framework;search
1059	实体经济	Keyword search over encrypted cloud data based on blockchain in smart medical applications	In consideration of the inconvenience of sharing user identity authorization, and the lack of correctness verification for searching electronic medical records in hospitals under the many-to-many search model, we propose an blockchain-aided searchable attribute-based encryption scheme that supports verification, we apply the scheme to electronic health record systems. Using blockchain technology, the ciphertext document is stored in the medical cloud, the secure index is stored in the blockchain, and the smart contract is used for searching, which reduces the computational burden of the medical cloud. In addition, this scheme can verify whether the results returned by the cloud server are correct, ensure data integrity and confidentiality. The scheme eliminates duplicate data and reduces the storage space of the medical cloud. Furthermore, users' privacy security is guaranteed due to the hiding of access policy. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme satisfies the semantic security of adaptively chosen-keyword attacks, can effectively protect the confidentiality of medical data and anonymity of users. Performance analysis and experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves optimizations in security index generation, trapdoor generation, search efficiency and result verification; hence, it is more suitable for many-to-many search scenarios such as smart medical applications. It effectively realizes the sharing of patient electronic medical records between doctors and third-party users without infringing on patient privacy.	attribute-based encryption;blockchain;data deduplication;policy hiding;smart medicalpersonal health records;secure deduplication;efficient;privacy;scheme;authority
1060	实体经济	Secure Decentralized Attribute-Based Sharing of Personal Health Records With Blockchain	Personal health records (PHRs) are located in a patient-centered electronic health system in which users can store and share medical information. However, PHRs have recently been plagued by security issues, such as the leakage of personal health information, illegal access to patient data, and data tampering. Recent security developments, such as introducing an access control policy with attribute-based encryption (ABE) or utilizing blockchain, have only been partially successful in solving these issues. Ongoing challenges to PHR sharing include single points of failure, node cheating attacks, and fair keyword search issues. In this article, we tackle these challenges by introducing a distributed PHR-sharing scheme based on blockchain and ciphertext policy ABE (CP-ABE), which allows for fast and efficient encryption and decryption. Blockchain maintains the integrity and the tracing source of the data while also recording all operations on the data in the form of transactions. In addition, the blockchain nodes act as attribute authorities to construct the CP-ABE cryptosystem. The tracing of malicious blockchain nodes is realized by tracing cryptography algorithms. Furthermore, the fair retrieval of ciphertext is achieved by employing smart contracts. To overcome the limited storage capacity of blockchain, we adopt both the on-chain and off-chain storage modes in our new system. Security analysis indicates that our new scheme remains intact when threatened by an indistinguishable chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) and an indistinguishable chosen keywords attack (IND-CKA). As such, we conclude that our proposed approach is feasible and efficient.	blockchains;encryption;cryptography;smart contracts;servers;internet of things;cloud computing;attribute-based encryption (abe);blockchain;personal health records (phrs);search;smart contract;tracemulti-authority;keyword search;access-control;encryption;efficient;policy;internet;framework;scheme
1061	协同技术	A DQN-Based Consensus Mechanism for Blockchain in IoT Networks	The integration of the blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) systems can effectively guarantee data security in IoT applications. To facilitate the use of blockchain on resource-constrained IoT end devices, we propose RAFT+ with a new leader selection scheme in this article, which is based on the distributed consensus algorithm RAFT. The design of RAFT+ aims at mitigating the imparities between different types of IoT end devices and enabling these devices to allow different types of IoT end devices to participate in block consensus, thus maintaining strong consistency of the blockchain network. The leader selection scheme is generated by a deep Q-Network (DQN), which can make the optimal selection of the leader under various conditions by leveraging the limited system resources as well as balancing the load of the consensus mechanism on multiple IoT end devices. Simulation results show that RAFT+ can enhance the system performance while maintaining the security of the system under high load conditions.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;deep q-network (dqn);internet of things (iot);raftperformance analysis;internet;algorithm;things;challenges;security;systems;scheme
1062	法律治理	Jurisdictional arbitrage: combatting an inevitable by-product of cryptoasset regulation	Purpose This paper aims to provide an overview of different issues related to jurisdictional arbitrage found in general regulatory arbitrage literature and their projection to the specific area of cryptoasset regulation. Design/methodology/approach By distinguishing any parallel, analogous and neighbouring concepts, this paper attempts to clarify the notion of jurisdictional arbitrage. By discussing certain aspects and effects of three regulatory regimes, BitLicense, 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) and the European Commission's Proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCa), it makes clear that national/State/regional policymakers have already failed to create arbitrage-proof regulatory frameworks by acting exclusively within their jurisdictional limits. Against this background, this paper discusses briefly regulatory competition and international harmonisation as alternative solutions to inappropriate and ineffective national/regional legislative approaches. Findings Based on a structured theoretical analysis, this paper reaches three important findings. First, academics, international bodies and other commentators use inaccurately the general concept of "regulatory arbitrage" to refer to the specific problem of jurisdictional arbitrage creating in this way an interpretative confusion; second, commentators confuse jurisdictional conflicts with jurisdictional arbitrage; third, the solutions to this regulatory problem can actually be found in its underlying causes. Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first specific-issue paper on jurisdictional arbitrage in the context of cryptoasset regulation and aims to trigger further academic discussion on this evolving phenomenon and inform the development of future cryptoasset regulation combatting this problem.	cryptoasset regulation;international harmonisation;regulatory arbitrage;regulatory competition;regulatory regimescompetition;harmonization;bitcoin

We also use the approximate entropy to study their dynamics before COVID-19 and during the pandemic. Results from the mutual information measure indicate a rise in information sharing and ordering in the cryptocurrency markets in the pandemic period, while the evidence from the approximate entropy estimates indicates a rise in randomness during the COVID-19 period. Our results provide new insights on the information sharing of cryptocurrencies and their reaction to shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic.	mutual information;approximate entropy;covid-19 pandemic;cryptocurrenciesmarket;bitcoin;connectedness;dynamics;returns;network

This is a multiscale noise-assisted approach that decomposes any time series into a number of intrinsic mode functions, along with the corresponding instantaneous amplitudes and instantaneous frequencies. The decomposition is adaptive to the time-varying volatility of each cryptocurrency price evolution. Different combinations of modes allow us to reconstruct the time series using components of different timescales. We then apply Hilbert spectral analysis to define and compute the instantaneous energy-frequency spectrum of each cryptocurrency to illustrate the properties of various timescales embedded in the original time series.	time series;empirical mode decomposition;spectral analysis;filtering;volatility;cryptocurrencyempirical mode decomposition;hilbert-huang transform;time-series;unit-root;crude-oil;volatility;bitcoin;ceemd
1065	核心技术	Blockchain Oracles: State-of-the-Art and Research Directions	Blockchain interoperability is an innovative feature of blockchain technology that is rapidly gaining momentum in various fields. The mass adoption of enterprise blockchains has not yet been achieved because blockchain networks act as isolated islands that cannot connect or exchange assets and/or information. In addition, the invocation of smart contracts is restricted only to on-chain executions because of the lack of connectivity between the blockchains. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive and thorough literature review regarding blockchain interoperability, with special highlight on blockchain Oracles being state-of-the-art. Oracles have shown potential as an emerging technology that has revolutionized the blockchain ecosystem by acting as agents that fetch external information into the blockchain ecosystem. A detailed comparative discussion of different blockchain interoperability techniques is presented, showing the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Being overlooked in the literature, the shortcomings of these techniques in comparison to Oracles are identified, addressing how Oracles have succeeded in overcoming many of these limitations. In addition, the literature lacks a focus on the latest market solutions adopting blockchain Oracles, and only a few studies have considered them in detail. This gap has been addressed through an in-depth assessment of the latest market solutions adopting Oracles in the past few years. Finally, design issues trying to achieve the best practices of Oracles, future directions, and identified research gaps are highlighted.	blockchains;interoperability;smart contracts;peer-to-peer computing;business;consensus algorithm;internet of things;blockchain;inter-blockchain;interoperability;oracles;smart contracts
1066	核心技术	A Survey of Blockchain Technology: Architecture, Applied Domains, Platforms, and Security Threats	Blockchain technology is at the peak of hype and contemporary research area across the world. It is a distributed ledger that keeps records of transactions with verifiable and immutable structures and continuously grows with the new block of transactions. Blockchain provides better transparency, enhanced security and privacy, and true traceability over the traditional approaches. Due to its advanced and secure features, it is being used in various fields such as trade finance, digital transactions, the Internet of Things (IoT), the healthcare industry, and energy sector. Blockchain technology has a great impact in all its applied fields with the prominent features of privacy and reliability of data and transactions. This survey intends to present the architecture of blockchain, its potential applications, and practices in different domains other than cryptocurrency along with the platform of blockchain. This paper will explore some potential benefits of blockchain and some future directions and open challenges that are expected to come in future research.	blockchain;hyperledger;internet of thing;cryptocurrency;decentralization;distributed;transparency;immutability;privacy;securitysmart contracts
1067	核心技术	A MCDM-based framework for blockchain consensus protocol selection	Blockchain is one of the most disruptive technologies introduced in Bitcoin, which engaged great attention from the industry and academia and determined a rapid growth of other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs). In the complex architecture of a DLT system, a consensus protocol plays a key role by ensuring that all participants agree on the data integrity without any central authority. A wide range of consensus protocols have been designed with different concepts and properties (e.g., lower energy consumption, better scalability, smaller latency, higher throughput, etc.). The key requirements for consensus protocols passing from one blockchain system to another often differ significantly, and there is no one-fit-all protocol. Therefore, selecting the most suitable consensus protocol for a particular DLT system is essential, but at the same time a challenging step, as decision-makers need to make a trade-off between conflicting requirements. This paper introduces a framework for selecting the most suitable consensus protocols depending on the identified criteria, priorities, and other requirements by incorporating Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques. We demonstrate its potential by identifying the preferable consensuses for the three most common types of existing blockchain systems and on an actual application for bike renting. Moreover, the collected data and tools are freely available, ensuring full replicability, reusability, and further development.	distributed ledger technology (dlt);blockchain;consensus protocol selection;multi-criteria decision-making (mcdm)industry
1068	实体经济	Modeling the enablers for blockchain technology adoption in renewable energy supply chain	The literature illustrates Blockchain Technology (BT) to offer various advantages resulting in progress in the renewable energy supply chains (RESC). It is predicted that BT will bring a novel paradigm in the approach of transactions implemented in the RESC by decreasing the number of intermediaries, delayed payments, and high transaction lead times. As a developing economy, Iran provides the energy needs of an ever-growing population and confronts many issues affecting RESC. As a result, it is, therefore, crucial to accept BT in the RESC to leverage the different advantages. In the current study, we recognize and implement the relationships between the enablers of BT adoption in RESC. Twelve enablers were identified from the literature, and verified by the experts before using a Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modelling (FISM) and Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (FDEMATEL) methodology. The results propose that the comparison among the identified enablers shows the most superior of secure database for BT implementation in RESC tracked by immutability and decentralized database. The results will provide better situations for the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implemented in renewable energy within a real-time data-driven RESC.	blockchain technology;renewable energy supply chain;blockchain enablers;fism;fdematelcapacity credit;smart contract;system;management;design;traceability;future;electricity;challenges;barriers
1069	实体经济	PharmaChain: A blockchain to ensure counterfeit-free pharmaceutical supply chain	Globalisation has facilitated different industries to eliminate geographical boundaries and equipped organisations to work collectively to produce goods. Pharmaceuticals is one such industry which has majorly benefited from globalisation to reduce costs and increase profitability at different aspects of research, development, manufacturing of drugs and finally distribution of drugs. Globalisation not only reduces costs and increases profits for the industry, it also makes essential medication available to all individuals even at remote areas of undeveloped, developing and developed countries. As the number of entities or participants grew in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain (PSC), the complexity and abstractness of the drug delivery from manufacturer to consumer has increased, which raised new concerns like counterfeit medication, incorrect, incomplete or no information about the drug reaching the consumer thus undermining customer confidence and most importantly distribution delays which can cause serious impact on the life of the consumer as well as business growth. Considering all these challenges, there is a dire need for a robust PSC which can eliminate blind parties and provide a transparent chain. A transparent PSC will eliminate data fragmentation between different participating entities by creating a trail of secure, single source of truth for the entire life cycle of a medicine, thereby eliminating the introduction of counterfeits and ensuring the consumer safety. This article proposes a novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based transparent supply chain for PSC and proof-of-concept is implemented to analyse the scalability and efficiency of the proposed architecture. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is one of the technologies which can provide such transparent PSC and Smart Contracts (SC) are the most commonly used component in such systems to implement business logic and access control mechanisms. The proposed PharmaChain model investigates all the interactions between the main entities in PSC and also addresses smart contract issues such as re-entrance, randomness and lacking trustworthy data feed. Results are compared with other proposed solutions for PSC based on DLT.	health;design
1070	协同技术	Combinatorial resources auction in decentralized edge-thing systems using blockchain and differential privacy	With the continuous expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge computing mode has emerged in recent years to overcome the shortcomings of traditional cloud computing mode, such as high delay, network congestion, and large resource consumption. Thus, edge-thing systems will replace the classic cloud-thing/cloud-edge-thing systems and become mainstream gradually, where IoT devices can offload their tasks to neighboring edge nodes. A common problem is how to utilize edge computing resources. For the sake of fairness, double auction can be used in the edge-thing system to achieve an effective resource allocation and pricing mechanism. Due to the lack of third-party management agencies and mutual distrust between nodes, in our edge-thing systems, we introduce blockchains to prevent malicious nodes from tampering with transaction records and smart contracts to act as an auctioneer to realize resources auction. Since the auction results stored in this blockchain-based system are transparent, they are threatened with inference attacks. Thus in this paper, we design a differentially private combinatorial dou-ble auction mechanism by exploring the exponential mechanism such that maximizing the revenue of edge computing platform, in which each IoT device requests a resource bundle and edge nodes compete with each other to provide resources. It can not only guarantee approximate truthfulness and high revenue, but also ensure privacy security. Through nec-essary theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms can be validated.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

1071	核心技术	PROVIDING AUTHENTICATION AND PRIVACY FOR UNIVERSITY CERTIFICATES USING SMART CONTRACTS IN BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY	Traditional ways of distributing and verifying academic certificates are not efficient. Certificates are distributed as hard copy. Verifying the integrity of the certificate is a time and resource consuming process. As a result, forged certificates have become common. It is very difficult to differentiate between a real and a forged certificate. Through our system, we intend to make the certificate generation, distribution, and verification process seamless. Any student can enter his or her personal details, academic coursework details, and the university code, and thus submit a certificate request to the university. University admins can verify the certificate requests, and approve or reject the requests as per their policy. Any student or third party could verify the integrity of the certificate by entering the details of the certificate under scrutiny into the system. Data required to verify the integrity of the certificate will be stored on a blockchain All verification data will be stored on the blockchain, so it will be tamper proof This eliminates or limits the case of forged certificates to a large extend.	blockchain;smart contract;decentralised app
1072	虚拟经济	The Metaverse as a Virtual Form of Data-Driven Smart Urbanism: On Post-Pandemic Governance through the Prism of the Logic of Surveillance Capitalism	The Metaverse, as a gigantic ecosystem application enabled mainly by Artificial Intelligence (AI), the IoT, Big Data, and Extended Reality (XR) technologies, represents an idea of a hypothetical "parallel virtual environment" that incarnates ways of living in virtually inhabitable cities. It is increasingly seen as a transition from smart cities to virtual cities and a new target for city governments to attain "new" goals. However, the Metaverse project was launched amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a crisis purported to be a rare opportunity that should be seized to reset and reimagine the world-though mainly in regard to its digital incarnation, and what this entails in terms of both cementing and normalizing the corporate-led, top-down, technocratic, tech-mediated, algorithmic mode of governance, as well as new forms of controlling ways of living in urban society. The "new normal" has already set the stage for undemocratically resetting and unilaterally reimagining the world, resulting in an abrupt large-scale digital transformation of urban society, a process of digitization and digitalization that is in turn paving the way for a new era of merging virtuality and urbanity. This has raised serious concerns over the risks and impacts of the surveillance technologies that have been rapidly and massively deployed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. These concerns also relate to the global architecture of the computer mediation of the Metaverse upon which the logic of surveillance capitalism depends, and which is constituted by control and commodification mechanisms that seek to monitor, predict, control, and trade the behavior of human users, as well as to exile them from their own. This viewpoint paper explores and questions the Metaverse from the prism of the social and economic logic of surveillance capitalism, focusing on how and why the practices of the post-pandemic governance of urban society are bound to be undemocratic and unethical. The novelty of the viewpoint lies in providing new insights into understanding the dark side of the ostensible fancier successor of the Internet of today, thereby its value and contribution to the ongoing scholarly debates in the field of Science, Technology, and Society (STS). In addition, by shedding light on the emergence of the Metaverse as a computing platform, the viewpoint seeks to help policymakers understand and assess the ramifications of its wide adoption, as well as to help users make informed decisions about its usage in everyday activity-if it actualizes.	metaverse;data-driven smart urbanism;governance;covid-19 pandemic;surveillance capitalism;democracy;privacy;civil liberties;datafication;algorithmization;platformizationdatafication;dimensions;cities;big
1073	虚拟经济	Incoming Metaverses: Digital Mirrors for Urban Planning	The planning process has been, arguably, slow to adapt and adopt new technologies: It is perhaps only now that it is starting to move into a more digitally focused era. Yet, it is not the current thinking around the digital that is going to change planning; it is the emerging metaverse. It is a change on the near horizon that is there but is currently largely unseen in the urban planning profession. The metaverse is, at first sight, a mirror to the current world, a digital twin, but it is more than this: It is an inhabited mirror world where the physical dimensions and rules of time and space do not necessarily apply. Operating across scales, from the change of use of a building up to a local plan and onwards to the scale of future cities, these emerging metaverses will exist either directly within computational space or emerge into our physical space via augmented reality. With economic systems operating via blockchain technology and the ability to instigate aspects of planning law, interspaced with design fiction type scenarios, they represent a new tool kit for the urban planner, spatial, economic, and social. We explore these emerging spaces, taking a look at their origins and how the use of game engines have allowed participation and design to become part of the workflow of these 3D spaces. Via a series of examples, we look at the current state of the art, explore the short term future, and speculate on digital planning using these incoming metaverses 10 years from now.	digital mirrors;meta;metaverse;planning;virtual
1074	虚拟经济	The Future's Not What It Used To Be: Urban Wormholes, Simulation, Participation, and Planning in the Metaverse	In this editorial linked to the thematic issue on "Gaming, Simulations, and Planning: Physical and Digital Technologies for Public Participation in Urban Planning," we explore how urban planning has been, arguably, slow on the uptake of modern technologies and the move towards the next media revolution: The Metaverse is now on the horizon. By artfully pushing technological, cultural, and social boundaries in creating virtual environments, games and gaming technologies have presented interesting opportunities and challenges for the planning profession, theory, and education over the years. This thematic issue documents a wide range of innovative practices in planning enabled by games and gaming technologies. It attempts to open discussions about the way we conceptualize and treat new media and technologies in planning. By providing a wide range of examples, from non-digital games to gamified systems, interactive simulations and digital games, the issue shows that the lack of adoption of these practices has less to do with their technical possibilities and more to do with the way we understand tools and their added value in the dominant narratives of planning. As we note at the end, planning should be at the forefront of these technologies, not embracing technologies for technologies sake but because it should, as a profession, be leading the way into these new environments.	gaming;metaverse;public participation;simulation
1075	实体经济	Lightweight Blockchain Framework For Medical Record Data Integrity	Medical data record from the patient is private data that is very confidential and secure. Securing medical data records using blockchain can prevent unauthorized parties from seeing or changing the data. However, it has a drawback in creating a block known as a mining process that takes a long time and uses enormous resources. We proposed a lightweight blockchain framework for medical record data integrity in using resources that reduce the computational. Based on the work, to build a lightweight blockchain application, the Python programming language is used. The Flask micro web server is applied in illustrating the blockchain data, while the MIT App Inventor creates an Android application to read data from IoT devices. The IoT Implementation of this work has successfully been tested to retrieve data and store it in a blockchain framework. The lightweight blockchain discussed in this paper is a mining technique using leading-zero as a difficulty level factor while ensuring data integrity and security when creating a block. We compared the block-time generation required to make a block on this system with the block-time generation on the existing network such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogelite, and Litecoin. From the difficulty level of one to five, the experiment results, the block-time obtained from 0.0012677 seconds to 34.5919193 seconds. Overall for a low level of difficulty has a faster duration than the existing network. Only at the fifth difficulty level appears to have a longer processing time than Ethereum, but still quicker.	lightweight blockchain;internet of things;sleep apnea;medical record;leading-zeroes
1076	实体经济	Blockchain-based secure delivery of medical supplies using drones	The advantages provided by the drones with regards to three dimensional mobility and ease of deployment makes them a viable candidate for 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. Significant amount of research has been conducted on the aspect of networking for using drones as base stations to provide different services. In this work, we deviate from the traditional use of drones to provide connectivity and explore the delivery of products through drones in the context of maintaining social distancing. However, drone delivery process for critical applications such as delivering medical supplies is vulnerable to attacks such as impersonation attacks. The security of drone operation is important to save the users from any breaches that can lead to financial and physical losses. To cope with these security issues and to make the delivery process transparent, we propose a blockchain-based drone delivery system that registers and authenticates the participating entities including products (medical supplies), warehouse (medical centers) and drones. To this end, we utilize Ethereum platform for implementation of blockchain and smart contract and we present an analysis of different factors that influence the authentication process in terms of time and the number of transactions. Furthermore, to make the communication of a drone with command and control center more secure and robust, we use machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection system.	unmanned aerial vehicles;blockchain;machine learning;fifth generation (5g) and beyonduav communications
1077	协同技术	Amaurotic-Entity-Based Consensus Selection in Blockchain-Enabled Industrial IoT	In this article, we propose a dynamic-consensus-based blockchain system-A-Blocks-for efficiently managing the data produced by the sensors in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. Typically, industries deal with a heterogeneous set of data from a diverse range of sensors. Conventional blockchain adoptions are a popular choice in such scenarios for data security while satisfying both transparency and immutability. However, stringent consensus algorithms are inadequate for managing heterogeneous data, especially due to its implicit constraints. For instance, while PoW provides inevitable security and is highly distributive, it is not scalable and requires more energy. In contrast, PoS is energy efficient but has reduced scalability and PBFT is suitable for faster processing. A-Blocks exploits the features of the available consensus algorithms and dynamically selects the best one in real time. It operates in two phases: 1) categorizing the data into groups based on their traits and then 2) selecting the appropriate consensus algorithm. Extensive experimental results using open industrial data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of A-Blocks with 8% CPU and 78% memory consumptions on resource-constrained devices. Furthermore, compared to the existing methods, although A-Blocks increases energy consumption by 11%, it also reduces mining time by 7%.	blockchains;consensus algorithm;industrial internet of things;sensors;security;scalability;middleware;agglomerative clustering;blockchain;consensus algorithms;industrial internet of things (iiot)system
1078	核心技术	ESM: Selfish mining under ecological footprint	By deviating from an honest mining strategy, attackers can obtain additional rewards through mining attacks. Selfish mining is the most well-known mining attack. It includes selfish mining (SM1), optimal selfish mining (E-optimal), and bribed selfish mining (BSM), etc. The mining models addressed in prior studies, however, are based on the Nakamoto consensus. Therefore, this paper proposes the ESM model (Selfish Mining under Ecological model). Our new model is fully compatible with fewer resource expenditure requirements. Meanwhile, we also describe a novel selfish mining attack that allows the malicious pool to gain additional revenue by using an ESM attack rather than SM1 when its power is less than 25%. Furthermore, we present an EBSM (Bribery Selfish Mining under Ecological) attack that combines ESM together with the bribery attack. As a result, under EBSM, the malicious solo miner has a chance to gain additional revenue. Finally, we undertake quantitative analyses and simulations to assess the effectiveness of our attacks.

The results show multiple bubble episodes in both cryptocurrencies, with a more frequent occurrence in Bitcoin. Collapse episodes are only observed in Bitcoin. We relate price explosivity to Elon Musk's tweets. His cryptocurrency-related general tweets have contributed to the price explosivity of Bitcoin, whereas his Dogecoin-specific tweets have contributed to price explosivity in Dogecoin. Our findings highlight the influential role of key persons through social media on the formation of bubbles, which matters to the decision-making of cryptotraders and market efficiency.	bubbles;bsadf test;bitcoin;dogecoin;twitter;covid-19bitcoin;attention;bubbles

Further, in the cryptocurrency market, it is vital to predict the Bitcoin price, which leads to high budgetary advantages and fences against market risks. This paper introduces a new bitcoin prediction model that includes three major phases: data collection, Feature Extraction, and Prediction. The initial phase is data collection, where Bitcoin raw data are collected, from which the features are extracted in the Features Extraction phase. The feature extraction is a unique mechanism for detecting the bitcoin prices on day-by-day and minute-by-minute. The indexed data collected are computed regarding certain standard indicators like average true range, exponential moving average, relative strength index, and rate of change. These technical indicators based features are subjected to the prediction phase. As the major contribution, the prediction process is made precisely by deploying an improved deep belief network model, whose weights and activation function are fine-tuned using a new modified Lion Algorithm referred to as Lion Algorithm with Adaptive Price Size. Finally, the performance of the proposed work is compared and proved its superiority over other conventional models.	cryptocurreny;bitcoin price prediction;technical indicators;deep belief network;lion algorithm with adaptive price size algorithmneural-networks
1081	市场治理	Examining the interrelatedness of NFTs, DeFi tokens and cryptocurrencies	The high volatility of the blockchain markets has driven the attention of investors and market participants to concentrate on the diversification avenues of NFTs, DeFi Tokens, and Cryptocurrencies. We examined the extreme risk transmission of blockchain markets using the quantile connectedness technique at the median, extreme low, and extreme high volatility conditions. We find significant risk spillovers among blockchain markets with strong disconnection of NFTs. Meanwhile, time-varying features characterized various uneven economic circumstances. Overall, NFTs offer greater diversification avenues with substantial risk-bearing potential among other blockchain markets to shelter the investments and minimize extreme risks.	blockchain markets;diversification;extreme risk spillovers;quantile connectedness
1082	市场治理	Framework based on multiplicative error and residual analysis to forecast bitcoin intraday-volatility	This paper deals with bitcoin volatility forecasting, through a framework based on Long-Short Term Memory, multiplicative error and residual analysis. This framework is based on modeling the nonlinear behavior of the multiplicative error in order to improve forecast accuracy. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency market, its high volatility and its applications in different commercial transactions have attracted the attention of academics and investors. Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is the one with the highest volume of trading. For this reason, it is important for investors and companies that use bitcoin as a means of payment to be able to predict its volatility more accurately. Nonetheless, this presents a great challenge given the chaotic behavior of the bitcoin volatility series. The results indicate that the proposed model is able to better capture non-linear behavior of the volatility time series, allowing a more accurate forecast in terms of MSE. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

1083	市场治理	Forecasting Bitcoin returns with long short-term memory networks and wavelet decomposition: A comparison of several market determinants	Investigating Bitcoin price forecasting has attracted academic attention recently. However, despite some studies on potential economic determinants of Bitcoin price, a consensus on the best predictors is not reached yet. This paper investigates different predictors from various markets including Gold, Oil, S&P500, VIX, USDI, Ether and Ripple as well as Bitcoin historical price in predicting one-step-ahead Bitcoin returns. We propose a two-stage forecasting that comprises discrete wavelet transform as the decomposition method and a deep long short-term memory network as the forecasting algorithm. Beside analyzing forecasting for both univariate and multivariate regression, we design a simulated trading system to put the forecasts into practice and analyze the economic profitability of the predictors. In addition, we shed light on the black box method by implementing sensitivity analysis. To investigate the predictors' efficacy through time and consider the effects of early 2018 price spike, the dataset is split into two periods: (1) prior to and including the spike and (2) after the spike. According to the experiments, it is hard to choose one predictor over the other in the first period. However, in the second period, Gold and Oil show the highest statistical accuracy, while S&P500 is the most profit-making predictor. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

This finding advocates new understandings beyond the mainstream conclusion that network connections increase with similarity. It is also found that message networks offer significant implications to distinguish between accurate information and noise. Evidence shows that popular messages frequently quoted by others and redundant messages confirmed from different sources contain more accurate information for Bitcoin market predictions.

1085	市场治理	A coin selection strategy based on the greedy and genetic algorithm	Coin selection method refers to the process undergone when selecting a set of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) from a cryptocurrency wallet or account to use as inputs in each transaction. The most applied coin selection method that UTXO-based cryptocurrencies currently employ is an algorithm that decides on a certain set of UTXOs that matches the target amount and limits the transaction fee. However this approach trades off favourable maintenance overhead of the entire network for low transaction fees, as many low-value UTXOs known as "dust" is produced. Over time, this will impact the scalability and management of the cryptocurrency network as the global set of UTXOs become larger. Therefore, there is an urgency to find a higher-performing coin selection method suitable for UTXO-based cryptocurrencies. This paper proposes a method based on the greedy and genetic algorithm for effectively choosing sets of UTXOs in Bitcoin. The main objective of this coin selection strategy is to get as close as possible to the target while also maintaining and possibly reducing the number of UTXO inputs.	coin selection;utxo;bitcoin transaction;block size;greedy algorithm;genetic algorithm

The empirical results show the deviation between actual and implied rates of EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and JPY/USD affects the movements of actual and BTC-implied rates. We observe that implied rates contribute more to price discovery than actual rates before 2019 for EUR/USD and before 2018 for JPY/USD. Triangular arbitrage opportunities arise when VIX is high. The arbitrage opportunities are also related to the market capitalization of bitcoin and the trading of bitcoin futures on CBOE and CME.	triangular arbitrage;bitcoin;fiat money;price discoverymacroeconomic news;long-memory;bitcoin;futures;announcements;dollar;hedge;gold;spot

We employ daily returns of Bitcoin, Gold, DJIA, CAC40, NSE50, S&P 500, NASDAQ, and EURO-STOXX from 05-01-2015 to 31-12-2020. Our results show that Gold consistently exhibits safe haven properties for all the markets except NSE in the long and short run, while Bitcoin provided mixed results. We find that Gold can act as an effective hedge and diversifier as well.	gold;bitcoin;safe-haven;wavelet;quantile correlation;covid-19connectedness;stocks;hedge;bonds;risk

I document that the potential composite use of margin trading and short selling is associated with lower market price efficiency. Moreover, I find that more likely short selling relative to margin trading is positively related to market efficiency indicating that margin trading causes their negative composite effect. If margin traders are more likely sophisticated retail investors, the negative impact of margin trading is less pronounced.	market price efficiency;retail investors;short selling;margin trading;bitcoininformational efficiency;stock;requirements;volatility;inefficiency;discovery

The results provide strong evidence that using a forecasting model that incorporates continuous-time jump and two-stage regimes can significantly improve predictive accuracy and achieve high economic gains. Interestingly, the superior forecasting ability of the model with a continuous-time jump is reflected in highly volatile periods, especially in the period of a Black Swan event.	bitcoin volatility;markov-regime switching;jump;mixed data sampling modelcommodity
1090	市场治理	Testing for market efficiency in cryptocurrencies: evidence from a non-linear conditional quantile framework	This study tests for the weak-form market efficiency of 15 cryptocurrency prices. The conventional unit root tests and stationary test results reveal that most cryptocurrency markets are efficient markets. However, the non-linear quantile unit root test proposed by Li and Park (2018) rejects the unit root null hypothesis over the whole quantile level. To derive more informative ideas, we split the whole quantile interval to several sub-intervals and find asymmetric behaviour of the market efficiency across the lower and upper sub-intervals in several cryptocurrency markets. Moreover, non-linear quantile unit root tests for Chainlink, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, EOS, Tron, and Stellar indicate that markets for these cryptocurrencies are efficient at the upper sub-intervals.	efficient market hypothesis;bitcoin;cryptocurrency;non-linear unit root test;quantile interval unit root testoil-price shock;unit-root;great crash;time-series;inefficiency;bitcoin;hypothesis
1091	市场治理	The tail dependence structure between return and trading volume: an investigation on the Bitcoin market	This research assesses the diversification patterns for tail dependence between Bitcoin return and trading volume by utilizing a dynamic mixture copula approach with spillover effect and asymmetric volatility effect. There are four main empirical findings. First, the spillover effect between return and trading volume exists. Second, the leverage effect is statistically significant for return and trading volume. Third, the linkages between return and trading volume are diversified. Both positive and negative tail dependence structures are observed, and the frequency of a positive tail dependence occurring is higher. Furthermore, the asymmetric tail dependence structure exists in positive and negative dependence situations. In the positive dependence structure, a co-movement in the increasing direction is stronger than a co-movement in the decreasing direction. In the negative dependence structure, a situation of a large return with low volume occurs more often than a situation of a small return with high volume. Fourth, the volatility of trading volume positively predicts the magnitude of positive dependence.	bitcoin;return;trading volume;mixture copula;tail dependenceprice changes;model

In this paper, we investigate the herding behaviour of two types of cryptocurrencies, referred to as "black/dirty" and "green/clean" based on their energy usage levels. Empirical results reveal that herding generally exists only in the dirty cryptocurrency market, and is more significant in down markets. Moreover, we find that clean cryptocurrencies do herd, but with dirty cryptocurrencies, when the two markets are both positive. Our findings are robust across value and equal-weighted portfolios and provide valuable insights to investors and policy makers.	herding;cryptocurrencies;sustainable cryptocurrency;bitcoinbehavior
1093	协同技术	Bift: A Blockchain-Based Federated Learning System for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles	Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.	blockchains;servers;data models;collaborative work;training;computational modeling;autonomous vehicles;blockchain;connected and autonomous vehicles (cavs);consensus algorithm;federated learning (fl);off-chain storage
1094	核心技术	PoEC: A Cross-Blockchain Consensus Mechanism for Governing Blockchain by Blockchain	The research on the governing blockchain by blockchain supervision system is an important development trend of blockchain technology. In this system there is a supervisory blockchain managing and governing the supervised blockchain based on blockchain technology, results in a uniquely cross-blockchain demand to consensus mechanism for solving the trust problem between supervisory blockchain and supervised blockchain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a cross-blockchain consensus mechanism based on smart contract and a set of smart contracts endorse the crossblockchain consensus. New consensus mechanism called Proof-of-EndorseContracts (PoEC) consensus, which firstly transfers the consensus reached in supervisory blockchain to supervised blockchain by supervisory nodes, then packages the supervisory block in supervisory blockchain and transmits it to the smart contract deployed in the supervised blockchain, finally miners in supervised blockchain will execute and package the new block according to the status of the smart contract. The core part of the consensus mechanism is Endorse Contracts which designed and implemented by us and verified the effectiveness through experiments. PoEC consensus mechanism and Endorse Contracts support the supervised blockchain to join the governing blockchain by blockchain system without changing the original consensus mechanism, which has the advantages of low cost, high scalability and being able to crossblockchain. This paper proves that our method can provide a feasible crossblockchain governance scheme for the field of blockchain governance.	proof-of-endorse-contracts;poec;cross-blockchain consensus mechanism;governing blockchain by blockchainalgorithm;iot
1095	核心技术	A hybrid consensus algorithm for master-slave blockchain in a multidomain conversation system	Conversation systems play an important role in the research and development of multidomain systems, in which the number of conversations increases rapidly with the number of domains. Multiple experts must maintain these conversation interactions, otherwise experts from different domains are unable to interact properly. For this reason, ensuring secure and efficient cooperation between different experts has become a serious issue that needs to be resolved. This study proposes a hybrid consensus algorithm for a master-slave chain to improve the efficiency and scalability of multidomain conversation interactions. Firstly, we build a master-slave chain model for a multidomain conversation system which can be applied to process multiple conversation interactions from different domains concurrently. Subsequently, a new hybrid consensus algorithm is proposed which combines reputation-driven voting, dynamic construction strategies and an incentive scheme with both economic and noneconomic rewards. Implemented and tested on a local private blockchain network, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, in order to offer a decentralised, scalable, multidomain conversation system in a secure manner.	consensus algorithm;master-slave;blockchain;multidomain;conversation system
1096	实体经济	TPPSUPPLY : A traceable and privacy-preserving blockchain system architecture for the supply chain	Traceability and auditability are key structures in supply chain management and construction. However, trust is the most important aspect of customers in these systems. Also, relying on third parties to trade in centralized systems is indispensable. Although current exist frameworks for these solutions in the supply chain, these have work poor traceability and lack of real-time information, and especially lack of privacy. In this article, we propose a framework for supply chain traceability that preserves privacy from third parties by using smart contracts. In the proposed framework, digital signature and verification are provided by using existing cryptographic techniques in off-chain and on-chain smart contract integration, and it is demonstrated the applicability of architecture by testing. The architecture also provides both anonymity and traceability depending on the user's request. Finally, thanks to traceability and auditability in the proposed system, customers and other parties can view with a single product ID and also verify with digital signature the claims of the actors in the system.	blockchain;supply chain;privacy;traceability;smart contract;off-chaintechnology;management;identification
1097	实体经济	Blockchain in accounting, accountability and assurance: an overview	Purpose This study aims to present an overview of topics addressed in the papers appearing in this AAAJ special issue: Blockchain in accounting, accountability and assurance. Design/methodology/approach The authors present a review focussing on the papers published in this special issue. The authors imported the eight accepted papers into NVivo, coding them according to the research topics posed in the call for papers. Then, the authors conducted an in vivo coding for the emerging themes found in the papers. Findings Blockchain is a multifaced topic with multiple implications for accounting, auditing and accountability, the accounting professions, and governance. However, blockchain is still a developing topic. Blockchain research traditionally has four stages. More recently, a new research stage deserving more investigation is emerging based on the interaction of blockchain with other technological developments such as virtual reality and the metaverse. Originality/value The review not only uncovers and systematises the multiple implications of blockchain for accounting research. It also unveils the dark side of blockchain, focusing on the technology's negative environmental and social implications. Last, the authors highlight why accounting research should more extensively examine contemporary issues.	blockchain;accounting;auditing;accountability;professions;governance;dark side;blockchain 5;0
1098	法律治理	Tokenized: The Law of Non-Fungible Tokens and Unique Digital Property	Markets for unique digital property-digital equivalents of rare artworks, collectible trading cards, and other assets that gain value from scarcity-have exploded in the past few years. At root is the next iteration of blockchain technology, unique digital assets called non-fungible tokens. Unlike bitcoin, where one coin is the same as another, NFTs are unique, each with different attributes. An NFT that represented ownership of Boardwalk would be quite different from one that represented Baltic Avenue. NFTs have grown from a few early breakout successes to a rapidly developing market for unique digital treasures. The attraction to buyers is that, unlike digital assets like e-books or licensed movies, NFTs can be bought, sold, displayed, gifted, or even destroyed just like personal property. Yet law has not kept pace with demand for unique digital property. In particular, the rules designed for the 2000s internet focused on expanding intellectual property licenses and online contracts to the point that consumers are mere users, not owners, of digital assets. This "end of ownership" legal structure stands in stark contrast to the expectations of those who create, buy, sell, and invest in NFTs. This article proposes a clear path for the evolution of the legal underpinnings of NFTs. It argues that NFTs are personal property, not contracts (despite the "smart contracts" popular nomenclature) or pure intellectual property licenses (despite the currently governing law of digital assets like e-books). Because transactions in NFTs are in the form of a sale, the law of sales of personal property should apply. And finally, the article notes that NFTs will serve as a powerful, grounding example of digital personal property, a legal form of ownership that is both sorely needed and has not yet been clearly established online. That example will ground others, and permit law to again characterize those who buy scarce and valuable digital assets as true owners rather than mere users.

The article is an encounter with these virtual worlds, particularly as they are manifested in the haute couture of the French haute couturier Julian Fournie. To understand Fournie's haute couture, and thus to build a foundation for an interpretation of his most important fashion ideas, it is argued that researchers need to explore Fournie's engagement with virtual worlds and augmented reality from the perspective of German philosopher Martin Heidegger's phenomenological explanation of thinking and rethinking, and then at how Fournie develops and revises the meaning of haute couture.	julien fournie;haute couture;metaverse;rethinking;thinking;virtual worlds
1101	实体经济	A machine learning and blockchain based secure and cost-effective framework for minor medical consultations	With the ever-increasing awareness among people regarding their health, visiting a doctor has become quite common. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, home-based consultations are gaining popularity. Nevertheless, the worries over privacy and the lack of willingness to assist patients by the medical professionals in the online consultation process have made current models ineffective. In this paper, we present an advanced protected blockchain-based consultation model for minor medical conditions. Our model not only ensures users' privacy but by incorporating a calculation model, it also offers an opportunity for consulting end-users to voluntarily take part in the consultation process. Our work proposes a smart contract based on machine learning to be implemented for the prediction of a score of a professional who consults based on various prioritized parameters. This is done by using word2vec and TF-IDF weighting to classify the question and cosine similarity scores for detailed orientation analysis. Based on this score, the patient is charged, and simultaneously, the responder is awarded ether. An incentivized method leads to more accessible healthcare while reducing the cost itself.	machine learning;nlp;naive bayes;logistic regression;minor consultations;ethereum;blockchainhealth-care;attitudes;chain;gps
1102	市场治理	Is Bitcoin a hedge? How extreme volatility can destroy the hedge property	A large literature tests whether Bitcoin can hedge portfolio risk, i.e. reduce the risk if added to a portfolio. Intuitively, given the extreme volatility and thus risk of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the idea that Bitcoin is a hedge may be puzzling. Indeed, we show that for extreme levels of volatility, Bitcoin does not reduce the risk if added to a benchmark equity portfolio. This is not only true on average but also holds for sub-samples, including the COVID-19 crisis period. We conclude that a focus on correlations is not sufficient for extreme levels of volatility.	bitcoin;hedge;portfolio diversifiersafe haven;gold;dollar

Taking a relative emission perspective and utilizing the mean-variance portfolio optimization framework, we study the financial and carbon-related implications of Bitcoin investments. The results of our in-sample analysis show that adding Bitcoin to a diversified equity portfolio can both enhance the risk-return relationship of the portfolio and reduce the portfolio's aggregate carbon emissions. This finding persists under various assumptions regarding Bitcoin prices, carbon emission estimates, and carbon prices.	cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;carbon emissions;climate change;carbon intensity;mean-variance analysisenergy;diversification
1104	虚拟经济	A blockchain-based infection tracing and notification system by non-fungible tokens	SARS-CoV2 pandemic is heavily affecting our lives. Many actions have been undertaken to slow down its expansion and, among the others, contact tracing applications are the less invasive to monitor the spread of the virus. The idea behind contact tracing is to track contacts between people by the exchange of identifiers, not linked to individuals, exploiting the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to estimate the duration and proximity of contacts. The data collected in this way is used for the sole purpose of notifying a potential contact with an infected person without revealing their identity and location. This paper presents a contact tracing protocol based on blockchain technology that exploits smart contracts for reporting contacts at risk of contagion. The novelty of the proposed solution is the use of Non Fungible Tokens (NFT) to guarantee user privacy through a decentralized approach, equipped with a reliable non-proprietary notification mechanism that allows public access to anonymous infections data.	blockchain;contact tracing;smart contract;erc721;sars-cov2
1105	虚拟经济	The economic value of NFT: Evidence from a portfolio analysis using mean-variance framework	We investigate whether the inclusion of NFTs in portfolio investing in traditional assets provides a significant diversification benefit for constructing a well-diversified portfolio. We examine Pearson's correlation, the Gerber Statistic for co-movement, and the spillover index for volatility transmission. Our findings suggest that NFTs are distinct from traditional assets, potentially resulting in portfolio diversification. Using the mean-variance approach, empirical results demonstrate there exist a statistically significant evidence that the inclusion of NFTs improves the performance of equally weighted and tangency portfolio strategies in terms of Sharpe ratio. It confirms that NFTs have a diversification effect on the traditional asset-based portfolios.	non-fungible tokens;portfolio analysis;mean-variance framework;the diversification effectvolatility spillovers;return;connectedness;uncertainty;bitcoin

We introduce the basic concepts of blockchain and smart contracts and explain how some of their features are enabled. We review several typical or novel applications of blockchain and smart contract technologies and their enabling concepts and underlying technologies. We classify the selected literature into five categories and discuss their motivations and technical designs. We recognize that the trend of decentralization creates a need to use blockchain and smart contracts to implement trust and distributed control mechanisms. We also speculate on future applications of blockchain and smart contracts. We believe that, in the future, blockchains with different consensus mechanisms will be studied and applied to achieve more efficient and practical decentralized systems. Also, blockchain-based smart contracts will be more widely applied to enhance autonomous distributed controls in decentralized systems.	blockchain;smart contract;chemical industry;internet of things;knowledge graphof-the-art;smart contract;knowledge graph;energy;system;management;state;power;city;microgrids
1107	核心技术	Blockchain-Based Reliable Traceability System for Telecom Big Data Transactions	Telecom big data generated by telecom networks have a high economic value. Thus, telecom operators actively explore telecom big data transactions methods to minimize the possibility of leaking users' privacy. The existing solutions do not allow the data sets to leave the database, instead only allow the buyers to send data mining algorithms to the telecom operator's platform for training. However, this centralized platform has a high risk of tampering. In addition, the currently existing solutions cannot be used to accurately and quickly trace the information of telecom big data transactions. To address these limitations, we propose a blockchain-based reliable traceability system for telecom big data transactions using smart contracts and the InterPlanetary File System. Two types of smart contracts are developed to store transaction information for tracing. Access control strategies and a reapproval prevention strategy are designed for ensuring the safe operation of the system and avoiding the problem of favoritism and fraud. We use Ethereum as a verification platform to develop and evaluate this system. The implementation of functions, such as purchasing data sets, sending algorithms, obtaining results, and tracing transactions in the smart contract and the implementation of the proposed strategies are verified. The results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed system is better than the existing solutions, and the traceability response time is improved to the order of seconds, so as to realize the safe and efficient traceability of telecom big data transactions. In addition, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 were discussed to provide insights for future development.	telecommunications;big data;blockchains;data privacy;smart contracts;internet of things;reliability;blockchain;smart contract;telecom big data transactions;traceability
1108	协同技术	An Enhanced Security System Using Blockchain Technology for Strong FMC Relationship	Blockchain technology is a shared database of logs of all consumer transactions which are registered on all machines on a network. Both transactions in the system are carried out by consensus processes and to preserve confidentiality all the files contained cannot be changed. Blockchain technology is the fundamental software behind digital currencies like Bitcoin, which is common in the marketplace. Cloud computing is a method of using a network of external machines to store, monitor, and process information, rather than using the local computer or a local personal computer. The software is currently facing multiple problems including lack of data protection, data instability, and reliability. This paper aims to give the highest security for multiple user environments in cloud for storing and accessing the data in blocks. The users who are legitimate are only allowed for storing and accessing the data as like a secured block chain approach. As like the Blockchain which does not require a centralized system for transactions, the proposed system is also independent on centralized network interface. The decentralized system is developed in such a way to avoid counterfeiting. The system enables the fabricator to spend less or null resources to perform the validations for its direct operated stores. This ensures the product fabricator to avoid the circulation of its duplicate products. The customer as an end-user is also ensured to have only the genuine products from the fabricator. The Fabricator (F), Merchant (M) and consumer (C) forms an interconnected triangular structure without allowing any counterfeiting agents in their secured cloud chain. The proposed approach provides the stability in the security system of the cloud using the chaining mechanism within different blocks at each node. It takes roughly 4.7, 6.2, and 7.5 ms, respectively, to register each node in the proposed system for 5, 10, and 15 nodes. The overall registration time for each scenario is 11.9, 26.2, and 53.1 ms, despite the fact that each node's registration time was greatest for 10 nodes. By looking at the data, it's clear that the number of nodes is a function of time.	blockchain;bitcoin;customer;merchant;data protection;digital currencies;transactionmulti-authority;access-control
1109	虚拟经济	A Study on Satisfaction with Virtual Object Manipulation in Metaverse Based On Mixed Reality	As people begin to notice metaverse, various metaverse applications have been implemented. Mixed reality (MR) is one of the representative technologies used to implement metaverse applications. MR-based metaverse application makes users achieve goals by manipulating a virtual object. Since virtual object manipulation is the main means to achieve the goals, the satisfaction of the virtual object manipulation can have a major influence on the overall satisfaction of the application. Conventional studies on MR-based metaverse applications mainly focused on developing a metaverse application with a specific purpose and evaluating the satisfaction of the developed application. However, studies on the effect of virtual object manipulation on user satisfaction considering the characteristics of MR are insufficient. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the satisfaction with virtual object manipulation in metaverse based on MR. For this, experiments using virtual objects were conducted on the subjects, and the results were analyzed. Satisfaction were analyzed based on two properties (manipulation property and virtual object property). Manipulation type, object moving type, object position, object size, and object color showed significant differences, whereas object scaling type did not show significant differences.	metaverse;mixed reality;virtual object manipulation;satisfactionsystem

At present, the development of the metaverse is still in the early stage, and there lacks a framework for the visual construction and exploration of the metaverse. In this paper, we propose a framework that summarizes how graphics, interaction, and visualization techniques support the visual construction of the metaverse and user-centric exploration. We introduce three kinds of visual elements that compose the metaverse and the two graphical construction methods in a pipeline. We propose a taxonomy of interaction technologies based on interaction tasks, user actions, feedback and various sensory channels, and a taxonomy of visualization techniques that assist user awareness. Current potential applications and future opportunities are discussed in the context of visual construction and exploration of the metaverse. We hope this paper can provide a stepping stone for further research in the area of graphics, interaction and visualization in the metaverse. (C) 2022 The Authors.

1111	虚拟经济	Is Metaverse in education a blessing or a curse: a combined content and bibliometric analysis	The Metaverse has been the centre of attraction for educationists for quite some time. This field got renewed interest with the announcement of social media giant Facebook as it rebranding and positioning it as Meta. While several studies conducted literature reviews to summarize the findings related to the Metaverse in general, no study to the best of our knowledge focused on systematically summarizing the finding related to the Metaverse in education. To cover this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of the Metaverse in education. It then applies both content and bibliometric analysis to reveal the research trends, focus, and limitations of this research topic. The obtained findings reveal the research gap in lifelogging applications in educational Metaverse. The findings also show that the design of Metaverse in education has evolved over generations, where generation Z is more targeted with artificial intelligence technologies compared to generation X or Y. In terms of learning scenarios, there have been very few studies focusing on mobile learning, hybrid learning, and micro learning. Additionally, no study focused on using the Metaverse in education for students with disabilities. The findings of this study provide a roadmap of future research directions to be taken into consideration and investigated to enhance the adoption of the Metaverse in education worldwide, as well as to enhance the learning and teaching experiences in the Metaverse.	metaverse;cyber worlds;virtual worlds;avatar;artificial intelligence;digital twin;mirror worldvirtual world;experiences;students;hybrid;system
1112	虚拟经济	What the Metaverse Is (Really) and Why We Need to Know About It	Major technology companies are investing significant sums of money in the creation of the metaverse whose main feature will be the fusion between the virtual world and the physical world. To allow this possibility is one of the less obvious features of the metaverse: the metaverse works like our minds. This ability makes the metaverse a significantly different technology from its predecessors. If television and social media are persuasive technologies, because of their ability to influence people's attitudes and behaviors, the metaverse is instead a transformative technology, capable of modifying what people think reality is. To achieve this goal, the technologies of the metaverse hack different key cognitive mechanisms: the experience of being in a place and in a body, the processes of brain-to-brain attunement and synchrony, and the ability of experiencing and inducing emotions. Clearly, these possibilities define totally new scenarios with positive and negative outcomes. Educating ourselves as to its promise, and the challenges it may present, is a necessity. This requires a "humane," integrated, and multidisciplinary approach, with stakeholders at the supranational level joining in the conversation.	metaverse;virtual reality;augmented reality;predictive coding;brain-to-brain synchrony;emotion regulationvirtual-reality;artificial-intelligence

Evidence from non-parametric causality-in-quantiles techniques	This research examines the impact of the COVID-19 on cryptocurrencies' connectedness by employing two techniques: TVP-VAR-based connectedness and causality in the quantiles. First, the TVP-VAR-based connectedness unveils that cryptocurrencies act as a net receiver and transmitter of shocks, with Bitcoin, Ethereum are the highest transmitters among others. Moreover, the causality-in-quantile test shows that COVID-19 significantly causes spillover connectedness among cryptocurrencies, mainly at the quantiles ranging from 0.1 to 0.8, while an insignificant causal relationship is found in few cases. The study has implications for investors and policymakers.	covid-19;cryptocurrencies;tvp-var;causality-in-quantiles techniqueuncertainty
1114	市场治理	Central bank digital currency: A review and some macro-financial implications	Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) have attracted considerable interest and its deployment on a global scale is imminent. However, CBDC face several challenges. They include: legal, technological, and political considerations. We summarize those challenges and add a few more that have not received much attention in the literature. We then focus on two forms of CBDC: a narrow version that only replaces notes and coins and a broader form with a deposit feature. The narrow CBDC is the most likely one to be first introduced. Next, relying on evidence of past episodes of financial innovation, and using cross-country data, we explore the hypothetical impact of CBDC on inflation and financial stability, based on the historical behaviour of the velocity of circulation and incorporating a CBDC's impact using McCallum's policy rule which sets the stance of monetary policy based on money growth. Our simulations suggest that CBDC need not produce higher inflation, but financial stability remains at risk. We provide some policy implications.	central bank digital currency;velocity;money demand;monetary policy;mccallum ruleinstitutional change;money;velocity;policies;cost

In fact, it can be divided into legal digital currency and non-legal digital currency depending to whether the digital currency is issued by the competent authority. China's legal digital currency (DC/EP) has implemented early and already has a certain scale of development. This article examines the legal issues that arise from the implementation of a legal digital currency in China, issues that Chinese lawmakers inevitably face. These legal issues may arise at both domestic and international levels, such as personal privacy protection, currency sovereignty conflicts, potential cross-border crimes risks. This article emphasizes that on the one hand, the development of legal digital currency must be carried out within a reasonable legal framework to avoid new systemic risks caused by the development of technology. On the other hand, it is also necessary for China to put in place as soon as possible an appropriate legal framework, explore the international cooperation of diversified supervision as well to ensure the healthy development of legal digital currency.	central bank digital currency (cbdc);dc/ep;legal challenges;financial supervision;international cooperation

There is a long history of trading stamps and loyalty points, but new technologies are poised to sharply raise the significance of redeemable assets as a store of value. Here, we develop a simple stylized model of redeemable tokens that can be used to study sales and pricing strategies for issuing tokens, including ICOs. Our central finding is that platforms can potentially earn higher revenues by making tokens non-tradable unless they can generate a sufficiently high outside-platform convenience yield.	digital currencies;platforms;tokens;initial coin offering;e42;g23;l51
1118	市场治理	What's in a Name?: The Classification of 'Interest' on Crypto-assets in South Africa and Beyond	Decentralized finance (DeFi) represents a specific application of crypto-asset technology that has made significant advancements in adoption. While academic tax literature has focused on basic crypto-asset transactions, the tax consequences of DeFi transactions have been much less frequently explored. This study considers whether income or expenditure arising in specific DeFi transactions might be classified as interest in terms of South African income tax legislation as well as within the international tax context. Classification as interest has significant implications. Within South African domestic legislation, it impacts the determination of source, quantification of amounts, timing of recognition, application of exemptions, and imposition of withholding tax. Internationally, it has implications for the determination of jurisdictional taxing rights under double tax agreements. This study proposes that, while historically, interest may have been thought of exclusively as arising in the context of monetary debt, this is not a definitive characteristic of interest. Rather, interest represents remuneration for the provision of capital in the form of a loan principal with a contractual right to repayment. Whether each of these elements is present in the cases of the identified DeFi transactions is inconclusive. The study therefore recommends the provision of guidance to taxpayers by South Africa and other jurisdictions, and supports a coordinated approach among jurisdictions in the determination of income tax outcomes.	crypto-asset;cryptocurrency;decentralized finance;defi;income classification;income tax;interest;makerdao;oecd model tax convention;south africablockchain;taxation

In doing so, it will examine the next generation of blockchain technology, including smart contracts, decentralised financial applications, and permissioned networks, and how these technologies may be used to support secured cryptocurrency lending transactions. The article proposes two models suitable for adoption and contends that smart contracts as supported by the Ethereum blockchain provides the most ideal structure for contracting parties in such transactions. However, a major inhibitor in its realisation is the current Australian legislative framework, which is outdated and inadequate in supporting novel technologies. Recommendations on how legislators may overcome these limitations are provided. The use of cryptocurrencies in collateralised lending presents an opportunity for prospective lenders to expand their borrowing base, and unlocks an additional avenue for borrowers in attaining finance.

Using a sample of 9 DeFi tokens, 3 NFTs, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, we detect several bubbles overlapping the examined cryptoassets. We also uncover DeFi and NFT-specific bubbles in Summer 2020 suggesting distinct driving factors for this class of assets. We document that DeFi and NFTs bubbles are less recurrent but have higher magnitudes than cryptocurrencies' bubbles. We also find that COVID-19 and trading volume exacerbate bubble occurrences, while Total Value Locked (TVL) is negatively associated with cryptoassets' bubbles. Our results suggest that TVL can be used as a tool for market monitoring.	covid-19;defi;nfts;total value locked;digital bubbles;real-time detectionbitcoin;market

The design and analysis of an optimal policy computing algorithm for smart contracts within the blockchain will be the focus. Inside the system, each order associated with a demand may simultaneously require multiple service items from different suppliers and the corresponding arrival rate may depend on blockchain history data represented by a long-range dependent stochastic process. The optimality of the computed dynamic policy on maximizing the expected infinite-horizon discounted profit is proved concerning both demand and supply rate controls with dynamic pricing and sequential packaging scheduling in an integrated fashion. Our policy is a pathwise oriented one and can be easily implemented online. The effectiveness of our optimal policy is supported by simulation comparisons.	optimal policy computing;ai algorithm;smart contract;blockchain;federated learning;evolving convolution neural net;assemble-to-order (ato) production;metaverse;non-fungible token (nft)spectra

The main one is that it has facilitated the rise of digital currencies over the past several years and many other uses of non-crypto currency. There is a belief that the technology itself could far exceed cryptocurrencies by its impact. Thus, researchers are still discovering the real potential of blockchain. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive blockchain analysis with a bibliometric study. The data was retrieved from the Scopus database and was analyzed using the VOSviewer software, developed at Leiden University's Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), Leiden University, the Netherlands. The study is based on the analysis of 1842 documents published in the 2007-2021 period using Scopus. From the visualization, three main groups of six clusters are generated. The red area includes topics related to blockchain technology, supply chain management, and sustainable development. The green cluster stands for such keywords as blockchains, smart contracts, electronic money, and Bitcoin and Ethereum. The blue cluster area focuses on issues related to artificial intelligence, big data, health care, and COVID-19. The analysis helps to improve the quality of the review by directing researchers to the most significant documents and mapping areas of publications.	blockchain technology;bibliometric;scopus;vosviewerchallenges;security;internet
1123	协同技术	ExCrowd: A Blockchain Framework for Exploration-Based Crowdsourcing	Because of the rise of cryptocurrencies and decentralized apps, blockchain technology has generated a lot of interest. Among these is the emergent blockchain-based crowdsourcing paradigm, which eliminates the centralized conventional mechanism servers in favor of smart contracts for task and reward allocation. However, there are a few crucial challenges that must be resolved properly. For starters, most reputation-based systems favor high-performing employees. Secondly, the crowdsourcing platform's expensive service charges may obstruct the growth of crowdsourcing. Finally, unequal evaluation and reward allocation might lead to job dissatisfaction. As a result, the aforementioned issues will substantially impede the development of blockchain-based crowdsourcing systems. In this study, we introduce ExCrowd, a blockchain-based crowdsourcing system that employs a smart contract as a trustworthy authority to properly select workers, assess inputs, and award incentives while maintaining user privacy. Exploration-based crowdsourcing employs the hyperbolic learning curve model based on the conduct of workers and analyzes worker performance patterns using a decision tree technique. We specifically present the architecture of our framework, on which we establish a concrete scheme. Using a real-world dataset, we implement our model on the Ethereum public test network leveraging its reliability, adaptability, scalability, and rich statefulness. The results of our experiments demonstrate the efficiency, usefulness, and adaptability of our proposed system.	crowdsourcing;blockchain;decentralized;smart contractprivacy
1124	虚拟经济	Towards understanding governance tokens in liquidity mining: a case study of decentralized exchanges	The boom of liquidity mining has attracted enormous attention, which has brought tens of times increment in total value locked (TVL) to decentralized finance (DeFi) community. Meanwhile, governance tokens, as part of the liquidity mining reward, have been adopted by most decentralized applications (DApps) to attract users. However, the effectiveness of this method has not been proven in detail. In this paper, we choose one of the most representative cases where SushiSwap absorbed a significant amount of Uniswap liquidity in no time by forking Uniswap's code and issuing the governance token ahead to understand the governance tokens in liquidity mining. Specifically, we collect transaction records of Uniswap and SushiSwap for over a year and perform a detailed analysis of liquidity providers' (LPs) activities. Moreover, we design a scalable unsupervised clustering method, which uses metrics between transaction flows to build a similarity graph that can capture patterns between LPs with similar behaviour. These LPs range from inactive and cautious LPs, providing tiny liquidity to risk-seeking LPs, focusing on short time-intervals. On this basis, we discuss how the governance token affects liquidity mining, and use its impact on behaviours and decision-making to explain its attractiveness to users.	decentralized finance;liquidity mining;governance token;automatic market maker-based decentralized exchanges
1125	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Decentralized Cloud Solutions for Data Transfer	Cloud computing has increased its service area and user experience above traditional platforms through virtualization and resource integration, resulting in substantial economic and societal advantages. Cloud computing is experiencing a significant security and trust dilemma, requiring a trust-enabled transaction environment. The typical cloud trust model is centralized, resulting in high maintenance costs, network congestion, and even single-point failure. Also, due to a lack of openness and traceability, trust rating findings are not universally acknowledged. "Blockchain is a novel, decentralised computing system. Its unique operational principles and record traceability assure the transaction data's integrity, undeniability, and security. So, blockchain is ideal for building a distributed and decentralised trust infrastructure. This study addresses the difficulty of transferring data and related permission policies from the cloud to the distributed file systems (DFS). Our aims include moving the data files from the cloud to the distributed file system and developing a cloud policy. This study addresses the difficulty of transferring data and related permission policies from the cloud to the DFS. In DFS, no node is given the privilege, and storage of all the data is dependent on content-addressing. The data files are moved from Amazon S3 buckets to the interplanetary file system (IPFS). In DFS, no node is given the privilege, and storage of all the data is dependent on content-addressing.	storage
1126	协同技术	A Blockchain-Integrated Divided-Block Sparse Matrix Transformation Differential Privacy Data Publishing Model	With the rapid development of information technology, people benefit more and more from big data. At the same time, it becomes a great concern that how to obtain optimal outputs from big data publishing and sharing management while protecting privacy. Many researchers seek to realize differential privacy protection in massive high-dimensional datasets using the method of principal component analysis. However, these algorithms are inefficient in processing and do not take into account the different privacy protection needs of each attribute in high-dimensional datasets. To address the above problem, we design a Divided-block Sparse Matrix Transformation Differential Privacy Data Publishing Algorithm (DSMT-DP). In this algorithm, different levels of privacy budget parameters are assigned to different attributes according to the required privacy protection level of each attribute, taking into account the privacy protection needs of different levels of attributes. Meanwhile, the use of the divided-block scheme and the sparse matrix transformation scheme can improve the computational efficiency of the principal component analysis method for handling large amounts of high-dimensional sensitive data, and we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm satisfies differential privacy. Our experimental results show that the mean square error of the proposed algorithm is smaller than the traditional differential privacy algorithm with the same privacy parameters, and the computational efficiency can be improved. Further, we combine this algorithm with blockchain and propose an Efficient Privacy Data Publishing and Sharing Model based on the blockchain. Publishing and sharing private data on this model not only resist strong background knowledge attacks from adversaries outside the system but also prevent stealing and tampering of data by not-completely-honest participants inside the system.	
1127	实体经济	Towards Secure and Intelligent Internet of Health Things: A Survey of Enabling Technologies and Applications	With the growth of computing and communication technologies, the information processing paradigm of the healthcare environment is evolving. The patient information is stored electronically, making it convenient to store and retrieve patient information remotely when needed. However, evolving the healthcare systems into smart healthcare environments comes with challenges and additional pressures. Internet of Things (IoT) connects things, such as computing devices, through wired or wireless mediums to form a network. There are numerous security vulnerabilities and risks in the existing IoT-based systems due to the lack of intrinsic security technologies. For example, patient medical data, data privacy, data sharing, and convenience are considered imperative for collecting and storing electronic health records (EHR). However, the traditional IoT-based EHR systems cannot deal with these paradigms because of inconsistent security policies and data access structures. Blockchain (BC) technology is a decentralized and distributed ledger that comes in handy in storing patient data and encountering data integrity and confidentiality challenges. Therefore, it is a viable solution for addressing existing IoT data security and privacy challenges. BC paves a tremendous path to revolutionize traditional IoT systems by enhancing data security, privacy, and transparency. The scientific community has shown a variety of healthcare applications based on artificial intelligence (AI) that improve health diagnosis and monitoring practices. Moreover, technology companies and startups are revolutionizing healthcare with AI and related technologies. This study illustrates the implication of integrated technologies based on BC, IoT, and AI to meet growing healthcare challenges. This research study examines the integration of BC technology with IoT and analyzes the advancements of these innovative paradigms in the healthcare sector. In addition, our research study presents a detailed survey on enabling technologies for the futuristic, intelligent, and secure internet of health things (IoHT). Furthermore, this study comprehensively studies the peculiarities of the IoHT environment and the security, performance, and progression of the enabling technologies. First, the research gaps are identified by mapping security and performance benefits inferred by the BC technologies. Secondly, practical issues related to the integration process of BC and IoT devices are discussed. Third, the healthcare applications integrating IoT, BC, and ML in healthcare environments are discussed. Finally, the research gaps, future directions, and limitations of the enabling technologies are discussed.	blockchain;iot;healthcare;machine learning;ioht;convergencebig data;care applications;consortium blockchain;predictive analytics;management system;iot security;smart health;challenges;cloud;machine

Traditional medical insurance settlement is paid on a per-service basis, which leads to lots of unreasonable expenses. To cope with this problem, the single-disease payment mechanism has been widely used in recent years. However, the single-disease payment also has a risk of fraud. In this work, we propose a framework to identify fraud of medical insurance based on consortium blockchain and deep learning, which can recognize suspicious medical records automatically to ensure valid implementation on single-disease payment and lighten the work of medical insurance auditors. An explainable model BERT-LE is designed to evaluate the reasonability of ICD disease code for Medicare reimbursement by predicting the probability of a disease according to the chief complaint of a patient. We also put forward a storage and management process of medical records based on consortium blockchain to ensure the security, immutability, traceability, and auditability of the data. The experiments on two real datasets from two 3A hospitals demonstrate that the proposed solution can identify fraud effectively and greatly improve the efficiency in medical insurance reviews.

1129	实体经济	PPSEB: A Postquantum Public-Key Searchable Encryption Scheme on Blockchain for E-Healthcare Scenarios	In the current E-healthcare scenarios, medical institutions are used to encrypt the information and store it in an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system in order to ensure the privacy of medical information. To realize data sharing, a Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) scheme is indispensable, ensuring doctors search for medical information in the state of ciphertext. However, the traditional PEKS scheme cannot resist the keyword guessing quantum computing attacks, and its security depends on the confidentiality of the secret key. In addition, classical PEKS hand over the search process to a third party, affecting the search results' accuracy. Therefore, we proposed a postquantum Public-key Searchable Encryption scheme on Blockchain (PPSEB) for E-healthcare scenarios. Firstly, we utilized a lattice-based cryptographic primitive to ensure the security of the search process and achieve forward security to avoid key leakage of medical information. Secondly, we introduced blockchain technology to solve the problem of third-party untrustworthiness in the search process. Finally, through security analysis, we prove the correctness and forward security of the solution in the E-healthcare scenarios, and the comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of our scheme compared with other existing schemes.	system
1130	实体经济	CKMIB: Construction of Key Agreement Protocol for Cloud Medical Infrastructure Using Blockchain	In the traditional medical healthcare system, each medical facility is responsible for preserving its own records. Sharing such records with another medical establishment is difficult for them. To tackle this challenge, the traditional medical system leverages internet technology to transform into a modern electronic system. In electronic healthcare systems, managing the security and privacy of patient data becomes a major issue. As an alternative, the healthcare sector might use blockchain technology to exchange digitised healthcare data. Blockchain technology is characterised by anonymity, decentralisation, and immutability. It is hard to keep all electronic healthcare data on blockchain due to the expense and volume. Cloud computing is the best solution for storing this type of data and resolving problems like these. To address these concerns, we offer a blockchain-based key agreement protocol for cloud medical network systems that enhances privacy and security. We demonstrate a formal and informal security analysis of the proposed protocol that shows that the proposed protocol is both secure and communicative. We provide security verification of the proposed protocol by using the AVISPA software tool against man in the middle attack and replay attack. Finally, we compute the computation and communication costs of the proposed protocol and other existing protocols, the proposed protocol has less computation and communication costs than other existing protocols in the electronic healthcare system.	blockchains;authentication;cloud computing;protocols;security;electronic healthcare;servers;elliptic curve cryptography;blockchain;mutual authentication;medical data;security and privacyauthentication protocol;security

However, using a blockchain-based ACTS requires additional expenditures from chain members. Chain members want to know the investment conditions of a blockchain-based ACTS and how to coordinate their supply chain. To solve these problems, a supply chain with one fresh producer and one retailer was chosen as the study subject. Afterwards, considering the unreliability of the freshness information, the demand function was revised. Then, the profit functions before and after adopting a blockchain-based ACTS were constructed, and then a price discount and revenue-sharing contract was put forward to coordinate the supply chain. Findings: With the growth of the unreliability coefficient of the freshness information, benefits to chain members in the proposed three situations would be reduced. Thus, we can know that after using a blockchain-based ACTS, if chain members want to gain more benefits, they should try their best to excavate the value of the blockchain-based ACTS and reduce the unreliability coefficient of the freshness information.	blockchain;anti-counterfeiting traceability;fresh supply chain;investment decision;coordinationmanagement;optimization;technology;system
1132	实体经济	Blockchain Development Services Provider Assessment Model for a Logistics Organizations	As the global market develops along with technological advances, especially the opening of markets in developing and underdeveloped countries, the logistics industry is considered by managers to be a useful tool to link different functions of corporate strategy. Logistics is the process of planning, implementing and controlling the movement of goods or information that are related to raw materials (inputs) and final products (outputs) from the point of origin to the point of consumption in order to meet customer requirements. The logistics industry brings about many positive effects, not only for the national economy but also for creating equal business opportunities for businesses of all economic sectors. However, large companies in the logistics industry still depend on EDI or APIS to exchange secure authentication data, which increase the security of operations within the industry, but this is the cause of a lot of confusion with serious consequences on the supply chain when it is too dependent on these systems. To minimize the risks and optimize the problems mentioned above, blockchain technology could help the logistics industry to operate optimally. In an era when everything is digitized, from personal information to financial transactions, choosing a system with high reliability and security becomes extremely important. Currently, there are many blockchain development services providers and it is essential to choose the investment in this technology that suits the characteristics and purposes of the logistics organization in question. This study aimed to propose a two-stage fuzzy multicriteria decision-making model for the assessment of blockchain development services providers for logistics organizations. The hybrid MCDM model was evaluated through a real-world case study at a logistics organization. The contribution of this work is the provision of useful guidelines for the evaluation and selection of blockchain technology services providers for logistics companies.	blockchain technology;mcdm model;fuzzy theory;logisticssupplier selection

Thus, a new data perception and privacy protection model based on mobile group intelligence perception and cloud computing is required. The existing work on data security and privacy protection mainly focuses on the independent link of data collection, aggregation, and services, which lacks holistic consideration for the different service requirements. To end this issue, this article comprehensively integrates the security and privacy protection requirements of various stages in the mobile group intelligence perception for data collection, aggregation, and service from a global perspective. Aiming at data privacy and security issues in the existing mobile group intelligence perception system, and the difficulty in guaranteeing the quantity and quality of data at the same time, a mobile group intelligence perception mechanism oriented to user privacy and data security is proposed. This mechanism uses deep learning as its core algorithm to handle big data cases. It can provide authenticity and reliability guarantees for the subsequent data application on the premise of protecting user privacy. Experimental results prove that the mechanism proposed in this article meets the security requirements, and its user-end computing overhead is small.	deep learning;data privacy;cloud computing;data security;smart contracts;blockchains;internet of things
1135	协同技术	Wind Driven Optimization-Based Medical Image Encryption for Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Things Environment	Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain receive significant interest owing to their applicability in different application areas such as healthcare, finance, transportation, etc. Medical image security and privacy become a critical part of the healthcare sector where digital images and related patient details are communicated over the public networks. This paper presents a new wind driven optimization algorithm based medical image encryption (WDOA-MIE) technique for blockchain enabled IoT environments. The WDOA-MIE model involves three major processes namely data collection, image encryption, optimal key generation, and data transmission. Initially, the medical images were captured from the patient using IoT devices. Then, the captured images are encrypted using signcryption technique. In addition, for improving the performance of the signcryption technique, the optimal key generation procedure was applied by WDOA algorithm. The goal of the WDOA-MIE algorithm is to derive a fitness function dependent upon peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR). Upon successful encryption of images, the IoT devices transmit to the closest server for storing it in the blockchain securely. The performance of the presented method was analyzed utilizing the benchmark medical image dataset. The security and the performance analysis determine that the presented technique offers better security with maximum PSNR of 60.7036 dB.	internet of things;image security;medical images;encryption;optimal key generation;blockchainalgorithm;security
1136	核心技术	DONS: Dynamic Optimized Neighbor Selection for smart blockchain networks	Blockchain (BC) systems mainly depend on the consistent state of the Distributed Ledger (DL) at different logical and physical places of the network. The majority of network nodes need to be enforced to use one or both of the following approaches to remain consistent: (i) to wait for certain delays (i.e. by requesting a hard puzzle solution as in PoW and PoUW, or to wait for random delays as in PoET, etc.) (ii) to propagate shared data through shortest possible paths within the network. The first approach may cause higher energy consumption and/or lower throughput rates if not optimized, and in many cases these features are conventionally fixed. Therefore, it is preferred to enhance the second approach with some optimization. Previous works for this approach have the following drawbacks: they may violate the identity privacy of miners, only locally optimize the Neighbor Selection method (NS), do not consider the dynamicity of the network, or require the nodes to know the precise size of the network at all times. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a Dynamic and Optimized NS protocol called DONS, using a novel privacy-aware leader election within the public BC called AnoLE, where the leader anonymously solves the The Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) of the network in polynomial time. Consequently, miners are informed about the optimum NS according to the current state of network topology. We analytically evaluate the complexity, the security and the privacy of the proposed protocols against state-of-the-art MST solutions for DLs and well known attacks. Additionally, we experimentally show that the proposed protocols outperform state-of-the-art NS solutions for public BCs. Our evaluation shows that the proposed DONS and AnoLE protocols are secure, private, and they acutely outperform all current NS solutions in terms of block finality and fidelity.

1137	实体经济	Joint Optimization of Edge Computing Resource Pricing and Wireless Caching for Blockchain-Driven Networks	In wireless communication networks, traffics of base stations (BS) can be effectively offloaded by sharing the cached content between mobile devices through wireless device-to-device (D2D) communication. To encourage the content caching of D2D users, a blockchain incentive scheme is proposed; the game theory is introduced to optimize the benefits for both the edge computing server (ECS) and D2D users in the blockchain network. In Stackelberg game, D2D users act as followers. After the successful implementation of the cache strategy, D2D users are rewarded by the system, which is a new block mining process. In this process, the required computing power is provided by the ECS. Therefore, D2D cache users need to pay the cost to purchase computing power from the ECS. As the game leader, the ECS prices the computing resources, and D2D users adjust their caching strategies based on the price. In this paper, we propose four algorithms based on different pricing methods and different cache reward methods. Simulations are performed to compare the cache quality and cache content dispersion of the four algorithms. The results show that the uniform pricing scheme with a linear reward relationship is more suitable for the scenarios that require higher cache quality, and the discriminatory pricing scheme with a nonlinear reward relationship is more suitable for the scenarios that require more evenly cache content distribution.	device-to-device communication;pricing;games;blockchains;wireless communication;mobile handsets;edge computing;resource allocation;d2d communications;blockchain;cache strategy;stackelberg game;pricinggame;allocation;placement
1138	实体经济	Fine-grained and fair identity authentication scheme for mobile networks based on blockchain	With the popularity of the internet, users hope to better protect their privacy while obtaining network services. However, in the traditional centralized authentication scheme, identity information such as the user's private key is generated, stored, and managed by the network operator. Users can't control their identity information, which will lead to a great threat to the privacy of users. Based on redactable blockchain, we propose a fine-grained and fair identity authentication scheme for mobile networks. In our proposed scheme, the user's identity information is generated and controlled by the users. We first propose a notion of score chameleon hash (SCH), which can delete or update the information of illegal users so as to dynamically update the status of users and provide users with more fine-grained and fair services. We propose another notion of self-updating secret sharing (SUSS), which allows users to update the trapdoor and the corresponding hash key after redacting the blockchain without requiring trusted authority to redistribute the trapdoor. Experimental results show that, compared with the immutable blockchain Bit-coin, the redactable blockchain in our identity authentication scheme provides users with fine-grained and fair redacting functions, and can be adopted with a small additional overhead.	blockchains;authentication;security;privacy;public key;systems architecture;registers;identity authentication;secret sharing;chameleon hash;redactable blockchainprivacy

Comparing the cryptocurrency bubble periods with the COVID-19 pandemic, the results indicate that this pandemic has the highest impact on cryptocurrency market efficiency. Interestingly, using the dynamic time warping clustering approach, we found evidence on the presence of three clusters that essentially represent mining coins, non-mining coins and token categorizations .	covid-19 pandemic;cryptocurrency bubbles;mining and non-mining coins;tokens;dynamic market efficiency;dynamic time warping and clustering

We implement the time-varying symmetrized Joe-Clayton copula GARCH model and Bai-Perron breakpoint test to explore dynamic correlations between the daily log-returns of the two markets in each time range. The asymmetric contagion effects between the two markets are studied using the non-linear Granger causality test. We also find that the lower tail dependences are more significant than the upper ones. Our findings can be used as a reference for supervisory authorities, and also provide insights on risk hedging for rational investors to avoid underestimating risk when building their portfolios.	asymmetric contagion effect;cryptocurrency market;stock market;time-varying sjc-copula-garch model;nonlinear granger causality testgranger causality
1142	实体经济	Secure and Anonymous Voting D-App with IoT Embedded Device Using Blockchain Technology	The paper presents the construction of a proof-of-concept for a distributed and decentralized e-voting application in an IoT embedded device with the help of blockchain technology. A SoC board was used as an IoT embedded device for testing the PoC. This solution ensures complete voter anonymity and end-to-end security for all entities participating in the electronic voting process. The paper outlines the solution's two layers. Implementation details are presented for the e-voting application, which was deployed inside of an IoT embedded device. The solution and presented protocols provide two major properties: privacy and verifiability. To ensure privacy, the proposed solution protects the secrecy of each electronic vote. As for implementing verifiability, the solution prevents a corrupt authority from faking in any way the process of counting the votes. Both properties are achieved in the presented solution e-VoteD-App.	blockchain;e-voted-app;decentralized application;iot-internet of things;cyber security;mobile-embedded;secure elementinternet
1143	实体经济	Blockchain Adoption to Secure the Food Industry: Opportunities and Challenges	With the growth in food products' usage, ensuring their quality and safety has become progressively difficult. Specifically, food traceability turns out to be a very critical task for retailers, sellers, consumers, surveillance authorities, and other stakeholders in the food supply chain system. There are requirements for food authenticity verification (correct declaration of cultivation, origin, and variety), quality checks (e.g., justification for higher prices), and preventing food products from fraudsters in the food industry. The ubiquitous and promising technology of blockchain ensures the traceability of food trade networks with high potential and handles the aforementioned issues. Blockchain makes the food industry more transparent at all levels by storing data immutably and enabling quick tracking across the stages of the food supply chain. Hence, commodities, stakeholders, and semi-finished food items can be recognized significantly faster. Motivated by these facts, in this paper, we present an in-depth survey of state-of-the-art approaches to the food industry's security, food traceability, and food supply chain management. Further, we propose a blockchain-based secure and decentralized food industry architecture to alleviate security and privacy aspects and present a comprehensive solution taxonomy for a blockchain-based food industry. Then, a comparative analysis of existing approaches with respect to various parameters, i.e., scalability, latency, and food quality, is presented, which facilitates the end-user in selecting approaches based on the merits over other approaches. Finally, we provide insights into the open issues and research challenges with concluding remarks.	blockchain;food industry;food supply chain;traceability;food data securitytraceability;technology;management
1144	实体经济	Fully Decentralized, Cost-Effective Energy Demand Response Management System with a Smart Contracts-Based Optimal Power Flow Solution for Smart Grids	Recent advances in control, communication, and management systems, as well as the widespread use of renewable energy sources in homes, have led to the evolution of traditional power grids into smart grids, where passive consumers have become so-called prosumers that feed energy into the grid. On the other hand, the integration of blockchain into the smart grid has enabled the emergence of decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading, where prosumers trade their energy as tokenized assets. Even though this new paradigm benefits both distribution grid operators and end users in many ways. Nevertheless, there is a conflict of interest between the two parties, as on the one hand, prosumers want to maximize their profit, while on the other hand, distribution system operators (DSOs) seek an optimal power flow (OPF) operating point. Due to the complexity of formulating and solving OPF problems in the presence of renewable energy sources, researchers have focused on mathematical modeling and effective solution algorithms for such optimization problems. However, the control of power generation according to a defined OPF solution is still based on centralized control and management units owned by the DSO. In this paper, we propose a novel, fully decentralized architecture for an OPF-based demand response management system that uses smart contracts to force generators to comply without the need for a central authority or hardware.	decentralized;blockchain;optimal power flow;smart grid;smart contractschallenges
1145	实体经济	Automatic Demand Response Method for the Energy Storage Resource System Based on the Blockchain Technology Combined with Sensors	In order to improve the efficiency of the automatic demand response of the energy storage resource system, a user authentication and key agreement scheme for wireless sensor networks based on blockchain is proposed. The user does not need to register with the gateway node. As the light node of the blockchain network, the two can directly authenticate each other. The user obtains the public information of the sensor node from the blockchain through the client and verifies its legitimacy. It solves the problem that the traditional wireless sensor network user authentication scheme cannot be applied to the distributed Internet of things environment and the authentication process is low in security and efficiency. Mode 1 is the disordered charging mode. The charging facility provides continuous constant power charging service for the connected response subject until the user leaves. If the response subject is full before this, the charging will stop. Mode 2 is the BADR operation mode under charging optimization only, that is, the V2G function of PEV is not considered. In this case, 0 < P-l,P-k <= P-l(max c). Mode 3 is the BADR operating mode with V2G functionality in mind. The ELN load characteristics under the above three operating modes are discussed, respectively. Calculate and compare with economy on both sides of supply and demand. The experimental results show that the discharge compensation coefficient will not affect mode 2. In mode 3, as the compensation coefficient increases (from 0.4 to 1.2 at intervals of 0.2), the average total cost of the PEV cluster continues to decrease and the average total cost of the energy local network (ELN) system increases monotonically. Comparing the curves of the economic impact of the compensation coefficient on both sides of mode 2 and mode 3, it can be seen that the reasonable setting of the compensation coefficient is one of the key parameters for controlling the distribution of benefits. It proves that the proposed blockchain-based automated demand response (BADR) method can not only meet the satisfaction of energy demand but also coordinate the available energy storage resources in the system, so that the load level curve can track the output of new energy to the greatest extent and improve the balance between supply and demand of the system, which is suitable for a large-scale decentralized energy storage system.	
1146	实体经济	A Regulatable Data Privacy Protection Scheme for Energy Transactions Based on Consortium Blockchain	In the blockchain-based energy transaction scenario, the decentralization and transparency of the ledger will cause the users' transaction details to be disclosed to all participants. Attackers can use data mining algorithms to obtain and analyze users' private data, which will lead to the disclosure of transaction information. Simultaneously, it is also necessary for regulatory authorities to implement effective supervision of private data. Therefore, we propose a supervisable energy transaction data privacy protection scheme, which aims to trade off the supervision of energy transaction data by the supervisory authority and the privacy protection of transaction data. First, the concealment of the transaction amount is realized by Pedersen commitment and Bulletproof range proof. Next, the combination of ElGamal encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology ensures the authenticity of audit tickets, which allows regulators to achieve reliable supervision of the transaction privacy data without opening the commitment. Finally, the multibase decomposition method is used to improve the decryption efficiency of the supervisor. Experiments and security analysis show that the scheme can well satisfy transaction privacy and auditability.

We also estimate the optimal weights, hedge ratios, and hedging effectiveness for all pairs of markets. Our results suggest that the COVID-19 crisis intensified the spillover effect between the selected Islamic assets. We show that investors could increase their allocations in Onegram gold-backed cryptocurrency to reduce the risk of the equity sector portfolio during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the hedging costs for all pairs have increased during the COVID-19 period in comparison to the pre-pandemic level. Finally, the analysis of hedging effectiveness suggests that investors can reduce the risk of Islamic sectorial equity portfolios by adding the Islamic Sharia-based cryptocurrencies during both sample periods.	spillovers;stablecoins;islamic cryptocurrencies;gold-backed cryptocurrencies;islamic equity sectors;covid-19;hedging effectivenessdynamic conditional correlation;volatility transmission;stock indexes;crude-oil;time;hedge;connectedness;securities;energy
1148	实体经济	Trustworthy Digital Twins in the Industrial Internet of Things With Blockchain	Industrial processes rely on sensory data for critical decision-making processes. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the trustworthiness of data. To this end, we envision a blockchain-based framework for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to address the issues of data management and security. Once the data collected from trustworthy sources are recorded in the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, we leverage digital twins (DTs) that can draw intelligent conclusions from the data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of DTs and blockchain to target key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and fault diagnosis. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges faced by the IIoT and future research directions while leveraging blockchain and DTs.	industrial internet of things;blockchain;distributed databases;data models;industries;monitoring;digital twin;digital twins (dts);blockchain;industrial internet of things (iiot);sensors;data security and trustsecurity
1149	实体经济	A survey on blockchain-based Recommender Systems: Integration architecture and taxonomy	A Recommender System (RS) is an integral part of present-day leading web services, such as YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, and many others. Modern RSs are challenged to go beyond their traditional role of predicting user preferences to efficiently provide reliable, carefully personalized, and highly accurate recommendations. This paper thoroughly explores and analyzes state-of-the-art literature surveys on RS to extract important challenges and open issues. Our goal in this paper is to survey the literature to extract essential features of RSs and Blockchain (BC), focusing on their integration. Because of the lack of an existing foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed. This paper also includes a thorough discussion on the validity of the proposed architecture, BC limitations concerning RSs, and the derivation of a rich set of pointers to future research directions.	recommender systems;blockchain;smart contracts;oracles;distributed ledgers;securitysupply chain

If social media information is correctly explored, there will be significant support for investigating various offenses. Exploring social media information to give the government potential proof of a crime is not an easy task. Digital forensic investigation is based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and the blockchain framework proposed in this process. The main reason for using NLP in this process is for data collection analysis, representations of every phase, vectorization phase, feature selection, and classifier evaluation. Applying a blockchain technique in this system secures the data information to avoid hacking and any network attack.

1151	协同技术	Resource Allocation on Blockchain Enabled Mobile Edge Computing System	Currently, the concept of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been applied as a solution against the plethora of demands for high-quality computing services. It comprises several essential processes, such as resource allocation, data transmission, and task processing. Furthermore, researchers applied blockchain technology, aiming to enhance the robustness of the MEC system. At present, resource allocation in the MEC system is a very hot field, but there are still some problems in the resource allocation process under the traditional MEC architecture, such as privacy disclosure and so on. Moreover, the resource allocation problem in a blockchain-enabled MEC system will be more complicated, while the mining process may have an impact on resource allocation policy. To address this issue, this paper investigates the resource allocation problem with blockchain-based MEC system architecture. A brand new consensus mechanism: proof of learning (PoL), is applied to the system, which does not waste the computing resources of edge computing servers. Based on this, we modeled the system mathematically, focusing on server processing latency, mining latency, rewards under the new consensus, and total cost. The asynchronous advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm is used to optimize resource allocation policy. To better capture the long-time trend of the system, the temporal convolutional network (TCN) is implemented to represent the policy function and state-value function in the reinforcement learning model. The results show that the A3C algorithm based on TCN not only converges faster but also is more stable.	mobile edge computing;blockchain;proof of learning;resource allocation;asynchronous advantage actor-critic;temporal convolutional networkalgorithm;internet
1152	协同技术	Strategy for dynamic blockchain construction and transmission in novel edge computing networks	The distributed transmission of a dynamic blockchain in a cloud computing platform may cause network overload. To overcome this challenge, a novel idea for a network architecture that is suitable for blockchain transmission and storage is proposed. Emerging edge computing technology has been proven to improve the efficiency of blockchain construction and operation. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of unbalanced resource allocation for blockchain construction and transmission in a novel edge computing network architecture. We propose the edge bandwidth and storage optimization (EBSO) algorithm to balance effective bandwidth allocation and storage space selection during dynamic blockchain processing. In addition, we build a dynamic blockchain based on a link bandwidth allocation analysis in an edge computing network environment. Subsequently, the reasonable value range of the tradeoff parameter gamma between the link bandwidth and storage space during the transmission of the constructed dynamic blockchain is determined. Finally, we use version 2 of the network simulator (ns-2) to simulate the performance of the EBSO algorithm and compare it with other excellent algorithms in terms of transmission bandwidth efficiency (TBE), storage space efficiency (SSE), blockchain construction efficiency (BCE), average throughput, and average delay in the same network environment.

1153	协同技术	5G-BSS: 5G-Based Universal Blockchain Smart Sensors	A smart sensor is a sensor with information processing functions. It is the product of the combination of sensor integration and a microprocessor. It has the characteristics of intelligence, networking and high precision. It has been widely used in aerospace, aviation, intelligent transportation, industrial control and medical and health care. However, in some specific application scenarios with high data security requirements and low transmission delay, such as environmental detection, transportation, etc., smart sensors have three obvious shortcomings. First, the data transmission delay is high. Second, the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmission process cannot be effectively guaranteed. Third, centralized data storage is easily leaked and tampered with by malicious users and semi-trusted administrators. Therefore, a 5G-based blockchain smart sensor 5G-BSS was designed. 5G-BSS has three innovation points. First, the 5G communication module enables the smart sensor 5G-BSS. The 5G communication module is integrated into the smart sensor 5G-BSS to reduce the delay of data transmission and improve the speed and reliability of data transmission. Second, cryptographic algorithms enable the smart sensor 5G-BSS. The data encryption module of the smart sensor 5G-BSS improves the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmission process. Third, blockchain empowers the smart sensor 5G-BSS. The blockchain client is integrated into the smart sensor 5G-BSS to ensure the centralized storage of data and prevent data leakage and tampering by semi-trusted administrators. The operation process of the hardware and software architecture is described in detail and tested on the Fisco-Bcos. The experimental results show that 5G-BSS not only has fast data transmission speed but also can effectively guarantee the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data. 5G-BSS is suitable for application scenarios with high requirements for data security and data transmission, such as environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving, etc.	smart sensor;blockchain;5g communication;distributed storage system
1154	实体经济	Design and Application of Electronic Rehabilitation Medical Record (ERMR) Sharing Scheme Based on Blockchain Technology	As the value of blockchain has been widely recognized, more and more industries are proposing their blockchain solutions, including the rehabilitation medical industry. Blockchain can play a powerful role in the field of rehabilitation medicine, bringing a new research idea to the management of rehabilitation medical data. The electronic rehabilitation medical record (ERMR) contains rich data dimensions, which can provide comprehensive and accurate information for assessing the health of patients, thereby enhancing the effect of rehabilitation treatment. This paper analyzed the data characteristics of ERMR and the application requirements of blockchain in rehabilitation medicine. Based on the basic principles of blockchain, the technical advantages of blockchain used in ERMR sharing have been studied. In addition, this paper designed a blockchain-based ERMR sharing scheme in detail, using the specific technologies of blockchain such as hybrid P2P network, block-chain data structure, asymmetric encryption algorithm, digital signature, and Raft consensus algorithm to achieve distributed storage, data security, privacy protection, data consistency, data traceability, and data ownership in the process of ERMR sharing. The research results of this paper have important practical significance for realizing the safe and efficient sharing of ERMR, and can provide important technical references for the management of rehabilitation medical data with broad application prospects	
1155	实体经济	BFS: A blockchain-based financing scheme for logistics company in supply chain finance	Against the backdrop of the booming supply chain finance and logistics industry, Logistics 4.0 has emerged. However, the financing capacity of today's logistics companies is still unable to respond to the needs of the rapid development of the supply chain. On the one hand, the problem of logistics companies' lack of existing high-value collateral in supply chain finance has led to a clutter of their credit data and difficulty in verifying their creditworthiness. On the other hand, the massive access to logistics companies' business information can also lead to privacy leaks. At the same time, the transparency feature of blockchain is used to solve the financing dilemma of many industries in supply chain finance. On this basis, we propose a blockchain-based financing scheme (BFS) for logistics company. BFS utilises more efficient and interpretative smart contract technology, as well as improved privacy information query and invocation algorithms, to realise automatic control of entity node privacy information flow and significantly simplifying the steps and lowering the thresholds to financing for logistics companies, while protecting the privacy of their data. After extensive simulation testing, BFS can run supply chain blocks at a stable transaction throughput of around 280 RPS, with data transfers that meet the financing needs of logistics companies, providing a higher and more stable performance than the native Hyperledger Fabric.	blockchain;supply chain finance;hyperledger fabric
1156	实体经济	Blockchain-enabled wireless communications: a new paradigm towards 6G	With the deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks worldwide, research on sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications has commenced. It is expected that 6G networks can accommodate numerous heterogeneous devices and infrastructures with enhanced efficiency and security over diverse, e.g. spectrum, computing and storage, resources. However, this goal is impeded by a number of trust-related issues that are often neglected in network designs. Blockchain, as an innovative and revolutionary technology that has arisen in the recent decade, provides a promising solution. Building on its nature of decentralization, transparency, anonymity, immutability, traceability and resiliency, blockchain can establish cooperative trust among separate network entities and facilitate, e.g. efficient resource sharing, trusted data interaction, secure access control, privacy protection, and tracing, certification and supervision functionalities for wireless networks, thus presenting a new paradigm towards 6G. This paper is dedicated to blockchain-enabled wireless communication technologies. We first provide a brief introduction to the fundamentals of blockchain, and then we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the most recent efforts in incorporating blockchain into wireless communications from several aspects. Importantly, we further propose a unified framework of the blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) as a trustworthy and secure paradigm for 6G networking by utilizing blockchain technologies with enhanced efficiency and security. The critical elements of B-RAN, such as consensus mechanisms, smart contract, trustworthy access, mathematical modeling, cross-network sharing, data tracking and auditing and intelligent networking, are elaborated. We also provide the prototype design of B-RAN along with the latest experimental results. This work investigates state-of-the-art advances in incorporating blockchain into wireless communications and proposes blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) as a trustworthy and secure paradigm for the future 6G networking.	blockchain;wireless communication;6gcognitive-radio;resource-allocation;management;iot;traceability;framework;security;internet;trust;authentication
1157	市场治理	Multisource financial sentiment analysis for detecting Bitcoin price change indications using deep learning	The success of deep learning (DL) in various areas, such as computer vision, fueled the interest in several novel DL-enabled applications, such as financial trading, which could potentially surpass the previously used approaches. Indeed, there has been a plethora of DL-based trading methods proposed in recent years. Despite the success of these methods, they typically rely on a very restricted set of information, usually employing only price-related information. As a result, they ignore sentiment-related information, which can have a profound impact and be a strong predictor of various assets, such as cryptocurencies. The contribution of this paper is multifold. First, we examine whether the use of sentiment information, as extracted by various online sources, including news articles, is beneficial when training DL agents for trading. Then, given the difficulty of training reliable sentiment extractors for financial applications, we evaluate the impact of using different DL models as sentiment extractors, as well as employ an unsupervised training pipeline for further improving their performance. Finally, we propose an effective multisource sentiment fusion approach that can improve the performance over the rest of the evaluated approaches. The conducted experiments have been performed using several different configurations and models, ranging from multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to provide a reliable evaluation of sentiment-aware DL-based trading strategies providing evidence that sentiment information might be a stronger predictor compared to the information provided by the actual price time series for Bitcoin.	financial trading;sentiment analysis;deep learning;sentiment-aware tradingneural-networks

By applying the asymmetric multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we show that the outbreak affected the efficiency property of price behaviors differently between short- and long-term horizons. After the outbreak, the markets exhibited stronger multifractality in the short-term but weaker multifractality in the long-term. We also analyze asymmetric market patterns between upward and downward trends and between small and large price fluctuations and confirm that the outbreak has greatly changed the level of asymmetry in cryptocurrency markets.	cryptocurrency;covid-19;market efficiency;multi-scale property;generalized hurst exponent;a-mfdfaherding behavior;bitcoin;inefficiency;memory

Prior studies that have examined the predictability of cryptocurrencies using various economic risk factors have reported mixed results. Our out-of-sample evidence identifies the existence of a significant return predictability of cryptocurrencies based on the cryptocurrency market risk premium. Consistent with capital asset pricing theory (CAPM), our results show that investors often require higher positive returns before taking on any additional risks, particularly in terms of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Tests involving the CAPM model demonstrates that the three largest cryptocurrencies have significant exposures to the proposed market factor with insignificant intercepts, demonstrating that the market factor explains average cryptocurrency returns very well.	cryptocurrency;capm;crypto market risk premium;empirical asset pricingbitcoin;predictability;inefficiency;efficiency;liquidity;economics

Evidence from machine learning	As an emerging asset, cryptocurrencies have attracted more and more attention from investors and researchers in recent years. With the gradual convergence of the investors in cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets, the research on investor trading behavior from the perspective of microstructure has become increasingly important in cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we study whether investors' informed trading behavior can significantly predict cryptocurrency returns. We use various machine learning algorithms to verify the contribution of informed trading to the predictability of cryptocurrency returns. The results show that informed trading plays a role in the prediction of some individual cryptocurrency returns, but it cannot significantly improve the prediction accuracy in an average sense of the whole market. The lack of market supervision of cryptocurrency market may be the main factor for relatively low efficiency of this market, and policymakers need to pay attention to it.	cryptocurrency;machine learning;behavioral finance;informed trading;forecastingcross-section;stock returns;information;liquidity;bitcoin;probability;volatility

First, we find long memory, volatility clustering, heavy tails, and negative leverage effects to be common features of cryptocurrencies' return behavior. Second, GARCH models accounting for these features provide the best goodness-of-fit properties. About 80% of cryptocurrencies are well described by Student's t (stud) GARCH specifications with the TGARCH-stud chosen for about 20% of the sample. We then compare out-of-sample 1%-Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts under 48 specifications using standard backtesting procedures. Heavy-tailed VaR specifications outperform all normally distributed alternatives. Throughout the analysis, differences emerge when results are broken down by traded volume and usage categories. Overall, our findings have important implications for investors, policymakers, and regulators for the understanding and measuring of market risk in the cryptocurrency market.	cryptocurrency;volatility;garch;value-at-riskvolatility;returns;persistence;frequency;gold

This first-ever study of coherence between returns of NFTs and major assets employs the wavelet approach. The pairwise returns coherence between the considered markets grows throughout the Covid-19. Before the pandemic, NFTs lag behind stocks (2017) and bitcoin (2018), while lead gold (2018). We reveal that the returns coherence between NFTs and other assets is high/low for the two-week-plus/below-to-weeks investment horizons. We refine Aharon and Demir ' s (2021) findings stating that NFTs absorbed risk during Covid-19 by demonstrating that this conclusion holds only in the short-run for below-two-weeks horizons.	return connectedness;covid-19;non-fungible tokens;spillover
1163	实体经济	Decentralized Review and Attestation of Software Attribute Claims	Software can be described, like human users and other objects, through attributes. For this work, we define software attributes as humanly verifiable, falsifiable, or judgeable statements regarding characteristics of said software. Much like attributes in general, software attributes require robust identities for their source but also for their target, meaning a software in general or a binary in particular. As software can be of critical importance, performing an independent review of attribute claims appears beneficial. We posit that decentralized platforms that were developed and refined over the past decade can bridge the gap between existing tools and methods for software review and their open, transparent, and accountable use for the benefit of users. In this work, we explore the feasibility and implications of decentralizing an independent review of software attribute claims. We envision the decentralization of a review process from initialization and execution to the persistent recording of results. We sketch the available design space by decomposing the overall process into a modular design and describe how each component covers overarching objectives. To illustrate practical implications and tradeoffs, we present ETHDPR, a proof of concept implementation based on Ethereum and IPFS. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we show that a decentralized software review is practically feasible. We illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach using a toy example of a software component in automotive systems. Lastly, we provide a discussion on fundamental limits and open issues of facilitating independent reviews via technological means.	software;software reviews;censorship;stakeholders;certification;blockchains;task analysis;decentralized systems;software attributes;software certification;software identity management;software review;software transparency
1164	实体经济	Blockchain land transfers: Technology, promises, and perils	The blockchain's apparent immutability has attracted significant interest on whether it may be relied on for registering and transferring land. Proponents of blockchain-based land systems point toward data security, automated transacting, and improved accessibility as key benefits; critics raise concerns over structural vulnerabilities, such as majority attacks, and inconsistencies with existing legal frameworks. The literature, however, tends to conceptualise blockchain as one monolithic data structure invariably built on the same mechanisms powering Bitcoin. This paper seeks to situate the debate on a closer understanding of the range of blockchain implementations possible. To this end, we provide a detailed technological survey of established and emerging blockchain technologies, clarifying that different consensus mechanisms, permissioning schemes, and other use-based customisations, are possible. We then re-evaluate the promises and perils of blockchain land transfers in this light, focusing on the English conveyancing system, and illustrate how different implementations involve different advantages and limitations. However, the features necessary to avoid key vulnerabilities also diminish the marginal advantages of using blockchains over traditional electronic databases. Thus, we conclude that blockchains, even properly understood, remain unsuitable for land transfers. (C) 2022 Vincent Ooi, Soh Kian Peng, Jerrold Soh. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1166	实体经济	Chatbot for construction firms using scalable blockchain network	Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), including multimedia tools, email services, voice-based tools, and handheld computing tools, have been extensively used for automating and digitalizing different construction processes and activities. However, these technologies are subjected to single-point attacks or failures, manipulation, and lack of privacy and traceability. This study introduces a novel information exchange and management system for construction firms based on blockchain technology and chatbots. The system leverages the characteristics of blockchain technology in terms of peer-to-peer operation mode, data integrity, structuring, and privacy, and the chatbots' merits regarding ease of use and degree of automation. The system is developed for tracking work progress in construction projects as a generic use-case using a four-step approach. First, a private blockchain network is configured for data distribution and storage. Second, a smart contract is coded for regulating data writing/reading operations. Third, a chatbot is developed for data collection and retrieval through textual conversations. Fourth, serverless cloud function and cloudant database are configured to allow the linkage between the blockchain network and the chatbot. A prototype of the system is built and applied to a case study of non-residential construction project to test and verify its capabilities. Further, the system's performance is assessed in terms of the writing and reading latencies and the storage size. The system features can be extended by embedding mathematical algorithms to simultaneously analyze data and employing Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to maintain visuals and large-size data.	information management systems;blockchain network;chatbot;serverless computing;smart contractsreal-time;technology;progress;management;system

PKI comprises digital certificates managed by the certificate authorities (CAs) to verify the user's identity, thus providing secure communication channels. However, the security of PKI is profoundly reliant on the reliability of these third-party CAs, which serves as a single point of failure for PKI. Over the past, there have been several incidents of popular CA breaches, where the centralized operation model of CAs caused numerous targeted attacks due to the spread of rogue certificates.In this paper, we aim to make the CA pool completely decentralized and concurrently build our decentralized solution cooperative with established PKI standards (i.e., X.509) for effective real-world integration. In particular, we harness blockchain technology to propose a decentralized PKI framework named ProofChain, which provides complete trust among a decentralized group of CAs. Our proposed solution provides all the traditional X.509 PKI operations (i.e., registration, validation, verification, and revocation), making it compatible with existing PKI standards. We have also evaluated ProofChain against popular security standards (i.e., the CIA triad model) and PKI adversarial attacks. Besides, to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed system, we have also evaluated the performance of the ProofChain by implementing it on the private testbed of the Ethereum network across various real-world PKI scenarios.	public-key infrastructure;blockchain;security;x;509;trust;proofchain
1168	核心技术	Downsampling and Transparent Coding for Blockchain	Blockchain is considered to be able to solve the problem of trust between distributed nodes. However, it's a challenge to store the large amount of data produced by blockchain. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce node storage overhead while ensuring node independence and data recoverability. This paper proposes to downsample these data to reduce the storage overhead of nodes. These nodes keep good independence, if downsampling follows the entropy of blockchain and the block bodies are continuously stored. Moreover, it demonstrates that the entire blockchain history can be efficiently recovered through the cooperative decoding of a group of nodes like fountain codes, if reserved data over these nodes obey the soliton distribution. However, these data on nodes are transparent (stored data are uncoded and can be used directly by the node without decoding). Thus, the proposed algorithm not only keeps decentralization and security, but also has good scalability in independence and recoverability.	blockchains;history;encoding;bitcoin;synchronization;scalability;entropy;blockchain;downsampling;transparent coding;erasure codingframework
1169	协同技术	Image Copyright Protection Based on Blockchain and Zero-Watermark	Generally, image protection is often accomplished by digital watermark, which is also widely used in the field of data protection and data ownership authentication. However, the existing digital watermark has inherent disadvantages, it needs completely trusted third parties to act as the arbitration parties, which may be difficult to achieve. Second, an image watermark algorithm will inevitably lead to the loss of image data when operating on the image data, while it is usually irreversible. The zero-watermark algorithm can solve the problem of data loss but relies more on the trusted third party than a traditional digital watermark, which makes its prospects limited. With the development of blockchain technology in recent years, its features of de-trusted third parties combine the fairness and process automation of smart contracts to make up for the shortcomings of the zero-watermarking algorithm. This paper studies image storage and authentication frameworks. This framework utilizes the advantages of zero-watermarking algorithm and blockchain, using the Inter-Planetary File System to solve the data expansion problem of blockchain, which well avoids the shortcomings of zero-watermarking algorithm and blockchain. Experiment and inference illustrate that the proposed framework is feasible.	blockchains;watermarking;robustness;transforms;discrete wavelet transforms;image storage;stability analysis;zero-watermark;ethereum blockchain;image property protection;inter-planetary file system
1170	协同技术	BC-AKA: Blockchain based asymmetric authentication and key agreement protocol for distributed 5G core network	Secure authentication between user equipment and 5G core network is a critical issue for 5G system. However, the traditional authentication protocol 5G-AKA and the centralized key database are at risk of several security problems, e.g. key leakage, impersonation attack, MitM attack and single point of failure. In this paper, a blockchain based asymmetric authentication and key agreement protocol (BC-AKA) is proposed for distributed 5G core network. In particular, the key used in the authentication process is replaced from a symmetric key to an asymmetric key, and the database used to store keys in conventional 5G core network is replaced with a blockchain network. A proof of concept system for distributed 5G core network is built based on Ethereum and ECC-Secp256k1, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are verified by the experiment results.	authentication;blockchains;encryption;5g mobile communication;cryptography;security;protocols;blockchain;asymmetric authentication;key agreement;distributed core network;5gscheme
1171	协同技术	Smart Mobile Information Systems on the Key Systems of Blockchain Privacy Protection	In the process of data collaboration, the data source copyright, equity boundaries, and other issues must be ensured to ensure the data owner's income rights. The data on the blockchain are transaction data. After the data are verified, they are added to the block by the node that has the right to keep accounts. Once the data are added to the blockchain, they cannot be deleted or changed, and only authorized query operations can be performed. The transaction records on the blockchain are completely public, and the fund transactions between accounts can reflect a lot of valuable information, especially some special accounts track the IP of transaction users through methods such as address reuse, taint analysis, and cluster analysis. At the same time, a credit contribution certification mechanism is established to ensure that the contributions are directly proportional to the rewards, and finally, a credit mechanism for data fraud is established. This paper mainly analyzes the key systems of privacy protection through research data and blockchain. The research results show that different companies conduct the Pallier homomorphic encryption of data and use the secure multiparty calculation to obtain the results. The execution of the whole process is controlled by a specific intelligent contract, and the records of the execution process are stored in the blockchain. It can be seen that the blockchain-based data distribution system changes the traditional data distribution mode so that the data source and the data user can interact directly, which promotes the maintenance of the system's security and stability.	trust
1172	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Vaccine Passport System	In this study, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving vaccine passport system for the global prevention and control of infectious diseases. The system operates a double-chain framework which consists of a public blockchain and a consortium blockchain. Among them, the combination of the immutability of the public blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the supply chain ensures the openness and transparency of the cold chain logistics records of the vaccines covering the stages from auditing to the target vaccination hospitals. The system adopts the consortium blockchain to achieve the balance between the protection of users' vaccination privacy and auditing by the government departments. Specifically, a distributed system-based threshold signature is adopted in the vaccine qualification phase to resist collusion between the vaccine manufacturing company and vaccine approval institutions. The cryptographic tools such as the anonymous credentials, zero-knowledge protocols, and range proofs ensure that users do not disclose any private information other than proving that they have a legally valid vaccine passport when users display the vaccine passports to customs. At the same time, customs can apply various vaccine prevention policies based on the conditions on the specific vaccine passports. Regarding the security properties of the system, a formal security model is given along with the corresponding security proofs.

1174	实体经济	Ontological Representation of Healthcare Application Security Using Blockchain Technology	Blockchain is gaining traction for improving the security of healthcare applications, however, it does not become a silver bullet as various security threats are observed in blockchain-based applications. Moreover, when performing the security risk management (SRM) of blockchain-based applications, there are conceptual ambiguities and semantic gaps that hinder from treating the security threats effectively. To address these issues, we present a blockchain-based healthcare security ontology (HealthOnt) that offers coherent and formal information models to treat security threats of traditional and blockchain-based applications. We evaluate the ontology by performing the SRM of a back-pain patient???s healthcare application case. The results show that HealthOnt can support the iterative process of SRM and can be continually updated when new security threats, vulnerabilities, or countermeasures emerge. In addition, the HealthOnt may assist in the modelling and analysis of real-world situations while addressing important security concerns from the perspective of stakeholders. This work can help blockchain developers, practitioners, and other associated stakeholders to develop secure blockchain-based healthcare applications in the early stages.	blockchain;healthcare;security threats;healthcare security ontologyaccess-control;privacy;sybil;challenges;attacks;systems;scheme;risks

1176	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Sensitive Document Storage to Mitigate Corruptions	Currently, all document processes in developing countries require third-party (human) verification; this makes said documents susceptible to human error. Blockchain technology makes the need for a central authority redundant as the devices needing to download digital assets are connected to one another via a peer-to-peer network. It allows for the exchange and storage of digital assets without the need for third-party oversight. The main objective of this article is to develop a blockchain solution in an attempt to mitigate corruption. The contribution details a document verification process as a solution to lessen third-party access to sensitive information and ensure that it is safe and untampered with. The solution proposed to this issue was the introduction of blockchain technology to aid in document verification. This makes the entire system decentralized and reduces the amount of third-party access to sensitive information. Using blockchain makes documents immutable thus reducing corrupt activity such as identity theft and ghost accounts. A blockchain implementation in the field of document verification also dissolves the need for certified copies, which then allows for better use of state funds and public service workers. This work can prove to be a major enabler to achieve sustainable development goal-16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).	blockchains;biometrics (access control);machine learning;internet of things;peer-to-peer computing;feature extraction;data models;access control;blockchain;corruption;decentralized storage;decision support systems;e-governance;smart services;sustainable development
1177	核心技术	A Pigeon Group Decomposition Based Algorithm for Logistics Service Transaction Matching Under Blockchain	The transmission security problem in the industrial Internet of Things is the focus of industrial manufacturing development. Blockchain technology can well solve this problem. The massive data generated in the Industrial Internet of Things will be transmitted to the blockchain system through the gateway, the throughput and deployment costs need to be considered. This paper proposes a pigeon flock algorithm based on decomposition to solve this problem. It uses the excellent navigation ability of carrier pigeons to improve search efficiency. At the same time, two independent archives are used to balance convergence and diversity. After the solution set in the convergence archives is classified, the solution set is evaluated by the Tchebycheff function, and some better solutions are retained. The diversity archive chooses some solutions that are quite different from other solutions to maintain diversity. This article uses this algorithm to obtain the solutions with low throughput and high deployment when the blockchain is implemented in the Industrial Internet of Things. Finally, 7 questions in the DTLZ test question are selected to prove the validity of the proposed algorithm. These questions have 5, 10, and 15 goals. In the experimental results, it can be seen that the proposed algorithm is better than NSGAIII, MOEADD and NSGAII on most of the test problems.	many-objective optimization;internet of things;two archives;pigeon-inspired optimization;evolutionary algorithmevolutionary algorithm;optimization

1179	实体经济	Visual Analysis of Blockchain Energy Storage Scheduling considering the Optimal Scheduling of User-Side Source and Storage Resources	With the rapid development of Internet technology, the problem of client-side source storage resources is gradually exposed. In view of the problems of small capacity, uneven distribution, and diversification of attributable entities of user-side source storage resources, the current blockchain energy storage is difficult to schedule, and user-side sources and storage resources cannot be added to power scheduling optimization, resulting in unusable resources. In order to effectively utilize user-side resources, this paper proposes a blockchain energy storage scheduling visualization system (BESSVS) that takes into account the optimal scheduling of user-side source storage resources. The BESSVS can coordinate and optimize the management and control of decentralized power resources and load resources, and effectively combine the Internet of Things and the power plant storage energy corresponding to the BESSVS for optimal scheduling. The design of blockchain energy storage scheduling visualization system is mainly carried out from the system main body and data information structure. The advantages of blockchain in data storage, information security, data interoperability, etc., are introduced into the economic scheduling of blockchain energy storage. It is conducive to the stable scheduling of information transparency and also improves the data security and storage security of the system. Finally, the feasibility and practicability of the method are verified by an example.	
1180	实体经济	An IoT-Enabled Stochastic Operation Management Framework for Smart Grids	The idea of Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the smart grids by providing the opportunity for remote control and monitoring of the distributed generations (DGs), switches, renewable sources and electrical loads. This study investigates the smart grid concept along with IoT in the automation and optimal energy management of these grids incorporating the high uncertainties of the renewable energy sources and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) charging demand. A private blockchain technology is developed to make secure data transactions. A novel stochastic structure according to the scenario generation is developed to capture the power randomness of these sources. It is tried to assess the switching effect on the energy management based on remote control in the IoT bed. Moreover, a new optimizer using the social spider algorithm (SSA) is proposed which helps in scheduling the smart grid in an economic way. In addition, a modified method is developed which can suitably enhance the SSA convergence and thus get into more optimal switching and scheduling programs. The proposed model is investigated using an IEEE test system.	smart grids;costs;switches;renewable energy sources;stochastic processes;internet of things;automation;internet of thing (iot);energy management;smart grids;renewable energy sources;phevsnetwork reconfiguration;electric vehicles;security

1182	实体经济	Systemic risks in electricity systems: A perspective on the potential of digital technologies	In the last decades, several developments have transformed electricity systems in Europe towards liberalized and decentralized systems that are coupled inter-sectorally and inter-regionally. These developments have yielded various significant benefits, such as increased efficiency and robustness. However, we argue that they have also caused new interdependencies and complexity with a corresponding increase in associated systemic risks, e.g., local failures may spread faster and more extensively throughout the system. In this paper, we illustrate how systemic risks may arise in European electricity systems by discussing three exemplary developments. We also discuss the decisive role of the digital transformation that, on the one hand, speeds up the transition of electricity systems and challenges electricity systems' stability through rapid change, but on the other hand may also provide solutions to tackle systemic risks. We argue that, especially in a strongly interconnected world, policymakers must implement a global perspective on these critical and increasingly complex systems, requiring adequate cooperation with respect to data. Using an exemplary case from Germany, we finally illustrate how an intensified data exchange may help to address systemic risks. In this context, we draw a perspective on the potential of emerging digital technologies, like self-sovereign identities, blockchains, and privacy-enhancing technologies.	blockchain;energy informatics;privacy-enhancing technologies;renewable energy sources;self-sovereign identities;systemic risksrenewable energy;flexibility;integration;europe;point;oil
1183	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Secure Communication of Intelligent Transportation Digital Twins System	The present work aims to improve the communication security of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) nodes in intelligent transportation through studying the safety of IoV in smart transportation based on Blockchain (BC). An IoV DTs model is built by combining big data with Digital Twins (DTs). Then, regarding the current IoV communication security issues, a secure communication architecture for the IoV system is proposed based on the immutable and trackable BC data. Besides, Wasserstein Distance Based Generative Adversarial Network (WaGAN) model constructs the IoV node risk forecast model. Because the WaGAN model calculates the loss function through Wasserstein distance, the learning rate of the model accelerates remarkably. After ten iterations, the loss rate of the WaGAN model is close to zero. Massive in-vehicle devices in IoV are connected simultaneously to the base station, causing network channel congestion. Therefore, a Group Authentication and Privacy-preserving (GAP) scheme is put forward. As users increase during authentication, the GAP scheme performs better than other authentication access schemes. In summary, the Intelligent Transportation System driven by DTs can promote intelligent transportation management. Besides, introducing BC into IoV can improve access control's accuracy and response efficiency. The research reported here has significant value for improving the security of the information sharing of the IoV.	security;encryption;data models;computational modeling;6g mobile communication;vehicles;real-time systems;internet of vehicles;digital twins;blockchain;secure communication;intelligent transportationauthentication scheme;internet;architecture;framework;vehicle
1184	实体经济	Multiaccess Edge Integrated Networking for Internet of Vehicles: A Blockchain-Based Deep Compressed Cooperative Learning Approach	Recently, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Machine Learning (ML) have attracted more and more attention. Considering inefficient real-time training and high requirements on computing capabilities of centralized data collection, performing Distributed Machine Learning (DML) in IoV has become an important research branch. However, the heterogeneity, mobility, and distrust among IoV nodes affect how to execute DML effectively, securely, and in a salable manner. In this paper, a blockchain-based Cooperative Learning framework combined with a Deep Compression method (CLDC) is proposed. First, we improve the local training efficiency of lightweight IoV nodes by using deep compression method. Meanwhile, we have introduced a blockchain system in CLDC, the significance of which is that we have completed the transformation from centralized architecture to distributed framework through the blockchain, and shared local training results in a verifiable manner. The framework uses non-tamperable features of the blockchain to ensure the security of local training results. Moreover, we propose a Learning-based Redundant Byzantine Fault Tolerance (L-RBFT) protocol, in which the primary node needs to confirm the loss percentage of learning in the transaction before forwarding the RBFT messages. The significance of L-RBFT is to ensure that IoV nodes obtain the best training results through the consensus of blockchain nodes. We use it to solve the computing and communication resource allocation problem in IoV to clarify the operating mechanism of the proposed framework. The experimental results prove that this scheme performs better when compared with the traditional centralized deep reinforcement learning method.	blockchains;computer architecture;training;servers;deep learning;neural networks;peer-to-peer computing;internet of vehicles;blockchain;cooperative q-learning;deep neural network compression

First, we propose a K-anonymous location protection scheme for multiuser cooperation, which can protect the location privacy of primary users by generalizing their location information through the construction of anonymous areas. Then, we design an incentive mechanism, which performs reporting and adjudication strategy through the transaction stored in blockchain. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively prevent the privacy leakage of primary users' location and encourage them to actively participate in spectrum sharing in IoV.	
1186	实体经济	Using Blockchain Technology and Sharing Culture to Promote Sustainable Forest Management in Tribal Communities	Forest protection is crucial to ensuring the balance between human beings and ecology. This study explores the key role played by communities that originally lived in forest-protected areas in implementing the traditional management of forests. The unified management mode previously used by the state power can no longer meet the demands of modern times; hence, multiple types of management systems should be implemented to enable adaption to the original ecology of forest areas. A multimodal management mode should be adopted to restore the original ecology of forest areas. The adoption of this management system can restore a forest to its original state (i.e., the state that existed prior to the entry of state power). The forest has been in a state of ecological balance involving numerous species since ancient times. However, in the modern field of science, the passive restoration of a community's self-governance ability could be unsustainable and unstable. To improve this situation, blockchain technology can first be used to improve the community management of a forest, such that the capabilities of the original local community can be improved; second, tourism promotion benefits both the community and the forest. When a community in a forest develops the tourism industry with the support of blockchain technology, the information and resources of all parties can be widely connected with the larger world, and this considerably increases success rates; finally, the traditional spiritual culture of a community, such as the culture of sharing, should be promoted. In addition to the skillful utilization of technology, culture can improve the traditional forest management ability of tribal communities who live in native forest areas in terms of their personality traits. Overall, we conclude that: against the evolution history of the over one hundred years, the adoption of new technology for forest management is inherently a creative innovation for the tribal community's entrepreneurial development.	conservation;ecotourism;peoples;context
1187	实体经济	BRINGING TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSPARENCY TO TENEBROUS MARKETS: THE CASE FOR USING BLOCKCHAIN TO VALIDATE CARBON CREDIT TRADING MARKETS	Carbon reductions have become a priority as companies and other entities emitting greenhouse gases seek to comply with regulatory requirements and commit to voluntary goals that are consistent with their sustainability pledges. These carbon reductions are accounted for by carbon credits, which are tradeable units of carbon reduction that can be used to comply with regulatory or voluntary carbon reduction credits. Many companies are making such carbon reduction promises, and are frequently relying on credits generated by non-traditional mitigation sources such as agriculture or forestry to achieve those reductions and credits. However, the credibility and reliance on such carbon credit markets is seriously undermined by the reality and perception of double counting, lack of transparency, and greenwashing. Blockchains and smart contracts can address many of the monitoring and transparency shortcomings of current carbon credit markets, and hence provide greater trust and veracity to carbon reduction claims to meet regulatory or voluntary commitments. This article describes the growing role of carbon credit markets, their current shortcomings, and describes existing and proposed mechanisms for using blockchain and smart contracts to overcome those existing problems.	
1188	实体经济	Impact of Traceability Technology Adoption in Food Supply Chain Networks	Improving traceability in food supply chains has been a big part of ongoing effort to reduce contamination risks and food waste. Recent technology advancement such as blockchain technology has propelled innovative retailers to promote food traceability system adoption in their supply chains. We develop a three-tier supply chain model with multiple upstream (tier 2) suppliers to investigate how traceability technology adoption affects incentives of supply chain members and whether and how its anticipated benefits can be realized. We find that full traceability brings direct revenue benefit to every supply chain member by saving uncontaminated food from disposal (pure traceability effect) but also leaves each tier of the supply chain vulnerable to its immediate downstream buyer's exploitation through strategically lowering the purchasing price (strategic pricing effect). The interplay of the two effects may result in some of the supply chain members (even the retailer) being worse off with traceability adoption and the system being exposed to higher contamination risk; the latter is because of the weakened upstream supplier's incentive to exert contamination risk-reduction effort. Moreover, we find that the supply chain network structure also influences the benefit distribution of traceability adoption: The retailer always benefits from traceability adoption in network structures where the tier 1 supplier's strategic pricing power is eliminated or weakened; all supply chain members benefit from traceability adoption in a network with a large number of tier 2 suppliers. Finally, we show that alternative risk-mitigation schemes such as tier 2 coordination can diminish the value of traceability adoption, and partial traceability enabled by tier 1 product inspection can be more beneficial to the retailer than full traceability.	traceability;technology adoption;multitier food supply chain;food contaminationdiversification;adulteration
1189	实体经济	Green supply chain innovation: Emergence, adoption, and challenges	Alongside many studies on greening efforts for supply chain activities, there is a research gap in understanding the emergence and adoption of green supply chain innovation (GSCI) in this digital-enabled Industry 4.0 era. This study defines GSCI as innovation practices by manufacturers that apply emergent digital technologies to integrate environmental concerns into supply chain management activities. GSCI is evolving as a new paradigm of green supply chain management (GSCM) to elevate its five underlying implementation dimensions. Manufacturing enterprises can benefit from digital technology applications to enhance efficiency of environmental outcomes of their GSCM activities, including internal environmental management, green purchasing, customer cooperation, inventory recovery, and eco-design. The GSCI concept gains growing attention in research and practice with popular digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cloud computing, and big data analytics increasingly adopted by manufacturers to improve their GSCM. So far, the literature lacks studies on GSCI to examine the concept, investigate the practices, explain the adoption motivations, consolidate and extend the knowledge on its adoption and diffusion. Based on a comprehensive review of GSCM literature, we explain the innovation for GSCM, and discuss the GSCI concept and practice focusing on digital technology applications with examples, and identify the challenges and opportunities for GSCI adoption and diffusion. We extend knowledge for this emerging GSCM field on digital technology applications.	green supply chain;innovation;environmental;digital technology;adoptioncyber-physical system;management-practices;circular economy;internet;things;performance;framework;optimization;operations;resources
1190	实体经济	Disease Information Dissemination Prevention and Risk Management Methods in the Blockchain Environment	With the advancement of technology and the arrival of the era of integrated media, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and virtual reality are gradually changing the ecology of public opinion. This will bring new challenges to the technical discovery, data analysis, and response of network disease dissemination to public opinion. Internet data barriers are still widespread. The specific requirements are to explore the application mode of blockchain technology to bring a better service experience to the people. Therefore, this paper focuses on the dissemination of disease public opinion information and risk management research in the blockchain environment. Furthermore, the application of advanced blockchain technology is used to seek breakthroughs in the field of risk management of network disease transmission and public opinion in terms of technology and data. This paper systematically sorts out the research results of domestic and foreign disease transmission network public opinion, public opinion risk management, and blockchain through comprehensive use of literature analysis, grounded research, empirical research, simulation research, and other research methods. Based on theories of the disease transmission network, public opinion, risk management, blockchain, and system dynamics, we conduct research on network public opinion and risk management of disease transmission in the block chain environment. At the theoretical level, the research in this paper can promote the risk management of disease transmission network public opinion in the blockchain environment and carry out the construction of the theoretical system to deepen the application of blockchain technology in the field of disease public opinion risk management. At the practical level, the research in this paper can guide the improvement of the effect of public opinion risk management. Then, blockchain technology is applied to manage the risk of disease public opinion. In future research, the theory of public opinion risk management will be further enriched. We will apply blockchain technology to develop the evolution of the risk of disease public opinion transmission, carry out research on public opinion management and other aspects, and at the same time, try the design and development of a blockchain public opinion system. In this way, the innovation of blockchain in the development and application of disease network public opinion research will be promoted.	model;legitimacy;networks
1191	核心技术	An Implementation of Trust Chain Framework with Hierarchical Content Identifier Mechanism by Using Blockchain Technology	Advances in information technology (IT) and operation technology (OT) accelerate the development of manufacturing systems (MS) consisting of integrated circuits (ICs), modules, and systems, toward Industry 4.0. However, the existing MS does not support comprehensive identity forensics for the whole system, limiting its ability to adapt to equipment authentication difficulties. Furthermore, the development of trust imposed during their crosswise collaborations with suppliers and other manufacturers in the supply chain is poorly maintained. In this paper, a trust chain framework with a comprehensive identification mechanism is implemented for the designed MS system, which is based and created on the private blockchain in conjunction with decentralized database systems to boost the flexibility, traceability, and identification of the IC-module-system. Practical implementations are developed using a functional prototype. First, the decentralized application (DApp) and the smart contracts are proposed for constructing the new trust chain under the proposed comprehensive identification mechanism by using blockchain technology. In addition, the blockchain addresses of IC, module, and system are automatically registered to InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), individually. In addition, their corresponding hierarchical CID (content identifier) values are organized by using Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which is employed via the hierarchical content identifier mechanism (HCIDM) proposed in this paper. Based on insights obtained from this analysis, the trust chain based on HCIDM can be applied to any MS system, for example, this trust chain could be used to prevent the counterfeit modules and ICs employed in the monitoring system of a semiconductor factory environment. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme could work in practice under the much lower costs, compared to the public blockchain, with a total cost of 0.002094 Ether. Finally, this research is developed an innovation trust chain mechanism that could be provided the system-level security for any MS toward Industrial 4.0 in order to meet the requirements of both manufacturing innovation and product innovation in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).	trust chain framework;blockchain;comprehensive identification mechanism;manufacturing innovation and product innovationindustry 4.0;intelligent;configuration;internet;system;things
1192	实体经济	Is blockchain the breakthrough we are looking for to facilitate genomic data sharing? The European Union perspective	The recent progress of genomics research is providing unprecedented insight into human genetic variance, susceptibility to disease and risk stratification. Current trends predict that a massive amount of genomic data will be produced in the upcoming years which, when coupled with the fast-paced development of the field, will create new social, ethical, and legal challenges. In the complex legislative environment of the European Union, genomic data sharing policies will have to weigh the benefits of scientific discovery against the ethical risks posed by the act of sharing sensitive data. In this complex, interconnected environment, blockchain provides a unique and novel solution to accountability, traceability, and transparency issues regarding genomic data sharing. Implementing a distributed ledger technology-based database could empower both patients and citizens to responsibly use genomic data pertaining to them because it allows for a higher degree of control over the recipients of their data and their uses. The blockchain technology will engage both data owners and policymakers to address the multiple issues of genomic data sharing and allow us to redefine the way we look at genomics.	genomics;blockchain;data;tokenization;distributed ledger;european union
1193	实体经济	Urban monitoring, evaluation and application of COVID-19 listed vaccine effectiveness: a health code blockchain study	Objective By using health code blockchain, cities can maximise the use of personal information while maximising the protection of personal privacy in the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of listed vaccines. Design This study constructs an urban COVID-19 listed vaccine effectiveness (VE) monitoring, evaluation and application system based on the health code blockchain. This study uses this system and statistical simulation to analyse three urban application scenarios, namely evaluating the vaccination rate (VR) and determining the optimal vaccination strategy, evaluating herd immunity and monitoring the VE on variant. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes first establish an urban COVID-19 listed VE monitoring, evaluation and application system by using the health code blockchain, combined with the dynamic monitoring model of VE, the evaluation index system of VE and the monitoring and evaluation system of personal privacy information use, and then three measures are analysed in urban simulation: one is to take the index reflecting urban population mobility as the weight to calculate the comprehensive VR, the second is to calculate the comprehensive basic reproduction number (R) in the presence of asymptomatic persons, the third is to compare the difference between the observed effectiveness and the true effectiveness of listed vaccines under virus variation. Results Combining this system and simulation, this study finds: (1) The comprehensive VR, which is weighted to reflect urban population mobility, is more accurate than the simple VR which does not take into account urban population mobility. Based on population mobility, the algorithm principle of urban optimal vaccination strategy is given. In the simulation of urban listed vaccination involving six regions, programmes 1 and 5 have the best protective effect among the eight vaccination programmes, and the optimal vaccination order is 3-5-2-4-6-1. (2) In the presence of asymptomatic conditions, the basic reproduction number, namely R0*(1-VR*VE), does not accurately reflect the effect of herd immunity, but the comprehensive basic reproduction number (R) should be used. The R is directly proportional to the proportion of asymptomatic people (aw) and the duration of the incubation period (ip), and inversely proportional to the VR, the VE and the number of days transmitted in the ip (k). In the simulation analysis, when symptomatic R0=3, even with aw=0.2, the R decreases to nearly 1 until the VR reaches 95%. When aw=0.8, even when the entire population is vaccinated, namely VR=1, the R is 1.688, and still significantly greater than 1. If the R is to be reduced to 1, the VE needs to be increased to 0.87. (3) This system can more comprehensively and accurately grasp the impact of the variant virus on urban VE. The traditional epidemiological investigation can lose the contacts of infected persons, which leads to the deviation between the observed effectiveness and the true effectiveness. Virus variation aggravates the loss, and then increases the deviation. Simulation case 1 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.8, the ongoing VR of 0.1, the completed VR of 0.1 and an average infection rate of 2% for the variant virus. If a vaccine is more than 90% effectiveness against the premutant virus, but only 80% effectiveness against the mutant virus, and because 80% of the unvaccinated people who are not infected are not observed, the observed effectiveness of the vaccine is 91.76%, it will lead to the wrong judgement that the VE against the variant virus is not decreased. Simulation case 2 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0. 8, the ongoing VR of 0.1, the completed VR of 0.1 and an average infection rate of 5% for the variant virus. Simulation finds that the higher the proportion of unvaccinated infected people who are not observed, the lower the estimate of observed effectiveness; and the lower the true effectiveness, the larger the gap between observed effectiveness and true effectiveness. Simulation case 3 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.2, the ongoing VR of 0.2, the completed VR of 0.6 and an average infection rate of 2% for the variant virus. Simulation finds that the higher the proportion of unobserved completed vaccination patients who are not infected, the lower the estimate of observed effectiveness; and the lower the true effectiveness, the larger the gap between observed effectiveness and true effectiveness. Simulation case 4 assumes the unvaccinated rate of 0.2, the ongoing VR of 0.2, the completed VR of 0.6 and an average infection rate of 5% for the variant virus. If a vaccine is more than 90% effectiveness against the premutant virus, but only 80% effectiveness against the mutant virus, and because 80% of the infected people with complete vaccination are not observed, the observed effectiveness of the vaccine is 91.95%, similar to case 1, it will lead to the wrong judgement that the VE against the variant virus is not decreased. Conclusion Compared with traditional epidemiological investigation, this system can meet the challenges of accelerating virus variation and a large number of asymptomatic people, dynamically monitor and accurately evaluate the effectiveness of listed vaccines and maximise personal privacy without locking down the relevant area or city. This system established in this study could serve as a universal template for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 listed vaccines in cities around the world. If this system can be promoted globally, it will promote countries to strengthen unity and cooperation and enhance the global ability to respond to COVID-19.	covid-19;health policy;epidemiologysars-cov-2 variant;efficacy;epidemic;china
1194	实体经济	Open Logistics: Blockchain-Enabled Trusted Hyperconnected Logistics Platform	The digitalization and adoption of advanced technologies in supply chain and logistics not only change the business model but also transfer logistics infrastructure to a service-oriented architecture and introduce new avenues concerning supply chain 4.0 (SC4.0). Sharing logistic assets between various businesses leads to improving logistics work, enhancing work productivity, and reducing logistics expenses and environmental impact. However, due to the lack of a secure, trustworthy, and open sharing platform, the companies are not willing to rely on sharing economics. Aiming to improve trust-ability, openness, and interoperability in the SC4.0, this paper presents a blockchain-enabled hyperconnected logistics platform. Firstly, the Open Logistic platform (OL) is proposed, and the key characteristics of this platform are explained. Secondly, the concept of proof of delivery (PoD) based on smart contracts is defined and developed to explore its rule-based management and control among the dynamic assets sharing. Thirdly, the Blockchain asset sharing service is designed and discussed in the context of asset sharing. Fourthly to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed platform, a simulation environment is developed, and OL is implemented based on the case study.	open logistics;blockchain;supply chain 4;0;hyperconnected;asset sharing;trust-abilitysupply chain;sharing economy;service
1195	协同技术	Trust Model Concept for IoT Blockchain Applications as Part of the Digital Transformation of Metrology	Trends for the digital transformation of metrology and regulation of metrology through IT have some keywords in common with the main properties of the blockchain, such as traceability, immutability, and machine-readable documents. The possible applicability of the blockchain as an innovative IT solution for metrology regulation is known in the scientific community. Still, blockchain implementation must consider the entire metrology pyramid-the technical aspects and the legal framework intrinsic to metrology. This is also valid for possible IoT blockchain applications. In resolving the issues, this paper applies a bottom-up approach, starting from IoT devices analyzed as oracles and building up to the sole definition of measurement units, thereby discussing technical aspects concerning relevant standardization documents. The resulting trust model concept encompasses the vertical and horizontal traceability of the measurement results (oracle data), where normative standards and legal requirements are crucial for building trust. Conclusively, for practical implementations, it will be necessary to analyze blockchain properties and applicability with a view to the standard requirements, as shown for WELMEC.	blockchain;iot;metrology
1196	技术治理	FAWPA: A FAW Attack Protection Algorithm Based on the Behavior of Blockchain Miners	Blockchain has become one of the key techniques for the security of the industrial internet. However, the blockchain is vulnerable to FAW (Fork after Withholding) attacks. To protect the industrial internet from FAW attacks, this paper proposes a novel FAW attack protection algorithm (FAWPA) based on the behavior of blockchain miners. Firstly, FAWPA performs miner data preprocessing based on the behavior of the miners. Then, FAWPA proposes a behavioral reward and punishment mechanism and a credit scoring model to obtain cumulative credit value with the processed data. Moreover, we propose a miner's credit classification mechanism based on fuzzy C-means (FCM), which combines the improved Aquila optimizer (AO) with strong solving ability. That is, FAWPA combines the miner's accumulated credit value and multiple attack features as the basis for classification, and optimizes cluster center selection by simulating Aquila's predation behavior. It can improve the solution update mechanism in different optimization stages. FAWPA can realize the rapid classification of miners' credit levels by improving the speed of identifying malicious miners. To evaluate the protective effect of the target mining pool, FAWPA finally establishes a mining pool and miner revenue model under FAW attack. The simulation results show that FAWPA can thoroughly and efficiently detect malicious miners in the target mining pool. FAWPA also improves the recall rate and precision rate of malicious miner detection, and it improves the cumulative revenue of the target mining pool. The proposed algorithm performs better than ND, RSCM, AWRS, and ICRDS.	blockchain;faw attack;proof of work;malicious miner detection;industrial internet
1197	市场治理	Influence of blockchain technology in SME internationalization: Evidence from high-tech SMEs in India	This study examines the impact of blockchain technology (BCT) on small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) internationalization. Further, it examines how Amazon as a platform reframes the global partnership environment via the BCT network that enables Indian SMEs to operate globally. Data were collected from 291 employees at 43 high-tech SMEs in India. They revealed untapped interest in how Indian SMEs will use Amazon for global operations. Several factors, such as processes to strategize, synergize, and standardize, are described as needing to be addressed before SMEs can boost integrated business efficiency, especially with regards to marketing capacity, scale, scope, and financial performance. The study represents a critical theoretical contribution to Amazon-based global operations by developing the 3S Triangle Model, which could provide a basis for future business practice. Furthermore, the study defines and addresses the evolution of BCT that Amazon has used-and continues to use-as a global operations platform. At the convergence of BCT, Amazon, and global retail activities, we propose and advance an integrated model of BCT-driven global operations among SMEs that provides a holistic view of state-of-the-art practices and exciting avenues for future study.	blockchain technology;smes;global operations;high-tech firms;3s triangle model;amazon;structural equation modelingentrepreneurial orientation;dynamic capabilities;marketing capability;mediating role;supply chain;mobile apps;performance;innovation

This integrated approach allows the construction of a diversified portfolio of eight cryptocurrencies and determines an optimal allocation strategy making it possible to minimize the conditional value-at-risk of the portfolio and maximise the return. Our results show that stablecoins such as True-USD are negatively correlated to the other cryptoassets in the portfolio and could therefore be a safe haven for crypto-investors during market turmoil. Our findings are in line with previous studies exhibiting stablecoins as potential diversifiers.	multivariate t-copula;cvar;differential evolution algorithm;k-means clustering;vine copula;cryptocurrency

This study focuses on a cross-border credit information sharing platform based on blockchain 3.0 and its legal guarantee, with an aim to promote the integrated development of credit reporting across the Taiwan Straits. This study first points out the difficulties of cross-border credit information sharing; second, the technical characteristics of blockchain such as distributed storage, point-to-point transmission, security and credibility, open source, and programmability are naturally suitable for solving the information sharing problems in the credit reporting industry. So, this study proposes a framework and a specific design of a cross-strait credit information sharing platform based on blockchain 3.0 infrastructure; finally, in order to ensure the smooth operation of the platform, this study suggests signing a series of nonnormative "soft law" documents in the principles of equality, willingness, and consultation to provide legal guarantee for cross-border credit sharing.	
1200	实体经济	Exploring Blockchain Technology and Enterprise Resource Planning System: Business and Technical Aspects, Current Problems, and Future Perspectives	An Enterprise Resource-Planning (ERP) system is a complex, highly integrated software package for business organizations. However, an ERP system still has its limits, since the ERP business model is centered around individual enterprises. Today there is a great need for closer interactions between enterprises worldwide, a necessity that ERP systems face great difficulties with, when expanding to a full-on ecosystem. By integrating Blockchain Technology (BT) with ERP, we are entering a new epoch of decentralization, allowing organizations to function frictionless in a unified ecosystem. This study highlights the importance of integrating BT and ERP systems as well as explores the major prospective pillars for utilizing BT and ERP. This paper contributes to the academic literature, since there is little research evidence concerning the technical and business aspects of BT and ERP, so it fills the gap by exploring the main potential areas for deploying BT and ERP systems.	bt;erp;business;ledger;distributed;baasindustry 4.0
1201	实体经济	Towards a Secure and Scalable Maritime Monitoring System Using Blockchain and Low-Cost IoT Technology	Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is a strategic field of study that seeks to provide a coastal country with an effective monitoring of its maritime resources and its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In this scope, a Maritime Monitoring System (MMS) aims to leverage active surveillance of military and non-military activities at sea using sensing devices such as radars, optronics, automatic Identification Systems (AISs), and IoT, among others. However, deploying a nation-scale MMS imposes great challenges regarding the scalability and cybersecurity of this heterogeneous system. Aiming to address these challenges, this work explores the use of blockchain to leverage MMS cybersecurity and to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and availability of relevant navigation data. We propose a prototype built on a permissioned blockchain solution using HyperLedger Fabric-a robust, modular, and efficient open-source blockchain platform. We evaluate this solution's performance through a practical experiment where the prototype receives sensing data from a Software-Defined-Radio (SDR)-based low-cost AIS receiver built with a Raspberry Pi. In order to reduce scalability attrition, we developed a dockerized blockchain client easily deployed on a large scale. Furthermore, we determined, through extensive experimentation, the client optimal hardware configuration, also aiming to reduce implementation and maintenance costs. The performance results provide a quantitative analysis of the blockchain technology overhead and its impact in terms of Quality of Service (QoS), demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of our solution in the scope of an MMS using AIS data.	permissioned blockchain;maritime monitoring system;hyperledger fabric;automatic identification system;dockerrequirements
1202	实体经济	The Impact of Blockchain Application on the Qualification Rate and Circulation Efficiency of Agricultural Products: A Simulation Analysis with Agent-Based Modelling	In the context of COVID-19, the circulation of agricultural products is increasingly important for the nutrition and health of people. With the changing needs of society and the advancement of technology, the agricultural product circulation system needs to undergo corresponding changes to adapt to the modern fast-paced social system. Blockchain technology couples with the circulation of agricultural products, as its technical features, such as immutability and a distributed ledger database, ensures the speed and stability of the key information circulation process of agricultural products. The research goal of this paper was to clarify the influence of blockchain technology on the qualification rate and circulation efficiency for agricultural products. Based on the main characteristics of blockchain technology and a summary of domestic and foreign theoretical research, this paper simulated the impacts of blockchain technology on the agricultural product circulation system. The results revealed that blockchain technology can improve the qualification rate of agricultural products and thereby ensure their quality and safety. The introduction of blockchain increased the qualification rate by nearly 30%. Moreover, blockchain technology significantly enhanced the efficiency of the agricultural product circulation system, thereby greatly promoting economic benefits. The introduction of blockchain increased circulation efficiency by nearly 15%. Finally, the introduction of blockchain technology can effectively promote the governance level and reduce the supervision costs of the agricultural product circulation system. Through simulation analysis, we found that blockchain technology has a positive impact on both the qualification rate and circulation efficiency for agricultural products. These findings enrich research into the application of blockchain technology in the management and circulation of modern agricultural products.	blockchain;agricultural products;qualification rate;circulation efficiency;simulation analysis;food healthsupply chain;technology
1203	实体经济	Applications of Blockchain Technology in Modern Power Systems: A Brief Survey	In the context of modern power system development to support the evolution towards green energy and carbon-neutral emission goals, many existing problems and even challenges demand new technical solutions. In recent years, decentralized blockchain technology has been employed to address some problems in power systems, and many papers have been published. In this paper, the concept of blockchain is first introduced. A brief survey of the existing publications regarding the applications of blockchain in power systems, including power system dispatching, microgrid operation, energy trading, electricity trading settlement, transmission, and distribution system operation, is then carried out. In addition, several application scenarios of blockchain technology in power systems are also introduced. Through the discussion, we found that we still need to weigh the advantages and disadvantages, overcome its leakage, and bring its value into play if we apply blockchain technology in modern power systems in support of zero carbon goals.	power system;blockchain;information technology;literature surveyenergy trading framework;operation mechanism;multi-microgrids;peer;transaction;secure;market;services
1204	实体经济	A Review on the Adoption of AI, BC, and IoT in Sustainability Research	The rise of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain (BC), and the internet of things (IoT) has had significant applications in the advancement of sustainability research. This review examines how these digital transformations drive natural and human systems, as well as which industry sectors have been applying them to advance sustainability. We adopted qualitative research methods, including a bibliometric analysis, in which we screened 960 publications to identify the leading sectors that apply AI/BC/IoT, and a content analysis to identify how each sector uses AI/BC/IoT to advance sustainability. We identified "smart city", "energy system", and "supply chain" as key leading sectors. Of these technologies, IoT received the most real-world applications in the "smart city" sector under the dimensions of "smart environment" and "smart mobility" and provided applications resolving energy consumption in the "energy system" sector. AI effectively resolved scheduling, prediction, and monitoring for both the "smart city" and "energy system" sectors. BC remained highly theoretical for "supply chain", with limited applications. The technological integration of AI and IoT is a research trend for the "smart city" and "energy system" sectors, while BC and IoT is proposed for the "supply chain". We observed a surge in AI/BC/IoT sustainability research since 2016 and a new research trend-technological integration-since 2020. Collectively, six of the United Nation's seventeen sustainable development goals (i.e., 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13) have been the most widely involved with these technologies.	literature review;sustainability;ai;bc;iot;smart city;energy system;supply chainenergy efficiency;smart city;artificial-intelligence;blockchain technology;big data;framework;internet;optimization;perspectives;simulation
1205	实体经济	Challenges of Using Blockchain in the Education Sector: A Literature Review	Blockchain is one of the latest innovations that is increasingly attracting the attention of various stakeholders in different fields, including the education sector. This is primarily due to its attractive features, such as decentralization, transparency, traceability, security, and reliability. Despite its advantages, blockchain still faces several challenges, and the acceptance rate of this technology is still low. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a review of published articles that have discussed the challenges of adopting blockchain in the education sector. The review contained scientific papers published from 2017 to 2022 and, from the screened records, 32 articles were analyzed in full-text form. In this review, 14 challenges were reported and classified, based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework. In addition, this review showed that organizational and environmental barriers received little attention in the literature, compared to technological barriers.	blockchain;distributed ledgers;blockchain challenges;blockchain in education;decentralized educationtechnology;implement
1206	实体经济	Enabling Fog-Blockchain Computing for Autonomous-Vehicle-Parking System: A Solution to Reinforce IoT-Cloud Platform for Future Smart Parking	With the advent of modern technologies, including the IoT and blockchain, smart-parking (SP) systems are becoming smarter and smarter. Similar to other automated systems, and particularly those that require automation or minimal interaction with humans, the SP system is heuristic in delivering performances, such as throughput in terms of latency, efficiency, privacy, and security, and it is considered a long-term cost-effective solution. This study looks ahead to future trends and developments in SP systems and presents an inclusive, long-term, effective, and well-performing smart autonomous vehicle parking (SAVP) system that explores and employs the emerging fog-computing and blockchain technologies as robust solutions to strengthen the existing collaborative IoT-cloud platform to build and manage SP systems for autonomous vehicles (AVs). In other words, the proposed SAVP system offers a smart-parking solution, both indoors and outdoors, and mainly for AVs looking for vacant parking, wherein the fog nodes act as a middleware layer that provides various parking operations closer to IoT-enabled edge devices. To address the challenges of privacy and security, a lightweight integrated blockchain and cryptography (LIBC) module is deployed, which is functional at each fog node, to authorize and grant access to the AVs in every phase of parking (e.g., from the parking entrance to the parking slot to the parking exit). A proof-of-concept implementation was conducted, wherein the overall computed results, such as the average response time, efficiency, privacy, and security, were examined as highly efficient to enable a proven SAVP system. This study also examined an innovative pace, with careful considerations to combatting the existing SP-system challenges and, therefore, to building and managing future scalable SP systems.	internet of things;cloud computing;fog;edge computing;smart autonomous parking system;radio-frequency identification;blockchain;cryptographysecurity;edge;privacy;things
1207	实体经济	Investment strategy for blockchain technology in a shipping supply chain	In the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, how to promote blockchain technology to improve the efficiency of port customs clearance and logistics transparency has become a hot research question in the shipping industry. In this paper, we investigate the value of blockchain-based vertical cooperation led by a port or a shipping company in a one-to-two shipping service competition model. A status quo scenario and two different investment scenarios led by different stakeholders are constructed, and equilibrium solutions of the Stackelberg game in three scenarios are proposed. Meanwhile, consumer surplus and social welfare under different cooperation frameworks are discussed. We find that i) investment in blockchain technology can significantly increase the profits of shipping supply chain participants. ii) From the point of view of profit, when the investment efficiency of the port and the shipping company satisfies a certain relationship, there is a balanced strategy for both parties to invest in blockchain technology. iii) The more intense the competition for the services of shipping companies, the lower the level of blockchain technology to improve the logistics capabilities of the shipping supply chain participants. iv) The port's investment in blockchain technology brings more consumer surplus and social welfare. The abovementioned findings can provide managerial insights for ports and shipping companies and present decision support for the government to formulate blockchain technology promotion policies.	shipping supply chain;customs clearance efficiency;logistics transparency;blockchain technology;stackelberg gametraffic congestion;incentive analysis;channel;competition;challenges;logistics
1208	实体经济	Decisions for Blockchain Adoption and Information Sharing in a Low Carbon Supply Chain	Enterprises in low-carbon supply chains have been exploring blockchain technology in order to make carbon data transparent. However, there is still some opaque information in the market, such as the value-added service efficiency. How do supply chain members make decisions between information sharing and blockchain adoption? This study considers blockchain adoption and information sharing in a low-carbon supply chain with a single manufacturer and a single retailer. The retailer has private information about value-added services and decides how to share it with the manufacturer. We examine six combined strategies comprised of blockchain scenarios and information sharing formats (no sharing, voluntary sharing, and mandatory sharing). The results indicate that supply chain members prefer blockchain technology under no sharing and voluntary sharing. Under mandatory sharing, supply chain members have incentives to participate in blockchain when the value-added service efficiency exceeds a threshold value. While the manufacturer prefers to obtain the value-added service information, the retailer decides to share information depending on the value-added service efficiency. Besides, supply chain members' attitude toward the sharing contract also depends on the value-added service efficiency.	low-carbon supply chain;blockchain;value-added service;information sharing;game theoryvalue-added service;uncertainty;asymmetry
1209	核心技术	Delegated Proof of Accessibility (DPoAC): A Novel Consensus Protocol for Blockchain Systems	As the backbone of every blockchain application, the consensus protocol is impacted by numerous risks, namely resource requirements and energy consumption, which limit the usage of blockchain. Applications such as IoT/IIoT cannot use these high-cost consensus methods due to limited resources. Therefore, we introduce Delegated Proof of Accessibility (DPoAC), a new consensus technique that employs secret sharing, PoS with random selection, and an interplanetary file system (IPFS).DPoAC is decomposed into two stages. During the initial stage, a secret is generated by a randomly chosen super node and divided into n shares. These shares are encrypted and stored in different n nodes on the IPFS network. The nodes will compete to access these shareholders to reconstruct the secret. The winning node will be awarded block generation rights. PoS with random selection is used in the second stage to compute the appropriate hash value and construct a block with valid transactions. In this novel approach, a node with few computational resources and small stakes can still obtain block generation rights by providing access to secret shares and reconstructing the secret, making the system reasonably fair. We qualitatively analyze and compare our scheme based on performance parameters against existing mainstream consensus protocols in the context of IoT/IIoT networks.	blockchain;consensus;dpoac;secret sharing;ipfs;iot;iiotinternet
1210	实体经济	Can Blockchain Be a Basis to Ensure Transparency in an Agricultural Supply Chain?	Many supply chains within developing countries lack transparency and are fraught with fraud, corruption, and a substantial number of intermediaries. For several decades, the cocoa sector has faced multiple social, economic, and environmental challenges, some of which include the issue of child labor and very low incomes for farmers, leading to poor living conditions. Blockchain technology has a high potential to reduce-or completely eradicate-some of these hurdles. In this article, we present a blockchain-based solution based on the open-source framework Hyperledger Fabric for the cocoa supply chain to promote transparency and reduce fraud. In doing so, we explicitly describe how farmers can be directly integrated into the whole blockchain solution considering the limited infrastructure, knowledge, and technologies available to them. Since about 70% of all cocoa worldwide is produced in West Africa, this case study uses the cocoa sector in Ghana as an example.	sustainability;cocoa;blockchain;supply chain;transparencytechnology
1211	实体经济	Smart Cities and Transportation: Reviewing the Scientific Character of the Theories	The concept "smart city" nowadays designates a plethora of things. The multiple meanings associated with the smart city, and its imperfect synonym the "robotic city", continue to provide a topic of debate. In this paper we aim to present an epistemologically grounded review of articles focused on the concept of "smart city" and its correlatives. The goal of this article is to ascertain whether the scientific character of the theories employed in such articles is discussed and/or ascertained. For this purpose, we used Popper's method of falsification: a theory's scientific character is determined by its falsifiability and eventual falsification. Papers from the literature were extracted using the PRISMA method, and 15 studies were assessed as eligible for analysis. Most conclusions and results expounded in the articles reviewed that claim to be scientific are arguably based on the unsound logic of verification and confirmation rather than falsification. This has the detrimental effect of reducing to the category of logically false universal instantiations the majority of conclusions about (a) smart city services and infrastructures, (b) intelligent transportation systems and (c) blockchain/Internet of Things.	smart city;transportation;epistemologycommunication;iot
1212	实体经济	Use of Blockchain Technology in the Domain of Physical Exercise, Physical Activity, Sport, and Active Ageing: A Systematic Review	Blockchain technology provides a distributed support for information storage and traceability. Recently, it has been booming in a wide variety of domains: finance, food, energy, and health. In the field of physical activity, physical exercise, sport, and active ageing, this technology could also originate some interesting services introducing support for reliable repository of results, for gamification, or for secure data interchange. This systematic review explores the use of blockchain in this context. The objective is to determine to which extent this technology has fulfilled the potential of blockchain to bring these new added-value services. The authors explored 5 repositories in search of papers describing solutions applied to the above-mentioned frame. 17 papers were selected for full-text analysis, and they displayed diverse applications of blockchain, such as Fitness and healthcare, Sport, and Active ageing. A detailed analysis shows that the solutions found do not leverage all the possibilities of blockchain technology. Most of the solutions analyzed use blockchain for managing, sharing, and controlling access to data and do not exploit the possibilities of Smart Contracts or oracles. Additionally, the advantages of the blockchain model have not been fully exploited to engage users using approaches such as gamification.	health promotion;dlt;training;sport activity;ehealth;fitness

1214	实体经济	The Application of Blockchain in Social Media: A Systematic Literature Review	Social media has transformed the mode of communication globally by providing an extensive system for exchanging ideas, initiating business contracts, and proposing new professional ideas. However, there are many limitations to the use of social media, such as misinformation, lack of effective content moderation, digital piracy, data breaches, identity fraud, and fake news. In order to address these limitations, several studies have introduced the application of Blockchain technology in social media. Blockchains can provides transparency, traceability, tamper-proofing, confidentiality, security, information control, and supervision. This paper is a systematic literature review of papers covering the application of Blockchain technology in social media. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review that elucidates the combination of Blockchain and social media. Using several electronic databases, 42 related papers were reviewed. Our findings show that previous studies on the applications of Blockchain in social media are focused mainly on blocking fake news and enhancing data privacy. Research in this domain began in 2017. This review additionally discusses several challenges in applying Blockchain technologies in social media contexts, and proposes alternative ideas for future implementation and research.	blockchain;social media;online network sites;application of blockchainfake news;smart contracts;challenges;deployment;spread
1215	平台项目	Experimental Performance Analysis of a Scalable Distributed Hyperledger Fabric for a Large-Scale IoT Testbed	Blockchain technology, with its decentralization characteristics, immutability, and traceability, is well-suited for facilitating secure storage, sharing, and management of data in decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Despite the increasing development of blockchain platforms, there is still no comprehensive approach for adopting blockchain technology in IoT systems. This is due to the blockchain's limited capability to process substantial transaction requests from a massive number of IoT devices. Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a popular open-source permissioned blockchain platform hosted by the Linux Foundation. This article reports a comprehensive empirical study that measures HLF's performance and identifies potential performance bottlenecks to better meet the requirements of blockchain-based IoT applications. The study considers the implementation of HLF on distributed large-scale IoT systems. First, a model for monitoring the performance of the HLF platform is presented. It addresses the overhead challenges while delivering more details on system performance and better scalability. Then, the proposed framework is implemented to evaluate the impact of varying network workloads on the performance of the blockchain platform in a large-scale distributed environment. In particular, the performance of the HLF is evaluated in terms of throughput, latency, network size, scalability, and the number of peers serviceable by the platform. The obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can provide detailed real-time performance evaluation of blockchain systems for large-scale IoT applications.	blockchain;hyperledger fabric;performance;throughput;latency;scalabilityblockchain

Diagnostics based on the digital footprint depend on wearable technology's ability to gather and extract essential patient data. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies allow the analysis of real-time observed data and continuously developing from data to understand the world surrounding them. To connect and access intelligent healthcare services, people, and devices at any time, a secure wireless mobile communication system is essential. This article suggests a mHealth-based patient monitoring system (mHealth-PMS) based on AI for healthcare 4.0. Mobile healthcare applications motorized by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have enabled people to triage their conditions and preemptive treatment decisions. Information collected has been analysed for substantiating cause, and alert and preventive messages have been immediately sent through the mobile application. The performance analysis has been executed, and the proposed mobile application-based surveillance provided much-enhanced reporting of information quickly on diseases, symptoms, factors, and more. The mHealth-PMS strategy shows an accuracy ratio of 95.6%, monitoring ratio of 93.5%, data management ratio of 94.4%, data security ratio of 91.7%, data privacy ratio of 92.1%, prediction ratio of 95.3%, a cost-effective ratio of 25.5% compared to the existing methods.	artificial intelligence;healthcare 4;0;mobile healthcare (mhealth)internet;things;blockchain;framework

1218	实体经济	Self-Sovereignty Identity Management Model for Smart Healthcare System	An identity management system is essential in any organisation to provide quality services to each authenticated user. The smart healthcare system should use reliable identity management to ensure timely service to authorised users. Traditional healthcare uses a paper-based identity system which is converted into centralised identity management in a smart healthcare system. Centralised identity management has security issues such as denial of service attacks, single-point failure, information breaches of patients, and many privacy issues. Decentralisedidentity management can be a robust solution to these security and privacy issues. We proposed a Self-Sovereign identity management system for the smart healthcare system (SSI-SHS), which manages the identity of each stakeholder, including medical devices or sensors, in a decentralisedmanner in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Environment. The proposed system gives the user complete control of their data at each point. Further, we analysed the proposed identity management system against Allen and Cameron's identity management guidelines. We also present the performance analysis of SSI as compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.	internet of things;blockchain;self-sovereign identity;iomt;security;privacyblockchain;authentication;challenges;internet;scheme

Usage of IoT networks for medical image transmission has significantly reduced the time needed for clinical diagnosis and thereby increasing treatment efficiency. However at present, IoT networks are open to various security threats, which may affect the sensitive and private information that are present in patient's medical image datasets. Existing studies reveal the need of improvisation for secured medical data transmission over IoT networks. In the context to IoT security issues, this research paper proposes blockchain architecture integrated with chaotic encrypted medical image transmission to ensure the high security in medical image transmission. The proposed system incorporates tri-layered architecture such as Image Aware Segmentation (IAS), hybrid chaotic encryption scheme and finally blockchain environment. The extensive experimentation has been carried out in which the performance parameters such as entropy, NACI and UACI (Number of Pixel Change Ratio and Unified Average Changed Intensity) were calculated and analyzed. It is found that the proposed architecture has NPCR as 99.65%, UACI as 33.95% and entropy ideally close to 8. Encryption results show that the proposed architecture exhibited more randomness, which can defend the IoT security threats.	blockchain;entropy;hybrid chaotic encryption;image aware segmentation;medical iot
1220	实体经济	Design of high-speed blockchain-based sidechaining peer to peer communication protocol over 5G networks	Blockchain technology has become the epitome of security due to its traceability, transparency, immutability, and decentralized nature. To deploy blockchain into any network, a wide variety of mathematical operations are needed to be performed. These operations include hashing, block verification, encryption, and mining. Implementation of these operations is highly complex and requires heavy computational operations to be performed in real-time. Thus, high-performance computing engines are needed to develop blockchain systems, which can be done via the design of parallel processing, pipelining, and VLSI process miniaturization. Apart from high-performance computing, blockchain systems require high-performance communication, which enables seamless node-to-node connectivity for a truly decentralized implementation. Current 4(th) Generation (4G) communication models do not have enough throughput which is needed for high-performance blockchain-based communications, due to rapid block transfers for verification, mining, and viewing operations. Thus, 5G networks are the best application for deploying truly decentralized blockchain systems due to their low communication overheads, and high throughput. As the length of the blockchain increases, 5G networks will also face scalability issues due to an exponential increase in packet sizes. This will reduce the QoS performance of large length blockchains, thereby making them less useful for real-time large-scale applications like Industrial IoT, medical data privacy, etc. Thus, in this work, a machine learning-based sidechaining model is proposed, that utilizes a modified Genetic Algorithm powered engine. This engine aims at splitting the underlying blockchain into sidechains, thereby reducing mining complexity and reducing the number of packets needed for communication while maintaining true decentralization. The model is compared with standard blockchain & sidechain implementations in terms of access time, reading delay, and writing delay. It is observed that the model when implemented under 5G network emulation, outperforms existing blockchain and sidechain models in terms of these parameters, thereby making it useful for highly scalable blockchain systems.	blockchain;sidechain;security;decentralization;machine learning

In addition, sometimes price also affects rarity. To overcome these difficulties, I study an NBA digital collectibles market called NBA Top Shot where those concerns are well addressed. By analyzing novel and rich data sets, I find that the elasticity of price with respect to circulation (reverse rarity) is -0.74 on average. I also find that less popular products are more elastic than more popular products are.	rarity;digital collectibles;nba top shot;non-fungible tokens;blockchainscarcity;product
1222	实体经济	Digital Assets and Blockchain-Based Multimedia Data Management	With the emergence of blockchain technology, decentralized and trustworthy platforms for data storage and propagation transactions become available, which can improve the security of the digital assets, i.e., data with their right to use (e.g., authority, ownership, fingerprinting, etc.). However, the security mechanism of blockchain suffers more vulnerabilities when it is being attacked and when managing multimedia data. It remains challenging to secure multimedia data and protect data integrity. Meanwhile, multimedia data could contain critical personal information. Research in privacy-preserving multimedia data management needs to be further studied to enable using and analyzing multimedia digital assets in the decentralized system without personal information leakage. This is an important feature to enable applications, such as surveillance and e-health. While blockchain sheds light on the future of multimedia data management, further research on secure and privacy-preserving management for digital assets and multimedia data is needed.

Mainly the data leak caused by the internal threat posed by authorized personnel to manipulate confidential information. The main objective of this work is to survey the literature to detect the existing techniques to protect against data leakage and to identify the methods used to address the insider threat. For this, a literature review of scientific databases was carried out in the period from 2011 to 2022, which resulted in 42 relevant papers. It was obtained that from 2017 to date, 60% of the studies found are concentrated and that 90% come from conferences and publications in journals. Significant advances were detected in protection systems against data leakage with the incorporation of new techniques and technologies, such as machine learning, blockchain, and digital rights management policies. In 40% of the relevant studies, significant interest was shown in avoiding internal threats. The most used techniques in the analyzed DLP tools were encryption and machine learning.	data leak protection;data leak prevention;dlp;internal threat;classified information security;drminformation;document
1225	实体经济	New approach for fingerprint recognition based on stylometric features with blockchain and cancellable biometric aspects	Applying machine learning techniques and methods in biometric recognition has gained significant attention in recent years as it can provide a better performance, high accuracy, and cancellable biometrics data. This paper proposes a new approach for fingerprint recognition based on machine learning methods and stylometric features. The proposed solution deals with fingerprint recognition, cancellability, stylometry, blockchain and machine learning. This research uses machine learning methods that classify fingerprint templates as a numeric feature instead of using Gabor wavelets and filters. The proposed method gives very high accuracy for biometric fingerprint templates. For these reasons, we additionally consider the use of an internal blockchain in the form of a distributed database that implements all security services, including privacy protection. Because the recognition method is based on machine learning, the generated templates are a numerical data type and take up minimal memory size, which further favors the application of a blockchain and enables implementation even in IoT devices. We generate the fingerprint biometric template by converting an enhanced fingerprint image into a 1-D set of fixed length codes. After that, we extract stylometric features that will be used for classification. The experiment is conducted on the CASIA-FingerprintV5 and achieved excellent results where the CatBoost method with over-sampling (SMOTE) achieved the best results for All_features(42) and GRRF(10) sets with 99.95% accuracy and 99.98%, respectively, and FAR 0.0007 and 0.0003, respectively. In addition, the proposed system significantly decreased the computational costs which makes it suitable for other applications.	machine learning;ensemble learning;random forest;feature selection;blockchainneural-networks;gene selection;classification
1226	元分析	An analysis of the spillover effects based on patents and inter-industrial transactions for an emerging blockchain technology	A simple and robust approach to predict the spillover effects of emerging technologies enables proper formulation of investment strategies. In this study, we propose the method in order to detect industry sectors impacted by the spillover effect of emerging technologies in their early stage. The method integrates patent analysis with input-output analysis to model knowledge spillover among industrial sectors and has the following three steps. The first is an analysis of technological features in industry sectors. Using the IPC group of patents, we characterized each industrial sector by technological features. The second is an analysis of technological features in a given emerging technology. The third is a similarity analysis of the technological features between emerging technology and industry sectors. In this paper, we conducted a case study on blockchain technology. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing the results with the existing reports. We found that the predictive performance became the highest when we used an industrial sector-normalized matrix in patent analysis and producer's price table in input-output analysis. This method is expected to be used for the early detection of spillover effects of emerging technologies.	patent analysis;technology spillover;blockchain impact;input-output table;concordance tableknowledge spillovers;innovation;networks;policy
1227	实体经济	A Novel Multifaceted Trust Management Framework for Vehicular Networks	Maintaining interconnectivity between dynamic vehicular nodes and ensuring trust in vehicular networking is still a challenging issue. It is crucial for the vehicular environments to maintain a stable interconnectivity between the vehicular nodes and further to prevent the vehicular nodes from broadcasting fake messages and simultaneously protect the vehicles against tracking attacks. An efficient Trust Management System (TMS) is proposed in this paper that will ensure trustworthiness and stable interconnectivity between vehicular entities to assure road safety and reliable communication. The proposed approach incorporates a novel timestamp mechanism and block chain concepts to ensure the steady inter-connectivity between the dynamic vehicular nodes. Further, the framework leverages block chain concepts to verify the correctness of the events stored in the Road Side Units (RSUs). It also proposes a versatile hybrid trust model that uses innovative direct and recommended trust evaluation techniques to compute trust between the vehicular entities. Moreover, the framework integrates a threading mechanism to schedule message execution in direct trust evaluation, and clustering techniques to group similar messages in indirect trust evaluation. Various experimental and comparative analyses with other related studies are carried out in a simulated environment to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid trust model. The findings show that the proposed trust model produces an accuracy of 92% in identifying malicious nodes.	blockchains;computational modeling;security;trust management;peer-to-peer computing;safety;privacy;vehicular networks;trust management system (tms);hybrid model (hm);direct trust evaluation;recommended trust evaluation;blockchainmodel
1228	实体经济	AISChain: Blockchain-Based AIS Data Platform With Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree	Since 2002, hundreds of thousands of vessels have equipped the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which continuously broadcasts its identity and location information for vessel collision avoidance. To utilize these scattered AIS data for further analysis, there are multiple AIS data platforms collecting AIS data from vessels around the world through their satellites and land-based stations. Thus, users can obtain AIS data of vessels from these platforms without dedicated devices. However, existing platforms work in silos, and AIS data is distributed across different platforms, resulting in reduced data availability. In addition, AIS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks, which can undermine the authenticity of AIS data. In this paper, we propose AISChain, a secure and fast blockchain-based AIS data platform. AISChain adopts consortium blockchain, which only permits those authorized parties (i.e., AIS data providers) to participate in the consensus protocol, and is compatible with current commodity AIS hardware. Since the whole system is co-maintained by multiple authorized parties, AISChain can integrate AIS data resources in a secure way. For avoiding repeated recording of AIS data on the chain, we design the Dynamic Bloom Filter Tree (DBFT) to realize efficient duplication detection in the transaction verification phase. We also propose the dual signature scheme to clarify the AIS data ownership. Moreover, we leverage the geographical location-based blockchain sharding approach to further improve the scalability of AISChain. We implement a prototype of AISChain, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AISChain. Evaluation results show that the search time of DBFT is negligible (4.3 ms) with an extreme low error ratio (0.4%). Meanwhile, AISChain can achieve more than 730 tx/s throughput even when nodes scale to 36. To the best of our knowledge, AISChain is the first work to apply the blockchain technology to secure the AIS data platform.	artificial intelligence;blockchains;soft sensors;electronic mail;throughput;satellite broadcasting;safety;automatic identification system;blockchain;bloom filter;securityidentification system ais;cybersecurity
1229	核心技术	BPKI: A secure and scalable blockchain-based public key infrastructure system for web services	Frequent attacks on the certificate authority (CA) have exposed the trust problem of the traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) for the web service. For example, malicious certificates issued by compromised CAs are used to impersonate the existing domain, and revoked certificate are still trusted by clients. Blockchain is considered as one of the most potential technologies to enable a more secure and trustworthy PKI. Although a lot of blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to improve or even replace the traditional PKI, there are still some critical issues unsolved. On the one hand, all of existing blockchain-based solutions are still vulnerable to the domain name preemption attack if a malicious or compromised CA registers a certificate for a domain before the rightful domain owner applies for a certificate for the domain. On the other hand, almost all blockchain-based solutions ignore the scalability problem and can hardly satisfy the current requirement (46 tX/s) of only certificate registrations for global web services. In this paper, we propose a secure and scalable blockchain-based PKI solution, which is called BPKI. In BPKI, we introduce new entities called auditors to supervise CA's certificate registration operations to eliminate the domain name preemption attack. Furthermore, we design a new delegated PBFT (DPBFT) consensus using the verifiable pseudo-random functions (VRFs) and a double blockchain structure to solve the scalability problem. It is theoretically proved that BPKI is secure. The simulation and experiment demonstrate that BPKI is superior to the existing blockchain-based PKI solutions in scalability.	public key infrastructure;blockchain;web services;decentralization;authenticationpki
1230	核心技术	Cryptocurrencies trading algorithms: A review	This study conducts a bibliometric analysis and systematic review of cryptocurrency trading algorithms to identify existing gaps in the area. From our standpoint, this is the first study to carry out a deep analysis of price forecasts and portfolio management in cryptocurrencies in addition to analyzing the most relevant studies and authors, trend topics of the area, and identifying countries with the most published studies. During our research, we identified some gaps that can be used for further research. Currently, there are approximately 16,000 cryptocurrencies; however, in majority of the papers, the authors have only used the top 10 ranking market capitalization cryptocurrencies, leaving aside potential minor cryptocurrencies. Thus, trading strategies using Big Data can be a potential research topic, considering the greater number of emerging cryptocurrencies.	bibliometric analysis;cryptocurrencies portfolio;cryptocurrency trading;systematic review
1231	核心技术	Communication complexity of byzantine agreement, revisited	As Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocols find application in large-scale decentralized cryptocurrencies, an increasingly important problem is to design BA protocols with improved communication complexity. A few existing works have shown how to achieve subquadratic BA under an adaptive adversary. Intriguingly, they all make a common relaxation about the adaptivity of the attacker, that is, if an honest node sends a message and then gets corrupted in some round, the adversary cannot erase the message that was already sent-henceforth we say that such an adversary cannot perform "after-the-fact removal". By contrast, many (super-)quadratic BA protocols in the literature can tolerate after-the-fact removal. In this paper, we first prove that disallowing after-the-fact removal is necessary for achieving subquadratic-communication BA. Next, we show new subquadratic binary BA constructions (of course, assuming no after-the-fact removal) that achieve near-optimal resilience and expected constant rounds under standard cryptographic assumptions and a public-key infrastructure (PKI) in both synchronous and partially synchronous settings. In comparison, all known subquadratic protocols make additional strong assumptions such as random oracles or the ability of honest nodes to erase secrets from memory, and even with these strong assumptions, no prior work can achieve the above properties. Lastly, we show that some setup assumption is necessary for achieving subquadratic multicast-based BA.	byzantine agreement;communication complexity;subquadratic;lower bounds
1232	核心技术	The sum of its parts: Analysis of federated byzantine agreement systems	Federated Byzantine Agreement Systems (FBASs) are a fascinating new paradigm in the context of consensus protocols. Originally proposed for powering the Stellar payment network, FBASs can instantiate Byzantine quorum systems without requiring out-of-band agreement on a common set of validators; every node is free to decide for itself with whom it requires agreement. Sybil-resistant and yet energy-efficient consensus protocols can therefore be built upon FBASs, and the "decentrality" possible with the FBAS paradigm might be sufficient to reduce the use of environmentally unsustainable proof-of-work protocols. In this paper, we first demonstrate how the robustness of individual FBASs can be determined, by precisely determining their safety and liveness buffers and therefore enabling a comparison with threshold-based quorum systems. Using simulations and example node configuration strategies, we then empirically investigate the hypothesis that while FBASs can be bootstrapped in a bottom-up fashion from individual preferences, strategic considerations should additionally be applied by node operators in order to arrive at FBASs that are robust and amenable to monitoring. Finally, we investigate the reported "open-membership" property of FBASs. We observe that an often small group of nodes is exclusively relevant for determining liveness buffers and prove that membership in this top tier is conditional on the approval by current top tier nodes if maintaining safety is a core requirement.	byzantine quorum systems;asymmetric trust;byzantine faults;consensus;stellar;blockchain
1233	实体经济	Traceability model based on improved witness mechanism	Traceability system is one of the popular applications of graphic blockchains. However, there are centralisation problems and a long time for final consistency confirmation in the graphic blockchain. In addition, the blockchain system in the traceability application scenario has the problem of insufficient supervision. Therefore, a witness-based graphic blockchain consensus mechanism is proposed. In the consensus mechanism, a verifiable random function is used to screen the publishers of the unit; an SM2 threshold signature is used to sign the unit information to improve the non-repudiation of the traceability information uploaders to the unit information under the supervision of the witness. The improved consistency algorithm cancels the process of finding a stable main chain and makes relatively many nodes to participate in the consensus process. The experimental results show that the graphic blockchain using the improved witness mechanism can reduce the degree of centralisation, shorten the time for new units to reach consensus, and greatly ensure the security and scalability of the blockchain system.	secure

Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from 31 interviewees of the case organizations. We conduct an in-depth case study of successful BC implementation in operations management, by using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens. Findings This study identifies the incompatibility between the affordances of conventional systems and blockchain in coordination/operations management and offers a process model in which a fusion phase enables the affordances to be compatible and then to be actualized. The fusion phase extends A-A theory by transposing and connecting in the context of operations management. The result also shows that blockchain technology has decentralized potentials to address the issues caused by centralized organizations or information systems, while not to replace the intermediary roles of centralized organizations or information systems. Originality/value This study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on blockchain used in operations management, the roles of blockchain enablement and affordance-actualization theory.

1236	实体经济	Knowledge engineering-based DApp using blockchain technology for protract medical certificates privacy	In the Industry 4.0 era, an inherited featured technology, blockchain, plays a vital role in knowledge engineering applications. Blockchain provides privacy to sensitive data as an intelligent agent, so its adoption rate increases in all the advanced domains. Especially in the health care department, blockchain technology usage helps avoid attacks like the Wannacry ransomware attack during 2017. Therefore, this paper described a decentralised application (DApp) expert system using public blockchain to create and maintain official health documents, especially medical certificates. Current existing systems, either paper-based or database or clouds to save the medical certificates, have more scope to do attacks. Hence, proposed a blockchain-based DApp that acts as an interface between intelligent agents, blockchains, and system related to the medical certificates. The main strength of this paper is implementation results, which are not among the maximum literary works currently available. The associate cost for conducting distributed application operations on the blockchain in terms of Gas comprehensively presented here. Furthermore, it consists of comparing the system's non-functional functions by considering blockchain and non-blockchain environments. Also, presented the simulation results with the performance results compared with the existed systems.

1238	实体经济	Development of an Electronic Smart Safe Box Using Private Blockchain Technology	Effective security has become a vital part of our daily routine, for example securing cash, jewelry, documents, and other valuables. One way is to protect these items by keeping them in a safe box. However, current safe boxes are vulnerable to a number of security attacks such as physical, repudiation, anonymously modifying, etc. In this regard, this paper presents a robust smart safe box using the blockchain solution to ensure each transaction and secure it from unauthorized access. Also, it traces back the local safe items by reading back to blockchain data transactions and protecting them from thieves by tracking the burglar with a real-time tracking location Global Positioning System (GPS) tracker and capturing a picture and video recording through the external camera. Similarly, with more security enhancement using the TensorFlow framework to analyze optical detection and identify things inside the box using an internal camera. At the same time, each transaction is stored by using Write Once and Read Many (WORM) patterns saved in local private blockchain data block logs. Finally, it uses three-way authentication mechanisms to unlock the safe box that authenticates the users, (1) face recognition, (2) fingerprint and (3) the keypad password. The performance of the proposed smart safe box is tested by a number of hardware and blockchain tests. The results reveal that the proposed smart safe box ensures safe and authenticated access to the box and records each transaction using blockchain technology. Further, the performance evaluation of the private blockchain significantly improved the integrity and safeness of the proposed smart safe box.	blockchain;safe-box;smart-box;optical detector;security-box;internet of things (iot)internet;iot
1239	协同技术	Access Control and Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based System for Diseases Management	In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is facing several challenges, mainly due to the lack of personal, institutions, and medications in public health systems. Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.	medical services;blockchains;security;diseases;smart contracts;internet of things;privacy;blockchain;healthcare;information and communication technology (ict);internet of things (iot);interplanetary file system (ipfs);proxy re-encryption;remote patient monitoring;securityinternet;framework
1240	实体经济	A novel blockchain-based and proxy-oriented public audit scheme for low performance terminal devices	With the rapid development of cloud computing technology, more and more individuals/organizations are inclined to store their data in cloud server (CS). Cloud storage audit schemes can help data owner (DO) to confirm the integrity of their data, but the existing schemes still have some limitations. On one hand, the existing schemes assume that DO's terminal devices are computationally powerful enough to handle various operations in a timely manner. While in practice, the terminal devices probably are mobile phones, tablets and other devices with low computing power. On the other hand, the existing schemes rely on a fully trusted third-party auditor (TPA), but it is not in line with real application scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a novel blockchain-based and proxy-oriented public audit (BBPOPA) scheme for low performance terminal devices. Firstly, we introduced a trusted proxy authorized by DO, which can process and upload DO's encrypted files. Secondly, we applied blockchain in our scheme and utilized smart contracts instead of untrusted TPA to improve the reliability and stability of audit results. Thirdly, we took advantage of an index table to ensure that our scheme can support dynamic data operation. Finally, security analysis revealed that our scheme is provably secure in random oracle model. Meanwhile, performance analysis demonstrated that our scheme is efficient and especially suitable for low performance terminal devices. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Effects of trait reactance and regulation content on intention to buy cryptocurrency	Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have attracted billions in investment in a short period of time. Currently, there is a move to introduce regulations for crypto trading. The purpose of the current research was to study the effect of trait reactance and messages about freedom-protecting (vs. freedom-restricting) crypto regulations on an individual's attitude toward cryptocurrency and buying intention. The following mediators were examined: (1) positive affect and (2) negative affect (i.e., anger). A total of 566 people took part in a 2 (regulation content: freedom-protecting vs. freedom-restricting) x trait reactance (continuous) between-participants design. The freedom message emphasized that regulations would support an individual investor's right to invest in crypto. The restriction message stated that crypto trading would be restricted to professional investors. Trait reactance was measured with Hong and Page's (1989) Psychological Reactance scale. Results indicated that trait reactance had a positive effect on state reactance and positive affect. The effect of trait reactance on crypto buying intention was mediated by positive affect and anger. Freedom (vs. restriction) messages were associated with an increase in positive affect and decrease in anger. Freedom messages about crypto investing generate a more positive response than messages outlining restrictions to crypto investing.	trait reactance;psychological reactance;positive affect;regulations;bitcoin;crypto;cryptocurrencypsychological reactance;systems

We find that on average, investors react negatively to news that increases the likelihood of securities and transparency-related regulation. We also find that this negative reaction is attenuated for tokens rated higher on quality and transparency by intermediaries, those that have higher levels of disclosure, and listed on more liquid exchanges. The observed variation in token transparency and this muted reaction suggest investors perceive disclosure costs to be lower for tokens in more transparent environments, suggesting that transparency matters to investors.	regulation;transparency;cryptocurrencies;crypto tokens;financial marketseconomic consequences;stock returns;disclosure;adoption;volume;ifrs;information;protection;bitcoin

It is assumed that the adoption of cryptocurrencies would continue to increase. The role of the dependent variables of social influence (SI), transparency (TR), price value (PV), traceability (TRA), and attitude (AT) was examined to identify customer satisfaction as a mediator variable for cryptocurrency adoption. Random sampling was used to ensure that the research objectives were adequately examined. A total of 295 respondents answered the survey questions intended for cryptocurrency users in Malaysia. Data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-LSM). The findings revealed that SI, PV, TRA, and AT were all impactful in terms of AD (dependent variable) through the mediation of customer satisfaction in Malaysia's digital market. However, TR negatively impacts Malaysia's digital market. Future researchers in other regions and industries may be able to reproduce these findings and use similar constructs to add to the present body of knowledge. This study adds to the small body of literature on Bitcoin and digital money. These findings can assist researchers in understanding the role of cryptocurrency and identifying its primary influences on the Malaysian cryptocurrency market.	social influence;transparency;price value;traceability;attitude;customer satisfaction;adoptioninformation-technology;pls-sem;user acceptance;unified theory;model;determinants;computers;intention;commerce;people
1246	市场治理	The early bird catches the worm: The role of regulatory uncertainty in early adoption of blockchain's cryptocurrency by fintech ventures	Regulatory uncertainty about a technology confronts new technology-based firms (NTBFs) with questions of whether or not to adopt this technology. Following institutional theory, NTBFs are expected not to adopt a technology until regulatory uncertainty has been reduced. However, following the resource-based view, NTBFs are expected to adopt the technology under regulatory uncertainty due to limited or no regulation, as this provides them with an opportunity to secure competitive resources. We investigate whether regulatory uncertainty enabled or inhibited 108 fintech ventures in adopting blockchain's core application, cryptocurrency, in a time when governments were still considering potential regulation.

1247	市场治理	Platform Tokenization: Financing, Governance, and Moral Hazard	This paper highlights two channels through which blockchain-enabled tokenization can alleviate moral hazard frictions between founders, investors, and users of a platform: token financing and decentralized governance. We consider an entrepreneur who uses outside financing and exerts private effort to build a platform and users who decide whether to join in response to the platform's dynamic transaction fee policy. We first show that raising capital by issuing tokens rather than equity mitigates effort under-provision because the payoff to equity investors depends on profit, whereas the payoff to token investors depends on transaction volume, which is less sensitive to effort. Second, we show that decentralized governance associated with tokenization eliminates a potential holdup of platform users, which in turn alleviates the need to provide users with incentives to join, reducing the entrepreneur's financing burden. The downside of tokenization is that it puts a cap on how much capital the entrepreneur can raise. Namely, if tokens are highly liquid, that is, they change hands many times per unit of time, their market capitalization is small relative to the net present value (NPV) of the platform profits, limiting how much money one can raise by issuing tokens rather than equity. If building the platform is expensive, this can distort the capacity investment. The resulting tradeoff between the benefits and costs of tokenization leads to several predictions regarding adoption.	blockchain;ico;cryptocurrency;token;platform;entrepreneurial finance;agency;moral hazard;governanceblockchains;competition

As a result of its geographic location, this community has never been able to access electricity and other modern amenities. This study aims to design and implement a P2P energy trading system for this remote community that allows residents to take advantage of distributed energy resources. A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (Pi4B) hosts the main server of the trading system that includes the user interface and a local Ethereum blockchain server. The Ethereum blockchain is used to deploy smart contracts. The Internet-of-Things (IoT) servers run on ESP32 microcontrollers. Sensors and actuators connected to the ESP32 are field instrumentation devices that facilitate acquiring, monitoring, and transferring energy data in real-time. To perform trading activities, React.JS open-source library was used to develop the blockchain-enabled user interface. An immutable blockchain network keeps track of all transactions. The proposed system runs on a local Wi-Fi network with restricted authorization for system security. Other security measures such as login credentials, private key, firewall, and secret recovery phrases are also considered for information security and data integrity. A Hypertext Transfer Protocol is implemented for communication between the servers and the client. This explains the overall system design, implementation, testing, and results.	peer-to-peer (p2p);distributed generation (dg);internet-of-things (iot);blockchain;hypertext transfer protocol;open-sourceiot

1251	协同技术	SFedChain: blockchain-based federated learning scheme for secure data sharing in distributed energy storage networks	The intelligence of energy storage devices has led to a sharp increase in the amount of detection data generated. Data sharing among distributed energy storage networks can realize collaborative control and comprehensive analysis, which effectively improves the clustering and intelligence. However, data security problems have become the main obstacle for energy storage devices to share data for joint modeling and analysis. The security issues caused by information leakage far outweigh property losses. In this article, we first proposed a blockchain-based machine learning scheme for secure data sharing in distributed energy storage networks. Then, we formulated the data sharing problem into a machine-learning problem by incorporating secure federated learning. Innovative verification methods and consensus mechanisms were used to encourage participants to act honestly, and to use well-designed incentive mechanisms to ensure the sustainable and stable operation of the system. We implemented the scheme of SFedChain and experimented on real datasets with different settings. The numerical results show that SFedChain is promising.	blockchain;data sharing;federated learning;smart contract;energy storagedifferential privacy;big data
1252	实体经济	Blockchain Technology in the Management of Scientific and Technological Achievement Transformation in Chinese Universities	The article uses blockchain technology to design and develop a blockchain-based management system for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements in universities, which solves the problems of difficulty in promoting information of scientific and technological achievements, low trust of both parties in the process of transformation, and lack of corresponding service platform. It solves the problems such as low trust between the two parties and lack of a corresponding service platform. The main research work of the article is as follows: first, it conducts demand analysis, proposes the overall architecture of the system, and designs the scientific research results management module. The system is divided into two parts, namely, user information management module and result information management module. Second, the data protection module is designed. A trust-optimised consensus algorithm C-DPOS is introduced to provide basic technical support for the operation of the blockchain-based university science and technology results trading and knowledge sharing system, thereby reducing the probability of malicious nodes committing mischief in the blockchain network environment during the operation of knowledge sharing, and comparing the probability of malicious and normal nodes participating in consensus. Third, system implementation and testing. By comparing the difference in consensus latency between DPoS and the improved C-DPoS, it is concluded that C-DPoS has a greater operational speed advantage over DPoS. The implementation of the C-DPoS consensus algorithm can further ensure that blockchain-based result trading and knowledge sharing can operate stably. According to the Law on Promoting the Transformation of Scientific and Technological Achievements (2015 revised version), the transformation of scientific and technological achievements of universities refers to the activities of subsequent testing, development, application, and promotion of scientific and technological achievements until the formation of new technologies, new processes, new materials, and new products and the development of new industries to improve the productivity level. Through the development of the transformation management system of scientific and technological achievements, the research data can be summarised in real time and comprehensively, and the blockchain can be used to achieve data protection, which has the characteristics of comprehensive management functions and strong security and effectively improves the efficiency and information security of the transformation of scientific and technological achievements.	
1253	实体经济	Antecedents of Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platforms (BEEP) adoption by customers-A study of second-hand small and medium apparel retailers	Increasingly, the apparel industry generates enormous waste and pollution causing extreme water scarcity in emerging economies, where circular economy (CE) adoption can help to alleviate these pressing issues of this century. Environmentally conscious consumers gradually switch to purchasing secondhand clothes, prompting apparel companies to reposition their brands on sustainability dimensions. Nevertheless, buying secondhand apparel comes with a risk of counterfeiting and authenticity of the products. Blockchain can be an effective technology for tracking and tracing the products to their origin if effectively implemented in the apparel industry. In this study, we identify and analyze the antecedents to Blockchain-Enabled E-commerce Platform (BEEP) adoption in secondhand apparel retailing. We conducted a survey of Indian female consumers using the theoretical constructs of consumer's buying motives and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results show that buying motives (namely economic motives, hedonic motives and critical motives) and UTAUT constructs (viz. performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and attitude) explain BEEP acceptance for secondhand apparel shopping. Risk of contamination increases BEEP adoption intention and also mediates the relationship between fashion motives and intention. Blockchain technology promotes behavioral intention towards online second-hand fashion clothing shopping, and by so doing reduces waste and promotes CE.	blockchain;digital platform;circular economy (ce);secondhand apparel retailing;sustainability;consumers;emerging economyinformation-technology;user acceptance;unified theory;consumer perceptions;banking adoption;vintage fashion;consumption;model;sustainability;collaboration
1254	实体经济	A Business-to-Business Collaboration System That Promotes Data Utilization While Encrypting Information on the Blockchain	Ensuring the reliability of data gathering from every connected device is an essential issue for promoting the advancement of the next paradigm shift, i.e., Industry 4.0. Blockchain technology is becoming recognized as an advanced tool. However, data collaboration using blockchain has not progressed sufficiently among companies in the industrial supply chain (SC) that handle sensitive data, such as those related to product quality, etc. There are two reasons why data utilization is not sufficiently advanced in the industrial SC. The first is that manufacturing information is top secret. Blockchain mechanisms, such as Bitcoin, which uses PKI, require plaintext to be shared between companies to verify the identity of the company that sent the data. Another is that the merits of data collaboration between companies have not been materialized. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a business-to-business collaboration system using homomorphic encryption and blockchain techniques. Using the proposed system, each company can exchange encrypted confidential information and utilize the data for its own business. In a trial, an equipment manufacturer was able to identify the quality change caused by a decrease in equipment performance as a cryptographic value from blockchain and to identify the change one month earlier without knowing the quality value.	business-to-business data collaboration;industrial supply chain;blockchain;homomorphic encryptioninternet;things

The results show that the technical features of blockchain can solve the painful problems of copyright risk, algorithmic black box, and weak trust mechanism in the media industry, and the combination of the two can form a new burst of media productivity. The article discusses the broad application prospects of blockchain in the media industry, which is essential for big data and blockchain research. This paper composes the pioneering literature on the blockchain, catches the information on blockchain by keywords, analyzes the application prospect of blockchain in the media industry, and promotes the research and application of blockchain technology.	
1256	协同技术	A decentralized secured grid integration system using APEBC technique with multi access AI framework	Now days huge amounts of outsourced data are done especially in the cloud based amenities. Providing data confidentiality and data security on cloud data are the important key factors. Generally, data stored on cloud in the encrypted format. Based on the user demand for accessing data from the cloud server, a retrieving key is issued through the third party is mandatory. Here, the data security is depending on the third party. If the third party is not genuine, then the data security is questionable. Based on this issue, the novel based cloud storage mechanism with accessing governor using Authenticated Privacy Ethereum based Blockchain (APEBC) technique is proposed. This technique is based on Encoded Policy Attribute Based Encrypted embedded with Ethereum concept. The third party concept is not necessary in this proposed work as it is based on decentralized. The ethereum based blockchain technique allows the end user to set legal access periods. So, the end users can access and decrypt their data during on that access periods alone. The details of settings the legal access periods and tracking the access duration are stored and processed with the blockchain technique. Finally, the proposed work is implemented and examined based on the security standards. The demonstration shows that the proposed work is feasible in all aspects.	soft computing;grid integration system;energy storage systems;blockchain;cloud computing;fault detection;cp-abenetwork
1257	市场治理	Bitcoin price evolution versus energy consumption; trend analysis	Digital technology developments shape the behaviour, performances, standards of society, organizations and individuals imposing new ways of payments and new forms of money. In this environment in 2008 was developed a new type of currency, namely Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency, as this new form of money has been generically called, puts pressure on the traditional concept of money. Today, the economic value of cryptocurrencies is attested by their circulation and acceptance by user communities for trade. However, establishing this value raises debates in the literature. The research from this paper investigates and analyses if there is a strong enough connectedness between Bitcoin price evolution and energy consumption tendency (for mining), to influence Bitcoin value. Public data from January 2014 to July 2021 is used. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to study and predict the tendency of Bitcoin price and energy consumption. A comparison between the forecasting trend and the real trend (the evolution of energy consumption and Bitcoin price) was made. The conducted research starts with a quantitative one and ends with a qualitative one (trends). The obtained results show that qualitatively, there is a good correlation between monthly average values of BTC prices and electricity consumption for mining.	cryptocurrency;bitcoin;blockchain;artificial neural network (ann);energy consumptionnetworks;markets;garch
1258	市场治理	A two level ensemble classification approach to forecast bitcoin prices	Purpose Bitcoin has indeed been universally acknowledged as an investment asset in recent decades, after the boom-and-bust of cryptocurrency values. Because of its extreme volatility, it requires accurate forecasts to build economic decisions. Although prior research has utilized machine learning to improve Bitcoin price prediction accuracy, few have looked into the plausibility of using multiple modeling approaches on datasets containing varying data types and volumetric attributes. Thus, this paper aims to propose a bitcoin price prediction model. Design/methodology/approach In this research work, a bitcoin price prediction model is introduced by following three major phases: Data collection, feature extraction and price prediction. Initially, the collected Bitcoin time-series data will be preprocessed and the original features will be extracted. To make this work good-fit with a high level of accuracy, we have been extracting the second order technical indicator based features like average true range (ATR), modified-exponential moving average (M-EMA), relative strength index and rate of change and proposed decomposed inter-day difference. Subsequently, these extracted features along with the original features will be subjected to prediction phase, where the prediction of bitcoin price value is attained precisely from the constructed two-level ensemble classifier. The two-level ensemble classifier will be the amalgamation of two fabulous classifiers: optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long/short-term memory (BiLSTM). To cope up with the volatility characteristics of bitcoin prices, it is planned to fine-tune the weight parameter of CNN by a new hybrid optimization model. The proposed hybrid optimization model referred as black widow updated rain optimization (BWURO) model will be conceptual blended of rain optimization algorithm and black widow optimization algorithm. Findings The proposed work is compared over the existing models in terms of convergence, MAE, MAPE, MARE, MSE, MSPE, MRSE, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), RMSPE and RMSRE, respectively. These evaluations have been conducted for both algorithmic performance as well as classifier performance. At LP = 50, the MAE of the proposed work is 0.023372, which is 59.8%, 72.2%, 62.14% and 64.08% better than BWURO + Bi-LSTM, CNN + BWURO, NN + BWURO and SVM + BWURO, respectively. Originality/value In this research work, a new modified EMA feature is extracted, which makes the bitcoin price prediction more efficient. In this research work, a two-level ensemble classifier is constructed in the price prediction phase by blending the Bi-LSTM and optimized CNN, respectively. To deal with the volatility of bitcoin values, a novel hybrid optimization model is used to fine-tune the weight parameter of CNN.	bitcoin;price prediction;proposed second order technical indicator (soti);m-ema;bwuroneural-networks;prediction;blockchain;model
1259	市场治理	Bubbles and crashes in cryptocurrencies: Interdependence, contagion, or asset rotation?	Using a quantile vector autoregressive model to capture return dynamics in extreme market conditions, we find that the cryptocurrency market exhibits a high level of market connectedness. Bitcoin is a net transmitter of return spillovers during busts and a net receiver during booms. Analysis of the timing of bubble and crash periods uncovers the presence of interdependence and contagion effects. Asset dynamics is driven to a great extent by the technology, in particular the consensus protocol of cryptocurrencies. There is only limited evidence for asset rotation, and it involves mostly Ripple.	cryptocurrencies;interdependence;contagion;rotation;bubbles;crashesconnectedness;market;returns;bitcoin
1260	平台项目	Need for speed, but how much does it cost? Unpacking the fee-speed relationship in Bitcoin transactions	The growing popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is driven by the flexibility in transaction fee offerings, among other factors. To achieve service-level differentiation among their users, many cryptocurrencies allow users to "name your own price," giving rise to a large variation in fee offerings and hence, variation in confirmation times. Yet, the time it takes a cryptocurrency transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain is not only affected by the fee offered, but also by the contemporaneous congestion level and the inherent randomness in the verification process. Although it is generally expected that higher fees lead to quicker confirmation, the uniqueness of the cryptocurrency setting adds important nuances to the fee-speed relationship. Using Bitcoin-the original and most heavily used cryptocurrency by far-as our empirical context, we stylize the transaction confirmation processes, propose a theoretical framework that maps the causal path from fee to speed, and estimate this framework using Bitcoin transaction data under periods of high volatility. Our results show strong evidence for two characteristics of fee's impact: congestion dependence and tail shrinkage. Our finding that the speed acceleration effect of fee is particularly strong on the tail of the confirmation time distribution motivates a target service level approach to fee recommendation. To put this finding into practice, we develop an efficient computational procedure that helps Bitcoin users accurately estimate fees based on their confirmation delay preferences. We discuss the implications of our analyses on future cryptocurrency development and the long-term adoption of this revolutionary technology.	blockchain;congested service system;cryptocurrency;name your own price;pay what you want;priority queues;service fee;service speedprice;service;want;pay;operations;models;impact;name;endogeneity;markets
1261	市场治理	Monetary policy shocks and Bitcoin prices	This paper investigates the impact of US monetary policy shocks on Bitcoin prices. On the day of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a hypothetical unexpected monetary tightening by 1 basis point of two-year Treasury yield is associated with a 0.25% drop in the price of Bitcoin, comparable in magnitude to the effect on the gold price. The cumulative effect is much stronger in the next few days following the FOMC meeting. Impulse response analysis shows that this effect is very persistent. According to quantile regression, monetary policy surprises have a greater impact on Bitcoin prices during a market boom.	monetary policy;bitcoin;impulse response analysis;quantile regressionfederal-reserve;interest-rates;safe haven;inefficiency;gold;cryptocurrency;volatility;responses;dollar;impact

Specifically, we examine the presence of reduction in downside risk after mixing gold/Bitcoin with such energy commodities. To do this, we account for dependence among energy commodities and gold/Bitcoin returns by applying a (vine) copula. The findings show that gold substantially reduces the downside risk of a portfolio containing any allocation to gold and energy commodities, indicating its safe-haven ability. In contrast, Bitcoin's safe-haven functionality is inconsistent since the downside risk reduction is achieved for Bitcoin's small allocation only.	bitcoin;covid-19;gold;downside risk;safe haven;vine copuladownside risk;hedge;price;stocks

Moreover, this research applied the VAR (1)-GARCH (1, 1) model to investigate the spillover effect from the stock market to Bitcoin. According to the findings, the shocks from the stock market also influenced Bitcoin's volatility during COVID-19 and other periods of turmoil.	bitcoin;uncertainty;conditional variance;covid-19;safe-havenhedge
1264	市场治理	An analysis of investors' behavior in Bitcoin market	As an emerging digital asset, Bitcoin has been traded for more than a decade, reaching an impressively high market capitalization and continuing to expand its volume of trading at a rapid pace. Many countries have legalized or are considering legalizing a trading platform for this asset, and a set of companies worldwide accept it as a medium of exchange. As a result of this expansion, many studies in finance literature have focused on studying the efficiency of this cryptocurrency. In line with this literature, this paper investigates, using the abnormal returns and abnormal trading volumes methodologies, the dynamics of investors' reaction to the arrival of unexpected favorable and unfavorable information regarding the Bitcoin market in the context of the three famous hypotheses: the overreaction, the uncertain information, and the efficient market hypotheses. Overall, we find evidence confirming that the Bitcoin market tends to mature over time. More precisely, over the entire analyzed period, investors behave in accordance with the predictions of the uncertain information hypothesis when positive and negative events occur. However, splitting the timespan into sub-periods provides interesting insights. Remarkably in this respect is the fact that starting with the second sub-period, the response of investors in the Bitcoin market supports, in a moderate manner, the postulate of the efficient market hypothesis when favorable events are addressed. Moreover, our findings reveal that during the pandemic period, the efficiency of Bitcoin has increased, thus turning this stressful period into an advantage for this cryptocurrency. This improved market efficiency is also supported by the abnormal trading volume analysis.	price overreactions;trading volume;inefficiency;information;event;returns;impact
1265	市场治理	Cryptocurrency Forecasting: More Evidence of the Meese-Rogoff Puzzle	This paper tests the random walk hypothesis in the cryptocurrency market. Based on the well-known Meese-Rogoff puzzle, we evaluate whether cryptocurrency returns are predictable or not. For this purpose, we conduct in-sample and out-of-sample analyses to examine the forecasting power of our model built with autoregressive components and lagged returns of BITCOIN, compared with the random walk benchmark. To this end, we considered the 13 major cryptocurrencies between 2018 and 2022. Our results indicate that our models significantly outperform the random walk benchmark. In particular, cryptocurrencies tend to be far more persistent than regular exchange rates, and BITCOIN (BTC) seems to improve the predictive accuracy of our models for some cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, while the predictive performance is time varying, we find predictive ability in different regimes before and during the pandemic crisis. We think that these results are helpful to policymakers and investors because they open a new perspective on cryptocurrency investing strategies and regulations to improve financial stability.	cryptocurrency forecasting;blockchain investors;investment in cryptocurrencies;random walk;out-of-sample analysis;exchange rates;univariate time seriesexchange-rate models;predictive accuracy;equity premium;random-walk;bitcoin;tests;rates;returns;predictability;volatility
1266	实体经济	Application of Distributed Ledger Technology in Distribution Networks	In the transition to a society with net-zero carbon emissions, high penetration of distributed renewable power generation and large-scale electrification of transportation and heat are driving the conventional distribution network operators (DNOs) to evolve into distribution system operators (DSOs) that manage distribution networks in a more active and flexible way. As a radical decentralized data management technology, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has the potential to support a trustworthy digital infrastructure facilitating the DNO-DSO transition. Based on a comprehensive review of worldwide research and practice, as well as the engagement of relevant industrial experts, the application of DLT in distribution networks is identified and analyzed in this article. The DLT features and DSO needs are first summarized, and the mapping relationship between them is identified. Detailed DSO functions are identified and classified into five categories (i.e.", planning", "operation", "market", "asset", and "connection") with the potential of applying DLT to various DSO functions assessed. Finally, the development of seven key DSO functions with high DLT potential is analyzed and discussed from the technical, legal, and social perspectives, including peer-to-peer energy trading, flexibility market facilitation, electric vehicle charging, network pricing, distributed generation register, data access, and investment planning.	distributed ledger;distribution networks;consensus protocol;scalability;bitcoin;electric potential;smart contracts;blockchain;distributed ledger technology (dlt);distribution network;smart contract;smart gridblockchain technology;energy;reliability;challenges;management;vehicle;system
1267	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Peer-to-Peer Transactive Energy Management Scheme for Smart Grid System	In Smart Grid (SG), Transactive Energy Management (TEM) is one of the most promising approaches to boost consumer participation in energy generation, energy management, and establishing decentralized energy market models using Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2P, a prosumer produces electric energy at their place using Renewable Energy Resources (RES) such as solar energy, wind energy, etc. Then, this generated energy is traded with consumers (who need the energy) in a nearby locality. P2P facilitates energy exchange in localized micro-energy markets of the TEM system. Such decentralized P2P energy management could cater to diverse prosumers and utility business models. However, the existing P2P approaches suffer from several issues such as single-point-of-failure, network bandwidth, scalability, trust, and security issues. To handle the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a Decentralized and Transparent P2P Energy Trading (DT-P2PET) scheme using blockchain. The proposed DT-P2PET scheme aims to reduce the grid's energy generation and management burden while also increasing profit for both consumers and prosumers through a dynamic pricing mechanism. The DT-P2PET scheme uses Ethereum-blockchain-based Smart Contracts (SCs) and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for the P2P energy trading. Furthermore, a recommender mechanism is also introduced in this study to increase the number of prosumers. The Ethereum SCs are designed and deployed to perform P2P in real time in the proposed DT-P2PET scheme. The DT-P2PET scheme is evaluated based on the various parameters such as profit generation (for prosumer and consumer both), data storage cost, network bandwidth, and data transfer rate in contrast to the existing approaches.	blockchain;smart grid;transactive energy management;peer-to-peer energy trading;ethereumdata analytics
1268	实体经济	Personal Mobility in Metaverse With Autonomous Vehicles Using Q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Sets Based OPA-RAFSI Model	The term metaverse, which shows a 3D-designed virtual medium where people can connect through their avatars to spend time, telecommute, and socialize, has entered our lives fast. There are limitless implementations that can take place in the metaverse. Integration of another technological innovation, which is autonomous vehicles to the metaverse, is at hand. There are numerous alternative uses of autonomous vehicles in the metaverse. In this study, three alternative implementation options for autonomous vehicles in the metaverse are investigated. These alternatives are evaluated using the proposed multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method under twelve different criteria, which are grouped under four main aspects, namely technological, societal, legal and ethical, and transportation. A novel hybrid model based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) which consists of three stages is presented to express the framework definition, calculate the weight coefficients of the criteria, and rank various alternatives. In the first stage, the structure of the problem is created. In the second stage, q-ROFSs based OPA algorithm is used to calculate the weights of the criteria. In the last stage, q-ROFSs based RAFSI (Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval) is applied to choose the best alternative among the three alternatives. Finally, we present a case study to verify our proposed method. The results of this study have the potential to be used as a guide by decision-makers of the metaverse while integrating autonomous vehicles into the transportation system.	metaverse;autonomous vehicles;decision making;costs;avatars;safety;fuzzy sets;metaverse;autonomous vehicles;personal mobility;fuzzy sets;multi-criteria decision-making;q-rofs;opa

In this work, we propose a transaction manager for ontology-based database manipulation that combines blockchain and Semantic Web technologies. The latter is used for the efficient querying and modification of data, whereas the blockchain is used for the secure storage and tracking of changes. The blockchain enables a decentralized setup and data restoration. We evaluate our solution by measuring cost and time. Our solution introduces some overhead for updates whereas querying works at the same speed as the underlying ontology database.	semantic web;blockchain;ontologies;databases;ipfs;ethereumsemantic web
1271	虚拟经济	Trust in blockchain-enabled exchanges: Future directions in blockchain marketing	Prior research typically positions blockchain technology as enabling a trustless exchange environment without specifically investigating how blockchain technology provides trust and what makes the data in a blockchain "tamperproof" and "immutable." This article serves to address these research gaps by conducting semi-structured interviews with 18 informants who have had at least three years of project experience with blockchain-enabled exchanges. Our findings uncover three unique aspects of blockchain that enable trust in exchange vs. a traditional exchange: (1) trust in exchange actors: mathematics and cryptography vs. human guardians within institutions, (2) trust in exchange actions: information transparency enabling tamperproof and immutable data vs. information asymmetry, and (3) trust in exchange assets: digital vs. manual escrows for verifying ownership of valuable goods. This research is vital for marketing scholars and practitioners who seek to understand the rise of threats to trust regarding online advertising, customer trust, privacy, and digital rights.	trust;business relationships;nfts;metaverse;online advertising;privacy;exchangetechnology;framework;privacy;impact;governance;dynamics;benefits;ledger;choice;cost
1272	核心技术	The Value of Smart Contract in Trade Finance	Problem definition: Smart contract improves the supply chain efficiency by enabling the supplier's commitment to postshipment financing decisions, which mitigates the bank's lending risk exposure and thereby reduces the financing cost. This paper investigates how smart contract adoption could facilitate trade finance activities and create value for supply chain firms. Academic/practical relevance: As the emerging blockchain technology could potentially reshape the trade financing landscape, understanding the impact of smart contract adoption and its interaction with trade finance activities is practically relevant and of great importance. Methodology: We develop a two-stage game-theoretic model and adopt supply chain finance theory to characterize the strategic interactions between supply chain firms in the presence of both operational risk (demand uncertainty) and financial risks (credit and liquidity risks). Results: We find that the value of smart contract depends critically on the trade finance structures, including both preshipment and postshipment financing schemes. Under the baseline trade finance model (with purchase order financing as preshipment financing and factoring as postshipment financing), smart contract alleviates the supplier's overpricing behavior caused by commitment frictions and helps restore the supply chain efficiency. When buyer direct financing serves as an alternative preshipment financing, smart contract might discourage the retailer from offering buyer direct financing, which significantly hurts the supplier and thus reduces the supply chain profit. When invoice trading serves as the alternative postshipment financing, the supplier always chooses invoice trading over factoring because of its trading flexibility, which in turn, makes the commitment frictions ubiquitous and unresolvable (namely, commitment trap). As a result, invoice trading could unexpectedly lead to a lower supplier's profit. Luckily, such an adoption dilemma can be resolved by smart contract adoption in conjunction with factoring. Managerial implications: Our findings provide guidelines for and insights into when smart contract should be adopted and its interactions with different trade finance schemes. In particular, smart contract adoption does not always benefit the supply chain.	trade finance;supply chain finance;fintech;smart contract;purchase order financing;buyer direct financing;factoring;invoice tradingincomplete contracts;vs. bank;credit;suppliers;inventory

It is considered to have great potential to promote health in the forms of art, architecture, landscape, space, and environment. However, there are insufficient design approaches to address the challenges during the HTD process. An increased number of studies have shown that emerging information modeling (IM) such as building information modeling (BIM), landscape information modeling (LIM), and city information modeling (CIM) coupled with blockchain (BC) functionalities have the potential to enhance designers' HTD by considering important design elements, namely design variables, design knowledge, and design decision. It can also address challenges during the design process, such as design changes, conflicts in design requirements, the lack of design evaluation tools and frameworks, and incomplete design information. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a conceptual BC enhanced IM for HTD (BC-HTD) framework that addresses the challenges in the HTD and promotes health and well-being. The structure of BC-HTD framework is twofold: (1) a conceptual high-level framework comprising three levels: user; system; and information, (2) a conceptual low-level framework of detailed content at the system level, which has been constructed using a mixed quantitative and qualitative method of literature analysis, and validated via a pre-interview questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews with industry experts and academics. This paper analyzes the process of BC enhanced HTD and the knowledge management of HTD to aid design decisions in managing design information. This paper is the first attempt to apply the advantages of BC enabled IM to enhance the HTD process. The results of this study can foster and propel new research pathways and knowledge on the value of design in the form of non-fungible token (NFT) based on the extended advantages of BC in the field of design, which can fully mobilize the healing and therapeutic behaviors of designers and the advantage potential of HTD to promote health, and realize the vision of Health Metaverse in the context of sustainable development.	healing and therapeutic design;blockchain;building information modeling (bim);landscape information modeling (lim);city information modeling (cim);art therapy;mental health;sustainable development;non-fungible token (nft);health metaverseart;environments;impact;dementia;covid-19;benefits;creation;adults

A penalized regression approach	We investigate which factors contribute most to the liquidity of Bitcoin, using a diverse universe of candidate factors reflecting key developments in the crypto market and the global economy. The empirical analysis relies on three regularized linear regression methods, viz. LASSO, adaptive LASSO, and elastic net. We also apply a cross-fit partialing-out LASSO instrumental-variables regression model, as a supplementary approach to handle endogeneity. Findings reveal that trading volume and realized volatility of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency hacks, Ethereum liquidity, and public attention are the most common drivers of liquidity, irrespective of the penalized regression approach and liquidity proxy adopted. Our evidence confirms the paramountcy of cryptocurrency-specific factors over global economic and financial ones in influencing Bitcoin liquidity.	bitcoin;liquidity determinants;lasso;adaptive lasso;elastic netpost-regularization inference;bid-ask spreads;variable selection;linear-models;interdependence
1277	法律治理	Stolen billions from errant mouse clicks: Crypto requires new approaches to attack money-laundering	There are two camps regarding bitcoin and other so-called "digital assets." One side sees any cryptocurrency as a financial utopia: an egalitarian technology free from centralized monetary authorities. The other sees this same technology as merely a novel mechanism for enabling more crime, corruption, and money laundering. Both positions contain an element of truth, but both share a common misapprehension: They assume that digital assets are beyond the reach of law enforcement and regulatory agencies - which is decidedly not the case, at least for now. But the digital asset economy evolves rapidly. To stay ahead of the curve, authorities will need to adapt existing rules and regulations about money-laundering, sanctions, and sending funds to rogue states - tools originally designed for an entirely different financial infrastructure - to mitigate threats to the financial system posed by virtual assets.	bitcoin;blockchain;digital assets;financial asset;regulation;central bank digital currencies;north korea
1278	法律治理	Financial Risk Evaluation of Digital Currency Based on CART Algorithm Blockchain	In recent years, digital currencies based on blockchain technology have brought about a boom in the research of encrypted digital currencies with the design concept of peer-to-peer trading and decentralization, but due to the lack of supervision and obvious speculative characteristics of the digital currency market, the sharp fluctuations in the market can easily trigger investor sentiment fluctuations, which in turn will lead to social instability and even financial system risks. In this paper, through the analysis of the financial risk source factors of blockchain digital currency, the evaluation index is established, the risk evaluation index system is constructed, and then the CART classification algorithm is used to analyze it and evaluate and test the model. The characteristic factor structure obtained by the CART algorithm in this paper better explains the financial risk characteristics of blockchain digital currency and gives relatively reliable identification results. The results show that the CART decision tree classification method is effective and has a high accuracy rate, which classifies the financial risks of blockchain digital currency, and the method has excellent adaptability and matchability for the classification of risk problems.

1280	核心技术	Distributed storage scheme for encryption speech data based on blockchain and IPFS	Traditional centralized cloud storage has difficulties in realizing the secure storage and sharing of speech and other multimedia data, as well as realizing fine-grained access control and privacy protection for speech data. To address this problem, we propose a distributed storage scheme for encryption speech data based on blockchain and inter planetary file system (IPFS). Our scheme is based on the characteristics of blockchain anti-tampering, decentralization and traceability. It is designed to ensure the security and controllability of private sensitive speech data of data users without the use of centralized cloud storage architecture. First, the ciphertext policy hierarchical attribute-based encryption (CP-HABE) scheme is used to encrypt the speech data. The encrypted speech data is then stored in the IPFS to achieve distributed storage. Second, a distributed and trusted access control policy is implemented by deploying an access control protocol Ethereum smart contract related to speech attributes. Finally, the proposed scheme is deployed and tested in the Linux environment, and the smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum test chain. Through experimental comparison with different storage schemes, analysis of the operational properties of our scheme and the evaluation of the quality index of the encryption scheme, the proposed scheme is shown to reliable, secure and scalable.	distributed storage;blockchain;interplanetary file system;smart contract;speech data;ciphertext policy hierarchical attribute-based encryption
1281	虚拟经济	A preliminary assessment of the performance of DeFi cryptocurrencies in relation to other financial assets, volatility, and user-generated content	After the so-called "crypto-winter", decentralised finance (DeFi) is reviving interest in cryptocurrency amongst the scientific community, public and private institutions, and investors. DeFi is a novel disruptive process that promotes the use of blockchain technology for creating and issuing all kinds of financial products and services. This study aimed to measure the relationship amongst the returns of DeFi tokens, other traditional assets, and user-generated content. While the relationship between other crypto assets and traditional assets has been researched, this has not been done on DeFi assets. This study uses a logit-probit model over a database comprising the daily returns of 13 DeFi, VIX, S&P GSCI Crude Oil Index, and S&P GSCI Gold Index, and the daily variation in DeFi mentions in Telegram chats and Twitter. The results show that all variables except the S&P GSCI crude oil index returns and the daily variation in Twitter mentions were significant. This suggests that DeFi acts, similar to other crypto assets, as a safe haven. This study contributes to the literature on decentralised finance tokens as investment assets, which requires much more research.	defi;decentralized finance;blockchain;cryptocurrencies;user-generated contenttoken sales;bitcoin;oil;gold;fear

1283	核心技术	Design of a Blockchain-Based Service Platform for Industrial Interconnection Supply and Demand Networks	With the continuous cross-border cooperation among industries, the concept of an industrial interconnection supply and demand network is constantly mentioned. As industry interconnectivity continues to grow, collaboration models have changed as companies work more closely with each other, and the synergy model has changed. In order to improve the efficiency of collaboration and to promote the free allocation of resources in the trading process of the industry interconnection supply and demand network, an industry interconnection supply and demand network resource matching platform based on the Alliance blockchain was built, steps for resource trading on the platform were proposed. Using blockchain technology's smart contract technology to simplify the transaction process, the triggering mechanism and algorithm rules of smart contracts in the trading process of the platform were designed, and the smart contract code was developed, deployed, and tested using Remix IDE, and the test results showed the transaction process between the supply and demand sides. Through blockchain technology, it achieves information security and transparency in the process of resource trading in the industry interconnection supply and demand network, establishes a trust mechanism on both sides of the transaction, reduces redundant steps in the transaction and improves the operational efficiency of the industry interconnection supply and demand network by increasing the efficiency of resource allocation.	supply and demand network;smart contracts;synergy
1284	核心技术	A Sentiment Analysis Method Based on a Blockchain-Supported Long Short-Term Memory Deep Network	Traditional sentiment analysis methods are based on text-, visual- or audio-processing using different machine learning and/or deep learning architecture, depending on the data type. This situation comes with technical processing diversity and cultural temperament effect on analysis of the results, which means the results can change according to the cultural diversities. This study integrates a blockchain layer with an LSTM architecture. This approach can be regarded as a machine learning application that enables the transfer of the metadata of the ledger to the learning database by establishing a cryptographic connection, which is created by adding the next sentiment with the same value to the ledger as a smart contract. Thus, a "Proof of Learning" consensus blockchain layer integrity framework, which constitutes the confirmation mechanism of the machine learning process and handles data management, is provided. The proposed method is applied to a Twitter dataset with the emotions of negative, neutral and positive. Previous sentiment analysis methods on the same data achieved accuracy rates of 14% in a specific culture and 63% in a the culture that has appealed to a wider audience in the past. This study puts forth a very promising improvement by increasing the accuracy to 92.85%.	sentiment analysis;blockchain;smart contracts;machine learning
1285	市场治理	Dynamics of the sheltering role of Bitcoin against crude oil market crash with varying severity of the COVID-19: A comparison with gold	This paper studies evolution of the asymmetric sheltering role of Bitcoin compared to gold against oil-related uncertainties with varying severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a varying-coefficient quantile approach, we find a safe haven role of Bitcoin, and it becomes gradually stronger when the pandemic intensifies. The relationship between gold and oil markets is shown to vary with changing severity of the pandemic. We find that gold acts as an increasingly weakened diversifier as the pandemic intensifies until a level, above which its diversification gains would dissipate then. In normal market conditions, both Bitcoin and gold perform as weak hedges for oil portfolios. Our findings demonstrate that interpretation of the sheltering role of Bitcoin and gold against oil market downturns would be biased unless the role dynamics in different market conditions and pandemic severity are considered. Additional analyses reassure robustness of our findings.	bitcoin;crude oil market;covid-19 pandemic;safe haven;gold;varying-coefficient quantile regressionsafe-haven;precious metals;hedge;diversifier;investment;inflation;returns;stocks;bonds

Conversely, UCRY Policy positively impacts gold, DJ Islamic Index, and Sukuk returns, highlighting their potential to function as a hedge or safe-haven asset.

Furthermore, we employed a novel Granger causality methodology with a Fourier approximation to determine the relationship between herding and volatility, considering the structural breaks.

Inspired by cross-market information flows among international stock markets, we incorporate external predictive information from other cryptocurrency markets to forecast the realized volatility (RV) of Bitcoin. To make the most of such external information, we employ six widely accepted approaches to construct predictive models based on multivariate information. Our results suggest that the scaled principal component analysis (SPCA) approach steadily improves the predictive ability of the prevailing heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) benchmark model considering both the model confidence set (MCS) test and the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test based on three widely accepted loss functions. The forecasting performance is persistent to various robustness checks and extensions. Notably, a mean-variance investor can obtain steady positive economic gains if the investment portfolio is constructed on the basis of the forecasts from the HAR-SPCA model. The results of this study show that external predictive information is statistically and economically important in forecasting Bitcoin RV.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;realized volatility;out-of-sample prediction;scaled principal component analysisstock return predictability;equity premium prediction;crude-oil prices;market volatility;anything beat;combination;model;shrinkage;selection;tests

1291	市场治理	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF BITCOIN RETURN?S VOLATILITY	This paper mainly studies the market nonlinearity and the prediction model based on the intrinsic generation mechanism (chaos) of Bitcoin???s daily return???s volatility from June 27, 2013 to November 7, 2019 with an econophysics perspective, so as to avoid the forecasting model misspecification. Firstly, this paper studies the multifractal and chaotic nonlinear characteristics of Bitcoin volatility by using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) methods. Then, from the perspective of nonlinearity, the measured values of multifractal and chaos show that the volatility of Bitcoin has short-term predictability. The study of chaos and multifractal dynamics in nonlinear systems is very important in terms of their predictability. The chaos signals may have short-term predictability, while multifractals and self-similarity can increase the likelihood of accurately predicting future sequences of these signals. Finally, we constructed a number of chaotic artificial neural network models to forecast the Bitcoin return???s volatility avoiding the model misspecification. The results show that chaotic artificial neural network models have good prediction effect by comparing these models with the existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. This is because the chaotic artificial neural network models can extract hidden patterns and accurately model time series from potential signals, while the benchmark ANN models are based on Gaussian kernel local approximation of non-stationary signals, so they cannot approach the global model with chaotic characteristics. At the same time, the multifractal parameters are further mined to obtain more market information to guide financial practice. These above findings matter for investors (especially for investors in quantitative trading) as well as effective supervision of financial institutions by government.	nonlinear;multifractal;chaos;bitcoin;predictionlyapunov exponents;safe haven;market;chaos;diversification;inefficiency;efficiency;liquidity;network;garch

Using a quantile vector autoregressive model to capture return dynamics in extreme market conditions, we find that the cryptocurrency market exhibits a high level of market connectedness.

Analysis of the timing of bubble and crash periods uncovers the presence of interdependence and contagion effects.

Moreover, this paper finds two significant network factors in explaining the return of cryptocurrencies. Specifically, the risk contagion occurs under extreme market conditions, while the network diversification happens only when the market is under distress. Further sub-market analysis finds that cryptocurrencies are impacted more than stocks by the massive selloff during bear markets.	cryptocurrency;covar;network;adjacency matrix;risk spillover;systemic risksafe-haven;bitcoin;connectedness;volatility;risk;integration;dependence;spillover;returns;garch

1297	市场治理	A Large-Scale Bitcoin Abuse Measurement and Clustering Analysis Utilizing Public Reports	Cryptocurrency abuse has become a critical problem. Due to the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency, criminals commonly adopt cryptocurrency for trading drugs and deceiving people without revealing their identities. Despite its significance and severity, only few works have studied how cryptocurrency has been abused in the real world, and they only provide some limited measurement results. Thus, to provide a more in-depth understanding on the cryptocurrency abuse cases, we present a large-scale analysis on various Bitcoin abuse types using 200,507 realworld reports collected by victims from 214 countries. We scrutinize observable abuse trends, which are closely related to real-world incidents, to understand the causality of the abuses. Furthermore, we investigate the semantics of various cryptocurrency abuse types to show that several abuse types overlap in meaning and to provide valuable insight into the public dataset. In addition, we delve into abuse channels to identify which widely-known platforms can be maliciously deployed by abusers following the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Consequently, we demonstrate the polarization property of Bitcoin addresses practically utilized on transactions, and confirm the possible usage of public report data for providing clues to track cyber threats. We expect that this research on Bitcoin abuse can empirically reach victims more effectively than cybercrime, which is subject to professional investigation.	bitcoin abuse;clustering;cryptocurrency;cyber crime;cyber threat intelligence;public data
1298	核心技术	On Increasing Scalability and Liquidation of Lightning Networks for Blockchains	The lightning network (LN) is a layer-two solution in Bitcoin for support scalability. LN uses offchain micropayment channels to scale the blockchain's capability to perform instant transactions without a global block confirmation process. However, micropayment scalability in a large LN is still limited by its relatively large searching space for a suitable route. Liquidation for small nodes still remains major challenges for the LN as the amount of transactions along a channel is predetermined by the channel capacity defined by two end nodes of the channel. In this paper, we introduce the notion of supernodes and the corresponding supernodes-based pooling to address these challenges. In order to meet the high adaptivity and low maintenance cost in the dynamic LN where users join and leave, supernodes are constructed locally to avoid global information or label propagation. Each supernode, together with a subset of (non-supernodes) neighbors, forms a supernode-based pool. These pools constitute a partition of the LN. Additionally, supernodes are self-connected. Micropayment scalability is supported through node set reduction as only supernodes are involved in searching and in payment with other supernodes. Liquidation is enhanced through pooling to redistribute funds within a pool to external channels of its supernode. Extensive simulations using LN simulator CLoTH have been conducted to validate the improvement in routing scalability and liquidation of the proposed architecture under different settings.	blockchains;scalability;routing;channel capacity;lightning;color;bitcoin;bitcoin;blockchain;lightning networks;liquidation;localized algorithms;pooling;scalability;supernodeschain
1299	虚拟经济	A blockchain-based secure storage and access control scheme for supply chain finance	Supply chain finance (SCF) provides credit for small and medium-sized enterprises with low credit lines and small financing scales. The resulting financial credit data and related business transaction data are highly confidential and private. However, traditional SCF management schemes use third-party platforms and centralized designs that cannot achieve highly reliable secure storage and fine-grained access control. To address such a need, we propose Fabric-SCF, designing and implementing a Blockchain-based secure storage system by utilizing distributed consensus to realize data security, traceability, and immutability. The attribute-based access control model is deployed for access control, also utilizing smart contracts to define system processes and access policies to ensure the system's efficient operation. To verify the performance of Fabric-SCF, two sets of simulation experiments are designed its effectiveness. Experimental results show that Fabric-SCF achieves dynamic and fine-grained access control while maintaining high throughput in a simulated real-world operating scenario.	blockchain;smart contract;supply chain finance;abac;hyperledger fabricnetwork architecture;internet;management;model
1300	实体经济	LBSV: Lightweight Blockchain Security Protocol for Secure Storage and Communication in SDN-Enabled IoV	The development of modern software-defined networking (SDN) solutions brings new opportunities in Internet-of-Vehicles (IoVs). However, the autonomous nature of the vehicular environment leads to unpredictable security vulnerabilities and reliability issues. The high computation overhead and storage requirements also pose a significant challenge in message dissemination. To overcome these issues, we introduce a lightweight blockchain-based security protocol for secure communication and storage in SDN-enabled IoV, known as LBSV. The LBSV is a permissioned blockchain network that uses the proposed modified practical byzantine fault tolerance (mPBFT) consensus algorithm. Additionally, the SDN-enabled network exploits the blockchain framework and schedules different procedures. The secure message dissemination is achieved through various cryptographic functions (i.e., elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and the secure hash algorithm (SHA256)). The security analysis shows that the LBSV withstands various cyberattacks regarding message dissemination privacy. The experimental results show that LBSV provides high performance with 85% less computational cost, 55% less storage and communication overhead and 90% less consensus delay compared with state-of-the-art schemes.	blockchains;security;computer architecture;secure storage;consensus algorithm;protocols;authentication;blockchain;consensus algorithm;internet-of-vehicle (iov);software defined networking (sdn)key agreement scheme;authentication;internet;architecture;management;networking;framework;vehicles;system;things
1301	核心技术	Achieving fine-grained and flexible access control on blockchain-based data sharing for the Internet of Things	The traditional centralized data sharing systems have potential risks such as single point of failures and excessive working load on the central node. As a distributed and collaborative alternative, approaches based upon blockchain have been explored recently for Internet of Things (IoTs). However, the access from a legitimate user may be denied without the pre-defined policy and data update on the blockchain could be costly to the owners. In this paper, we first address these issues by incorporating the Accountable Subgroup Multi-Signature (ASM) algorithm into the Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC) method with Policy Smart Contract, to provide a finegrained and flexible solution. Next, we propose a policy-based Chameleon Hash algorithm that allows the data to be updated in a reliable and convenient way by the authorized users. Finally, we evaluate our work by comparing its performance with the benchmarks.

1302	核心技术	Improved PBFT Algorithm Based on Vague Sets	The traditional PBFT consensus algorithm has several limitations in the consortium blockchain environment, such as unclear selection of primary node, excessive communication times, etc. To solve these limitations, an improved consensus algorithm VS-PBFT based on vague sets was proposed. VS-PBFT has three phases: node partition, primary node selection, and global consensus. Firstly, the nodes of the whole network are partitioned using the consistent hashing-like consensus algorithm, and then the local primary node is selected by the primary node selection algorithm in each partition. The local primary nodes run the four-phase PBFT consensus algorithm to complete the global consensus. The analysis of the VS-PBFT consistency algorithm shows that the algorithm can improve the fault-tolerant rate and reduce communication complexity, and the algorithm is dynamic; that is, node can join and quit adaptively.	blockchain
1303	核心技术	Introduction of Formal Methods in Blockchain Consensus Mechanism and Its Associated Protocols	As the size of data is increasing exponentially, its security is a major concern. Emerging technology like blockchain is used to provide security to systems. Since the inception of blockchain, it has been adopted by researchers and industry both, however, it gained enormous attention after cryptocurrency. It can be defined as a means of storing information in such a way that modification and hacking the system is difficult or impossible. A blockchain is a decentralized ledger that is digital and public, consisting of records of transactions called blocks. A consensus technology assures that all nodes agree on a unique sequence for appending blocks. A comprehensive examination of these algorithms will aid in understanding how and why each blockchain operates in the manner that it does. In this study, we addressed extensively used consensus techniques in the blockchain and the importance of consensus protocol in blockchain technology. The underlying consensus algorithm is a critical component of every blockchain-based system which determine the performance and security of the system. Ensuring the correctness of consensus protocols is uttermost important to create trust in the blockchain-based systems and formal methods are the way to create that trust and develop correct and verified systems. Formal modeling is a method of writing a system mathematically and examining the correctness and verifying the developed system. This study analyzed the importance of consensus mechanisms and how formal methods are helping to develop a correct blockchain-based system. The current scenario of the application of formal methods in the consensus mechanism of blockchain for their verification is presented.	consensus protocol;protocols;smart contracts;bitcoin;licenses;fingerprint recognition;distributed ledger;blockchain;consensus protocols;distributed ledger technology;formal methods;formal verificationchallenges
1304	核心技术	Optimization of PBFT Algorithm Based on QoS-Aware Trust Service Evaluation	In service-transaction scenarios, blockchain technology is widely used as an effective tool for establishing trust between service providers and consumers. The consensus algorithm is the core technology of blockchain. However, existing consensus algorithms, such as the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm, still suffer from high resource consumption and latency. To solve this problem, in this study, we propose an improved PBFT blockchain consensus algorithm based on quality of service (QoS)-aware trust service evaluation for secure and efficient service transactions. The proposed algorithm, called the QoS-aware trust practical Byzantine fault tolerance (QTPBFT) algorithm, efficiently achieves consensus, significantly reduces resource consumption, and enhances consensus efficiency. QTPBFT incorporates a QoS-aware trust service global evaluation mechanism that implements service reliability ranking by conducting a dynamic evaluation according to the real-time performance of the services. To reduce the traffic of the blockchain, it uses a mechanism that selects nodes with higher values to form a consensus group that votes for consensus according to the global evaluation result of the trust service. A practical protocol is also constructed for the proposed algorithm. The results of extensive simulations and comparison with other schemes verify the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.	qos-aware;blockchain;consensus mechanism;pbftconsensus
1305	核心技术	CrowdLBM: A lightweight blockchain-based model for mobile crowdsensing in the Internet of Things	With the commercialization of fifth generation mobile networks (5G) and continuous innovation of the Internet of Things (IoT), crowdsensing, as a new emerging IoT application, has further deepened our knowledge, utilizing various smart objects distributed throughout the whole industrial system for data collection and processing. To avoid a single point of failure and ensure data integrity, blockchain technology was widely applied. However, due to the demand for computing power and resources, IoT devices with limited capabilities and resources are unsuitable for crowdsensing implementation in the blockchain network. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight blockchainbased crowdsensing model named CrowdLBM with a novel consensus mechanism based on global reputation to resolve the issues raised above. Furthermore, we propose a two stage scheme and two types of smart contracts to support the crowdsensing process automatically without the intervention of any third party. Finally, we implement a blockchain prototype on Hyperledger Sawtooth, extensive experimental results show that the proposed CrowdLBM outperforms other crowdsensing systems in terms of both scalability and security.(C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

1306	核心技术	Raft-PLUS: Improving Raft by Multi-Policy Based Leader Election with Unprejudiced Sorting	Raft is a fast, scalable, understandable consensus algorithm widely used in distributed systems. The Leader handles client requests and interacts with other servers to reach a consensus, so a stable, reliable, and powerful Leader is crucial for the cluster. We designed a policy-based voting mechanism to make the elected Leader as reliable as possible. In order to improve the asymmetric relationship between the Followers and Leader, we designed a mechanism to trigger a new round of the election actively so that the Leader node can actively transform into a Follower under certain conditions and enhance the symmetry between servers. Our proposed Raft-PLUS algorithm makes the elected Leader as reliable as possible through four election policies and designed three opposition policies to trigger a new round of the election. To verify the effectiveness of the Raft-PLUS algorithm, we configure different election and opposition policies on 12 servers to simulate the election and opposition process of the Leader and explain the process. To demonstrate the advantages of the Raft-PLUS algorithm, we built key-value stores based on Raft and Raft-PLUS, and we tested the performance of Raft-PLUS and the Raft algorithm in normal and abnormal states. Experimental results show that the Raft-PLUS algorithm has similar write throughput to the Raft algorithm under normal conditions. Regarding the quality of the Leader network changes, the average write throughput of the Raft-PLUS algorithm is 40% higher than that of the Raft algorithm. The Leader's CPU usage fluctuated; the average write throughput of Raft-PLUS was 38% higher than Raft.	blockchain;consensus algorithm;raft;leader election
1307	实体经济	Blockchain Imaginaries and Their Metaphors: Organising Principles in Decentralised Digital Technologies	Heralded as revolutionary in their potential to improve efficiency, transparency, and sustainability, blockchain technologies promise new forms of large-scale coordination between actors that do not necessarily trust each other. This paper examines blockchain imaginaries and associated metaphors. Our analysis focuses on bitcoin and ethereum, today's most prominent blockchains that use the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. We identify three principles that organise blockchain imaginaries: substantial, morphological, and structural. These principles position blockchain as an enabler of economic, political and epistemological practices, respectively. Blockchain infrastructure and protocols rely on substantial metaphors (e.g. gold, gas) to govern resource allocation, morphological metaphors (e.g. work, trust) to generate consensus and structural metaphors (e.g. chain, transaction) to establish shared knowledge. Those imaginaries rely on metaphorical displacements of meaning that make blockchain technology relevant and intelligible while simultaneously shaping the direction of technological development and positing these technologies as new forms of economic, political and epistemological organisation. They are not merely descriptive but performative. We conclude by showing how these principles partially overlap with three symbolically generalized media: money, power and truth. Money organises scarcity within the economic system, power organises consensus within the political system, and truth organises knowledge within the science system.	blockchain;sociotechnical imaginaries;metaphors;digital sociologyglobal microstructures
1308	实体经济	REVIEW OF SMART CONTRACTS FOR CLOUD-BASED MANUFACTURING	Cloud-based manufacturing is taking shape, and many industries seem interested to make the transition to it. Developing blockchain solutions for trusted computing is also taking its roots. Developing a blockchain-based solution for cloud based manufacturing systems is a field that is new but also faces limitations and a lack of case studies. Smart contracts are one part of the solution which deals with making blockchain successful in cloud-based manufacturing. As we move towards smart contracts design and development for cloud-based manufacturing, there is no complete survey of smart contract and cloud manufacturing that can highlight critical, challenging issues and limitations. Most of the work found in smart contracts is mostly financial and notary-centric applications. On the cloud manufacturing side, most of the literature deals with Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing systems. Therefore, there is a need to study the best practices to start manufacturing supported by blockchain smart contracts. We conducted a scoping review for smart contracts for cloud manufacturing to address the problem mentioned above. We studied the latest case studies and concepts in data extracted from digital libraries and online repositories. Furthermore, we follow the relevance and acceptance criteria of research articles for inclusion and exclusion from this work. This paper focuses on blockchain systems, smart contracts and architecture, smart contracts in the cloud, and the IoT environment. Furthermore, we tried to bridge design and implementation details for readers to understand the patterns that can replicate for cloud-based manufacturing systems.	smart contract;blockchain;cloud manufacturing;cloud computingblockchain;challenges
1309	实体经济	Live video streaming service with pay-as-you-use model on Ethereum Blockchain and InterPlanetary file system	In centralized video streaming platforms, the platform owner, rather than the content producer, controls most of the content uploaded on the centralized video platform.-Blockchain-based video streaming systems aim to create decentralized peer-to-peer networks for video streaming services with various monetization options. Video transcoding is commonly used in the video streaming industry to convert videos into numerous formats for various viewers. We argue, however, that the standard media delivery framework may be modified by an InterPlanetary File System-based delivery network with Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure Live Streaming for any distribution model (live or on-demand). This paper examines the performance of decentralised video streaming platforms like NiftySubs, characterized by a 'pay-as-you-watch' subscription-based service paradigm, wherein the user only has to pay for the duration they watch the content on the Ethereum Blockchain. We also discuss the use of protocols like Unlock for providing access to locked content on the Blockchain, Superfluid Protocol money streams to enable actual time finance and storage of content on Content Delivery Network like InterPlanetary File System, which are based on content-based addressing mechanisms. Finally, we also discuss challenges and solutions by which the security of content can be established and maintained and how users can view accurate time usage statistics with the help of indexing solutions like the Graph Protocol.	blockchain;ethereum;smart contracts;interplanetary file system;livepeer;live video streaming;superfluid;textile framework;decentralized application;real-time finance
1310	协同技术	Proximal policy optimization-based committee selection algorithm in blockchain-enabled mobile edge computing systems	To cope with the low latency requirements and security issues of the emerging applications such as Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the blockchain-enabled Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system has received extensive attention. However, blockchain is a computing and communication intensive technology due to the complex consensus mechanisms. To facilitate the implementation of blockchain in the MEC system, this paper adopts the committee-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm and focuses on the committee selection problem. Vehicles and IIoT devices generate the transactions which are records of the application tasks. Base Stations (BSs) with MEC servers, which serve the transactions according to the wireless channel quality and the available computing resources, are blockchain nodes and candidates for committee members. The income of transaction service fees, the penalty of service delay, the decentralization of the blockchain and the communication complexity of the consensus process constitute the performance index. The committee selection problem is modeled as a Markov decision process, and the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is adopted in the solution. Simulation results show that the proposed PPO-based committee selection algorithm can adapt to the system design requirements with different emphases and outperforms other comparison methods.	blockchains;task analysis;servers;resource management;industrial internet of things;consensus algorithm;real-time systems;blockchain;mobile edge computing;deep reinforcement learning;consensus mechanisminternet;networks
1311	技术治理	SPCBIG-EC: A Robust Serial Hybrid Model for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection	With countless devices connected to the Internet of Things, trust mechanisms are especially important. IoT devices are more deeply embedded in the privacy of people's lives, and their security issues cannot be ignored. Smart contracts backed by blockchain technology have the potential to solve these problems. Therefore, the security of smart contracts cannot be ignored. We propose a flexible and systematic hybrid model, which we call the Serial-Parallel Convolutional Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Network Model incorporating Ensemble Classifiers (SPCBIG-EC). The model showed excellent performance benefits in smart contract vulnerability detection. In addition, we propose a serial-parallel convolution (SPCNN) suitable for our hybrid model. It can extract features from the input sequence for multivariate combinations while retaining temporal structure and location information. The Ensemble Classifier is used in the classification phase of the model to enhance its robustness. In addition, we focused on six typical smart contract vulnerabilities and constructed two datasets, CESC and UCESC, for multi-task vulnerability detection in our experiments. Numerous experiments showed that SPCBIG-EC is better than most existing methods. It is worth mentioning that SPCBIG-EC can achieve F1-scores of 96.74%, 91.62%, and 95.00% for reentrancy, timestamp dependency, and infinite loop vulnerability detection.	blockchain;iot;smart contract;vulnerability detection;deep learning;serial hybrid networksmote

1313	虚拟经济	Smart Factory Using Virtual Reality and Online Multi-User: Towards a Metaverse for Experimental Frameworks	Virtual reality (VR) has been brought closer to the general public over the past decade as it has become increasingly available for desktop and mobile platforms. As a result, consumer-grade VR may redefine how people learn by creating an engaging "hands-on" training experience. Today, VR applications leverage rich interactivity in a virtual environment without real-world consequences to optimize training programs in companies and educational institutions. Therefore, the main objective of this article was to improve the collaboration and communication practices in 3D virtual worlds with VR and metaverse focused on the educational and productive sector in smart factory. A key premise of our work is that the characteristics of the real environment can be replicated in a virtual world through digital twins, wherein new, configurable, innovative, and valuable ways of working and learning collaboratively can be created using avatar models. To do so, we present a proposal for the development of an experimental framework that constitutes a crucial first step in the process of formalizing collaboration in virtual environments through VR-powered metaverses. The VR system includes functional components, object-oriented configurations, advanced core, interfaces, and an online multi-user system. We present the study of the first application case of the framework with VR in a metaverse, focused on the smart factory, that shows the most relevant technologies of Industry 4.0. Functionality tests were carried out and evaluated with users through usability metrics that showed the satisfactory results of its potential educational and commercial use. Finally, the experimental results show that a commercial software framework for VR games can accelerate the development of experiments in the metaverse to connect users from different parts of the world in real time.	virtual reality;3d virtual worlds;metaverse;smart factory;industry 4;0;3d modeling;unreal engine 4industry 4.0;education;system

A variety of issues associated with it have been raised, such as network security, cryptoasset management and sustainability impacts. Investigating Bitcoin mining from a spatial perspective will provide new angles and empirical evidence with respect to extant literature. Here we explore the spatial distribution of Bitcoin mining through bottom-up tracking and geospatial statistics. We find that mining activity has been detected at more than 6000 geographical units across 139 countries and regions, which is in line with the distributed design of Bitcoin network. However, in terms of computing power, it has demonstrated a strong tendency of spatial concentration and association with energy production locations. We also discover that the spatial distribution of Bitcoin mining is dynamic, which fluctuates with diverse patterns, according to economic and regulatory changes.	energy
1316	法律治理	How effective is China's cryptocurrency trading ban?	Cryptocurrency trading is subject to strict government-imposed restrictions in China since September 2017, when trading platforms were shut down. Using a VAR-GARCH-BEKK model, we investigate the effectiveness of this trading ban by examining its consequences on the relationship between Chinese investors' attention and Bitcoin. Our results demonstrate that Chinese investors played a dominant role in the Bitcoin price formation before the ban, and that their influence has not significantly decreased after the shutdown of Chinese trading platforms. Aiming to explain our findings, we provide strong evidence that the crackdown on Bitcoin trading has not been effective as Chinese investors continue to purchase Bitcoin using the stablecoin Tether instead of Chinese yuan.	chinese bitcoin trading ban;investor attention;tether;var-garch-bekkinvestor attention;bitcoin;gold

Extant literature documented various macro-economic factors and technical factors to price Bitcoin. However, for a highly speculative instrument, investors' behavior plays an important role in asset pricing. This paper incorporates Bitcoin Ethereum synchronicity conditional on upside volatility of Bitcoin as a proxy for the fear of high Bitcoin prices. Empirical results reveal that when upside volatility is high, Ethereum synchronicity exerts a significant positive influence on Bitcoin crash risk.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;crash risk;synchronicity;upside volatilityreturns;cryptocurrency;volume;world

The study sample covers the period of August 2011 to September 2020 and therefore includes the current coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Using a logistic smooth transition regression model (LSTR2), the study findings indicate the ability of monitored cryptocurrencies to act as safe-haven assets, but such behavior differs across markets. Interestingly, during the pandemic period, Ethereum provides the strongest safe haven function for the commodity market. According to our findings, we are mindful of that the COVID-19 outbreak provides an exciting opportunity to advance our knowledge of the prominence of new coins such as Ethereum that are gradually gaining supremacy in the cryptocurrency market to the detriment of traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.	cryptocurrencies;covid-19 pandemic;safe-haven;logistic smooth transition regression model;financial marketsbitcoin;volatility;hedge;gold
1321	市场治理	A tale of two tails among carbon prices, green and non-green cryptocurrencies	This paper studies the tail dependence among carbon prices, green and non-green cryptocurrencies. Using daily closing prices of carbon, green and non-green cryptocurrencies from 2017 to 2021 and a quantile connectedness framework, we find evidence of asymmetric tail dependence among these markets, with stronger dependence during highly volatile periods. Moreover, carbon prices are largely disconnected from cryptocurrencies during periods of low volatilities, while Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibit time-varying spillovers to other markets. Our results also show that green cryptocurrencies are weakly connected to Bitcoin and Ethereum, and their net connectedness are close to 0, except during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we find a significant influence of macroeconomic and financial factors on the tail dependence among carbon, green and non-green cryptocurrency markets. Our results highlight the time-varying diversification benefits across carbon, green and non-green cryptocurrencies and have important implications for investors and policymakers	dirty cryptocurrency;carbon prices;tail dependence;green cryptocurrencyimpulse-response analysis;safe haven;energy;volatility;bitcoin;spillovers;hedge;oil;connectedness;markets

We document the existence of very few similar effects in the examined cryptocurrencies. Generally, anomalies found in Bitcoin do not hold for other cryptocurrencies and vice versa. The within-the-month effect is the only effect common to all cryptocurrencies.

The results show all hedging costs are increasing during the pandemic. When the study's hedging effectiveness is generally evaluated, BTC provides better protection against ESM indices than ETH. Moreover, during the pre-pandemic period, investors should create portfolios using an optimal weights-based strategy rather than a hedged portfolio-based strategy. Finally, while BTC and ETH have weak safe-haven properties against most ESM indices, only BTC have strong safe-haven properties against the Malaysia stock index during the pandemic period.	covid-19;safe-haven;cryptocurrency;hedging effectiveness;emerging market;hedgebitcoin;hedge
1324	市场治理	The Complexity of Cryptocurrencies Algorithmic Trading	In this research, we provided an answer to a very important trading question, what is the optimal number of technical tools in order to achieve the best trading results for both swing trade that uses daily bars and intraday trade that uses minutes bars? We designed Machine Learning (ML) systems that can trade four major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and Solana. We found that more indicators do not necessarily mean better trading performance. Swing traders that use daily bars should trade Bitcoin and Solana using Ichimoku Cloud (IC) plus Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Ethereum with IC plus Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), and BNB with IC alone. With regard to intraday trading, we documented that different cryptocurrencies should be trading using different time frames. These results emphasize that the optimal number of indicators that are used to trade daily bars is one or, at maximum, two. The Multi-Layer (MUL) system that consists of all three examined technical indicators failed to improve the trading results for both days (swing) and intraday trades. The main implication of this study for traders is that more indicators does not necessarily improve trades performances.	cryptocurrencies;trading;intraday;swing;technical indicatorsneural-networks;prediction;deep
1325	市场治理	An intra-cryptocurrency analysis of volatility connectedness and its determinants: Evidence from mining coins, non-mining coins and tokens	This paper analysis the dynamic of the volatility connectedness between three main categories of the cryptocurrency market (mineable coins, non-mineable coins and tokens).1 Furthermore, it investigates factors (internal and external) that can help to predict the net directional and total volatility connectedness indices. We find that the CC market is highly connected where mining coins dominate the CC market and are typically net transmitter of shocks. For the non-mining coins, a low connectedness with all mining coins and tokens versus a high connectedness with Stellar are highlighted. The results show also that, unlike previous studies, Ethereum is the dominant contributor to volatility spillover and the only CC net pairwise transmitter in our sample. Interestingly, we find that most of the tokens are highly connected with their platform (Ethereum) rather than bitcoin. Finally, we find that both financial and macroeconomic indicators play an important role in explaining the total and net directional connectedness, a result that can significantly help cryptocurrency market participants and investors improve their risk management and the benefits from diversification.	mineable coins;non-mineable coins;tokens;connectedness;economic fundamentals;financial factorsimpulse-response analysis;economic value;bitcoin;market;spillovers;variance;return
1326	市场治理	Intraday return predictability in the cryptocurrency markets: Momentum, reversal, or both	This paper reports evidence of intraday return predictability, consisting of both intraday momentum and reversal, in the cryptocurrency market. Using high-frequency price data on Bitcoin from March 3, 2013, to May 31, 2020, it shows that the patterns of intraday return predictability change in the presence of large intraday price jumps, FOMC announcement release, liquidity levels, and the outbreak of the COVID-19. Intraday return predictability is also found in other actively traded cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. Further analysis shows that the timing strategy based on the intraday predictors produces higher economic value than the benchmark strategy such as the always-long or the buy-and-hold. Evidence of intraday momentum can be explained in light of the theory of late-informed investors, whereas evidence of intraday reversal, which is unique to the cryptocurrency market, can be related to investors' overreaction to non-fundamental information and overconfidence bias.	intraday return predictability;cryptocurrency markets;bitcoin;momentum;reversal;economic value;market timing strategystock returns;bitcoin;volatility;hedge
1327	市场治理	Multivariate long memory structure in the cryptocurrency market: The impact of COVID-19 br	In this paper, we study the long memory behavior of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, and Dash with a focus on the COVID-19 period. Initially, we apply a time-varying Lifting method to estimate the Hurst exponent for each cryptocurrency. Then we test for a change in persistence over time. To model the multivariate con-nectivity, the wavelet-based multivariate long memory approach proposed by Achard and Gannaz (2016) is implemented. Our results indicate a change in the long-range dependence for the majority of cryptocurrencies, with a noticeable downward trend in persistence after the 2017 bubble and then a dramatic drop after the outbreak of COVID-19. The drop in persistence after COVID-19 is further illustrated by the Fractal connectivity matrix obtained from the Wavelet long-memory model.

1328	市场治理	Bitcoin: An inflation hedge but not a safe haven	During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many commonalities shared by Bitcoin and gold raise the question of whether Bitcoin can hedge inflation or provide a safe haven as gold often does. By estimating a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we provide systematic evidence on the relationship among inflation, uncertainty, and Bitcoin and gold prices. Bitcoin appreciates against inflation (or inflation expectation) shocks, confirming its inflation-hedging property claimed by investors. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin prices decline in response to financial uncertainty shocks, rejecting the safe-haven quality. Interestingly, Bitcoin prices do not decrease after policy uncertainty shocks, partly consistent with the notion of Bitcoin's independence from government authorities. We also find an interesting asymmetry in the drivers of Bitcoin price dynamics between the bullish and bearish market. The main findings hold with or without the COVID-19 pandemic episode.	cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;inflation-hedging;safe-haven;gold;covid-19us dollar;gold

Moreover, this research applied the VAR (1)-GARCH (1, 1) model to investigate the spillover effect from the stock market to Bitcoin.

Specifically, we examine the presence of reduction in downside risk after mixing gold/Bitcoin with such energy commodities. To do this, we account for dependence among energy commodities and gold/Bitcoin returns by applying a (vine) copula. The findings show that gold substantially reduces the downside risk of a portfolio containing any allocation to gold and energy commodities, indicating its safe-haven ability. In contrast, Bitcoin's safe-haven functionality is inconsistent since the downside risk reduction is achieved for Bitcoin's small allocation only.	bitcoin;covid-19;gold;downside risk;safe haven;vine copuladownside risk;hedge;price;stocks

Using a hand-collected dataset containing bullish, neutral, and bearish predictions for Bitcoin published by crypto experts, we show that neutral and bearish predictions are followed by negative abnormal returns whereas bullish predictions are not associated with nonzero abnormal returns. Based on all outstanding predictions, we compute prediction revisions relative to (i) the latest issued prediction and (ii) the outstanding consensus prediction. Downward revisions are followed by negative abnormal returns. We conclude that crypto experts are skilled information intermediaries on the Bitcoin market.	bitcoin;experts;analysts;market efficiency;predictions;forecasts;cryptocurrenciesdirectional accuracy;forecasts;prices
1332	市场治理	Nonlinear dynamics analysis of cryptocurrency price fluctuations based on Bitcoin	The price fluctuation of cryptocurrencies represented by Bitcoin has nonlinear structure characteristics. We select the Bitcoin closing price data from 2013 to 2021, and use GARCH (1,1)-GED to fit the volatility series. We confirm that Bitcoin price Fluctuation has nonlinear dynamics through BDS test, Hurst exponent, correlation dimension test and Lyapunov exponent. We find that the price fluctuation of cryptocurrency does not obey the random walk, and its fluctuation is positively correlated with time. Bullish information and bearish information have basically the same impact on cryptocurrency fluctuations. Cryptocurrency price fluctuations have cyclical trends and inherent long-term unpredictability, as well as certain fractal and chaos characteristics. ARCH effect and long memory characteristics of cryptocurrency return series show that cryptocurrency price fluctuations are Clustering and persistence. These two characteristics constitute the nonlinear dynamic mechanism of Bitcoin price fluctuation. Overall, our study has important implications for investors and regulators within cryptocurrency markets.	cryptocurrency;nonlinear dynamics analysis;bds test;long memory;price fluctuations
1333	市场治理	When Tether says "JUMP!" Bitcoin asks "How low?"	While stablecoins such as Tether closely track the peg, there is some evidence for recurring spikes in stablecoins' intraday volatilities rendering stablecoin volatilities unstable (Grobys et al., 2021). Using the Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2006a) methodology, the purpose of our study is to examine whether jumps in Tether have an impact on (subsequent) Bitcoin returns. We retrieve hourly data for Bitcoin and Tether from Bitfinex covering the November 2018 to June 2021 period and encode the binary choice (1 - 'jump' and 0 - 'no jump') using bi-power variation based on asymptotic distribution theory at 5% significance level for each trading day. Our results show that the joint effect of positive jumps in Tether in association with an 1% increase in Tether returns on the prior day significantly predict negative prices changes in Bitcoin ranging from-3.65% to-8.49% in daily terms. Our results remain robust even after controlling for various other variables.	bitcoin;brownian semimartingales;bipower variations;cryptocurrency;granger-causality test;jumps;stable coin;tetherimpact
1334	市场治理	Robust drivers of Bitcoin price movements: An extreme bounds analysis	There is a growing stream of empirical research that endeavors to identify the influential variables contributing to the price formation of cryptocurrencies and, in particular, Bitcoin. However, results of those studies generally remain inconsistent in terms of not only the true combination of factors that affect Bitcoin prices, but also the nature of effects (positive vs. negative) that each individual factor has on the price behavior. The present study investigates the robustness of a wide variety of candidate determinants that have been the focus of attention in relevant literature. Our inquiry relies on the extreme bounds analysis (EBA), which is a type of large-scale sensitivity analysis capable of addressing model uncertainty issues. The findings suggest that crypto market forces of supply and demand, public interest, and economic policy uncertainty are the only variables robust to all possible variations in the conditioning information set. Our evidence argues in favor of the predominance of cryptocurrency-related determinants over global macroeconomic and financial ones in explaining Bitcoin price movements.	cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;extreme bounds analysis;price determinantsstock return predictability;autoregressive time-series;safe haven;sensitivity-analysis;unit-root;uncertainty;volatility;cryptocurrencies;determinants;hedge
1335	技术治理	CTRF: Ethereum-Based Ponzi Contract Identification	In recent years, blockchain technology has been developing rapidly. More and more traditional industries are using blockchain as a platform for information storage and financial transactions, mainly because of its new characteristics of non-tamperability and decentralization compared with the traditional systems. As a representative of blockchain 2.0, Ethereum has gained popularity upon its introduction. However, because of the anonymity of blockchain, Ethereum has also attracted the attention of some unscrupulous people. Currently, millions of contracts are deployed on Ethereum, many of which are fraudulent contracts deployed by unscrupulous people for profit, and these contracts are causing huge losses to investors worldwide. Ponzi contracts are typical of these contracts, which mainly reward the funds invested by later investors to early investors, and later investors will have no gain. However, although there are some studies for identifying Ponzi contracts on Ethereum, there is some room for progress in the research. Therefore, we propose a method to detect Ponzi scheme contracts on Ethereum-CTRF. This method forms a dataset by extracting the word features and sequence features of the smart contract's code and the features of transactions. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. Oversampling is performed on the training set to deal with the problem of positive and negative sample imbalance. Finally, the model is trained on the training set and tested on the test set. The experimental results show that the model has significantly improved recall compared with existing Ponzi contract detection methods.	
1336	技术治理	FA-GNN: Filter and Augment Graph Neural Networks for Account Classification in Ethereum	As the first blockchain platform supporting smart contracts, Ethereum has become increasingly popular in recent years and generates a massive number of transaction records. Nowadays, millions of accounts in Ethereum have been reported to participate in a variety of businesses, and some of them have been found to be involved in illegal behaviors or even cyber-crimes by exploiting the pseudonymous nature of blockchain. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an effective method to conduct account classification and audit transaction behaviors of each account. In this paper, we model the Ethereum transaction records as a transaction network, and the account classification problem is converted to a node classification problem. Based on the Ethereum transaction network, we propose a novel framework named Filter and Augment Graph Neural Network (FA-GNN), which can retain the information of important neighbors and augment node features with high-order information. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FA-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Ethereum account classification.	blockchains;task analysis;feature extraction;cryptocurrency;peer-to-peer computing;graph neural networks;network analyzers;blockchain;complex network;ethereum;network embedding;transaction network
1337	技术治理	Analyzing and de-anonymizing Bitcoin networks: An IP matching method with clustering and heuristics	The anonymity and de-anonymity of blockchain and Bitcoin have always been a hot topic in blockchain related research. Since Bitcoin was created by Nakamoto in 2009, it has, to some extent, deviated from its currency attribute as a trading medium but instead turned into an object for financial investment and operations. In this paper, the power-law distribution that the Bitcoin network obeys is given with mathematical proof, while traditional de-anonymous methods such as clustering fail to satisfy it. Therefore, considering the profit-oriented characteristics of Bitcoin traders in such occasion, we put forward a de-anonymous heuristic approach that recognizes and analyzes the behavioral patterns of financial High-Frequency Transactions(HFT), with realtime exchange rate of Bitcoin involved. With heuristic approach used for de-anonymity, algorithm that deals with the adjacency matrix and transition probability matrix are also put forward, which then makes it possible to apply clustering to the IP matching method. Basing on the heuristic approach and additional algorithm for clustering, finally we established the de-anonymous method that matches the activity information of the IP with the transaction records in blockchain. Experiments on IP matching method are applied to the actual data. It turns out that similar behavioral pattern between IP and transaction records are shown, which indicates the superiority of IP matching method.	bitcoin;clustering methods;blockchains;ip networks;exchange rates;clustering algorithms;behavioral sciences;bitcoin;blockchain;de-anonymization;heuristics
1338	核心技术	Practical AgentChain: A compatible cross-chain exchange system	Blockchain is a decentralized ledger system that enables transactional consensus among untrusted nodes. Due to the independence between blockchains, it is tough to complete asset exchange tasks between diverse chains. Facing this problem, multiple cross-chain exchange schemes were proposed, but they have not been widely used due to various defects in terms of compatibility, flexibility, security, and practicability. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive cross-chain exchange system called Practical AgentChain. Various coins can be mapped to the corresponding tokens on Practical AgentChain for trading. One or multiple trading operators can spontaneously form a service deposit pool on existing blockchains and register a trading group for profit using the well-designed smart contract called Agent Contract. All the trading groups competitively provide cross-chain exchange services. Clients with exchange currency requirements can freely select an appropriate trading group to request services, such as mapping assets to tokens or withdraw tokens. The choice of the trading group is made according to the group's deposit and the group members' reputation recorded on the Agent Contract. This system also incorporates Town crier as the reliable Data Oracle system for obtaining the status of cross-chain transactions and combines a matching exchange protocol to ensure the fairness of on-chain token exchange. In addition, we design an impartial service arbitration mechanism and a deposit allocation scheme to ensure the reliability of the system. Through security analysis, our system can resist re-use attacks, denial-of-service attacks and resolve service availability issues. We modify the Town crier adaptively and combine it with Ethereum to implement the simulation. The experimental results show that Practical AgentChain is efficient and low-cost. Besides, our system can be deployed on any existing blockchain that supports smart contracts since the system's architecture is highly portable. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

1339	核心技术	Hash time locked contract based asset exchange solution for probabilistic public blockchains	The rapid growth of blockchain technology is giving rise to siloed blockchains. Blockchains can efficiently store values and assets, but their inability to interoperate is reducing their usability. Lack of cross-chain exchange of assets and data is hindering the novel developments using blockchain technology. Interoperability solutions designed for blockchains mostly use a trusted third party: centralized or decentralized. Atomic swap solutions provide cross-chain asset exchange without involving any trusted third party. However, most of the atomic swap solutions proposed in the literature are for private blockchain and are not practically implemented. This paper proposes a solution for implementing an atomic swap between public blockchains using Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC). We have also formulated the time-lock equations using the confirmation time of probabilistic blockchains to be used in HTLC. The accuracy of proposed time-lock equations and the performance of the atomic swap solution is evaluated by implementing HTLC between Ethereum and Tron blockchains. Redeem and refund functions of HTLC are implemented as conflicting events, and only one of the two can execute for an atomic swap. The implemented atomic swap solution maintains atomicity and adheres to time-lock values calculated using the proposed time-lock equations.	blockchain;atomic swap;atomic cross-chain swap;smart contract;hash time locked contract
1340	实体经济	Supply chain management based on volatility clustering: The effect of CBDC volatility	A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) launched by the Bank of England could enable businesses to directly make electronic payments. It can be argued that digital payment is helpful in supply chain management applications. However, the adoption of CBDC in the supply chain could bring new turbulence since the CBDC value may fluctuate. Therefore, this paper intends to optimize the production plan of manufacturing supply chain based on a volatility clustering model by reducing CBDC value uncertainty. We apply both GARCH model and machine learning model to depict the CBDC volatility clustering. Empirically, we employed Baltic Dry Index, Bitcoin and exchange rate as main variables with sample period from 2015 to 2021 to evaluate the performance of the two models. On this basis, we reveal that our machine learning model overwhelmingly outperforms the GARCH model. Consequently, our result implies that manufacturing companies' performance can be strengthened through CBDC uncertainty reduction.	cbdc;volatility clustering;machine learning;digital currency;supply chain managementprice volatility;blockchain;bitcoin;garch;risk;uncertainty;design;models
1341	协同技术	Private decentralized crowdsensing with asynchronous blockchain access	Because of the popularity of mobile devices, crowdsensing has emerged as a data sensing paradigm for collecting large-scale data. Blockchain technology is promising to address problems of privacy and trust existing in centralized crowdsensing systems. However, it is challenging for crowdsensing applications to use a public blockchain to collect real-time or large-scale data since current blockchain systems lack of scalability. We propose a crowdsensing scheme that combines Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) with a public blockchain, achieving high efficiency with guarantees of privacy and trust. The scheme is a layer-two blockchain solution that supports off-chain multi-round sensing-data evaluations inside TEE enclaves, so that the sensing data needs not be propagated over the blockchain network. Besides, the scheme prevents false-reporting and free-riding for workers and requesters without reliance on a trusted third party. Moreover, the scheme secures the sensing data, letting only the worker and the corresponding requester know the data. Evaluations of our experimental prototype demonstrate the efficiency of our designs, as well as the reasonable on-chain monetary cost of running a task's smart contract and performing token payments using Ethereum.	crowdsensing;blockchain;trusted execution environment;efficiency;trust;privacy
1342	虚拟经济	NFTs and asset class spillovers: Lessons from the period around the COVID-19 pandemic	In this paper, we analyze the connectedness between returns for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other financial assets (equities, bonds, currencies, gold, oil, Ethereum) during the period from January 2018 to June 2021. By using the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressions (TVPVAR) approach, we show that the overall connectedness between the returns for financial assets increased during the COVID-19 period. Our static analysis shows that the behavior of the majority of NFT returns is attributable to endogenous shocks and only a small portion of this variation resulted from the impact of innovation in other assets. The results suggest that NFTs are mainly independent of shocks from common assets classes and even from their close relation, Ethereum. The dynamic analysis across time reveals that during normal times, NFTs act as transmitters of systemic risk to some degree, but during stressful times, their role shifts, and they act as absorbers of risk spillovers. This suggests that NFTs may have diversification benefits during turbulent times, as apparent during the COVID-19 crisis, and especially around the great March 2020 market plunge.	nft;return connectedness;covid-19;non-fungible tokens;spilloverconnectedness

We document media coverage as a net transmitter of spillover for both the return and volatility of NFT segments. We find that NFTs representing the Utilities segment is a major transmitter of spillover. Our findings have important implications for portfolio managers, regulators, and policymakers.	connectedness;covid-19;non-fungible tokens (nft);spillover;media coverageimpulse-response analysis
1344	核心技术	Research for smart contract-based problem recommendation algorithm	As a method for learners to learn independently in distance education, the need for a problem recommendation learning guide that effectively reflects a learning pattern based on learner data is increasing. In this paper, based on blockchain Ethereum smart contract technology, we analyze and present problem recommendation patterns for individual learners by filtering, collecting, and transparently managing multiple learner data that can occur in a distance education environment. In this study, various weighting factors were assigned to each learning situation. The optimal problem recommendation path is presented so that learners can solve problems based on weight-based learning factors in various learning situations. For the performance evaluation of this study, a similar learning environment was set up, and learning satisfaction, usefulness of problem recommendation guides, and learner data processing speed were analyzed. As a result of the performance evaluation, it was confirmed that the learning satisfaction improved by more than 15% compared to the existing learning environment in the proposed environment. In addition, it was confirmed that the learning data processing speed was improved by more than 17%. (C) 2022 The Authors.

1345	核心技术	Preparing Auditors for the Blockchain Oracle Problem	This article summarizes "Auditing the Blockchain Oracle Problem" (Sheldon 2021), which introduces auditors to the risks of having an irreversible business agreement codified on a blockchain using a short software program called a smart contract that relies on an oracle to provide information from outside the blockchain in order to execute correctly. The article begins with an explanation of the role that oracles play in the blockchain ecosystem and proposes a working definition of oracles. Next, the article highlights how the auditing standards from both the AICPA and PCAOB can be interpreted to classify an oracle as part of smart contract users' information systems, and that the oracle provides a robust set of services that qualify it as a service organization. Finally, the article describes the process used by an oracle to collect, store, transform, and transmit data, and highlights relevant risks and illustrative control objectives related to this process.	blockchain;oracle problem;smart contract;service organization;audit
1346	核心技术	Self-Renewal Consortium Blockchain Based on Proof of Rest and Strong Smart Contracts	Focusing on the business alliance scenario in blockchains, this paper proposes a new consensus mechanism named proof of rest (PoR) and strong smart contracts. The block structure and logic of PoR consensus are described. And a consortium blockchain system supporting strong smart contracts is designed. We modify the difficulty value algorithm based on proof of work (PoW) and add adjustable parameters. The longer a node rests after creating a block, the less difficult it is to create another new block, hence the term PoR. The penalty for slack nodes, the joining and quitting of nodes, and the adjustment of the expected block creation time can all be accomplished using the strong smart contracts, so the consortium blockchain can realize self-renewal.	smart contracts;public key;focusing;proof of work;consensus protocol;ip networks;eavesdropping;blockchain;consortium chain;proof of rest (por);smart contract;self-renewal
1347	核心技术	SMART CONTRACTS AND THEIR RECOGNITION BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM	Smart contracts emerged with the development of the blockchains and made it possible for contractual agreements to be fulfilled automatically, without the intervention of a third party. The present work aims to analyze the incorporation of Smart contracts in the legal system, confronting them with the contract theory; being relevant because of the little legal literature on them, the available one comes from Asian and Anglo-Saxon countries, being necessary to address this problem by Latin American doctrinarians and thus provide tools that allow the updating of our legal systems. The methodology is qualitative, the hermeneutic method was used, which allowed the analysis of the documents. It was concluded that smarts contracts can be considered contracts from the legal point of view, but with their own characteristics due to their technological nature. Within the legal system they would be placed in private law with difficult intervention of the State in case of non-compliance.	smart contracts;blockchain;contract;legal system
1348	虚拟经济	Metaverse and Virtual Health Care in Ophthalmology: Opportunities and Challenges	The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 has further increased the urgent need for digital transformation within the health care settings, with the use of artificial intelligence/deep learning, internet of things, telecommunication network/virtual platform, and blockchain. The recent advent of metaverse, an interconnected online universe, with the synergistic combination of augmented, virtual, and mixed reality described several years ago, presents a new era of immersive and real-time experiences to enhance human-to-human social interaction and connection. In health care and ophthalmology, the creation of virtual environment with three-dimensional (3D) space and avatar, could be particularly useful in patient-fronting platforms (eg, telemedicine platforms), operational uses (eg, meeting organization), digital education (eg, simulated medical and surgical education), diagnostics, and therapeutics. On the other hand, the implementation and adoption of these emerging virtual health care technologies will require multipronged approaches to ensure interoperability with real-world virtual clinical settings, user-friendliness of the technologies and clinical efficiencies while complying to the clinical, health economics, regulatory, and cybersecurity standards. To serve the urgent need, it is important for the eye community to continue to innovate, invent, adapt, and harness the unique abilities of virtual health care technology to provide better eye care worldwide.	augmented reality;metaverse;mixed reality;ophthalmology;virtual realityartificial-intelligence;cost-effectiveness;augmented reality;covid-19;telemedicine;technology;teleophthalmology;retinopathy;experience;teleconsultation
1349	协同技术	RBSmix: A Regulatable Privacy-Preserving Method for Cryptocurrency	Public chains represented by Bitcoin and Ethereum do not require users to use their real names, and transaction data are open to the whole network. Analysed based on this, researchers have achieved the deanonymization of blockchain transactions to a certain extent. Based on the existing blockchain transaction privacy protection scheme, the true link relationship between the transaction sender and receiver is hidden, which brings difficulties to regulation. In this paper, we propose a cryptocurrency mixing service RBSmix, which allows users to reestablish their financial privacy in Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. RBSmix, through blind signature to prevent attackers from linking input and output addresses, by the threshold secret sharing algorithm, encryption technology, and a regulation team, combined with the idea of voting, tracks the source of funds for illegal addresses. Experiments show that the scheme scales to large numbers of users and can provide users with better privacy protection.	
1350	协同技术	Privacy Protection of Medical Service Data Based on Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence in the Era of Smart Medical Care	Smart medical care will realize the self-management, selection, and optimization of related things with more thorough induction, more comprehensive interconnection, and more intelligent insight, so that people can get an increasingly personalized medical and health service experience. 5G-enabled Internet of Things and AI (artificial intelligence) will continue to drive innovative applications in the medical industry. Access control and sharing of medical data is of great significance to the development of smart medical care, but the security problems in medical data sharing cannot be ignored. In this paper, a privacy protection scheme of medical service data based on blockchain and AI is proposed. The user chain is constructed as a public chain. In the user chain, the data privacy of users is protected, and users can safely transmit data to doctors and realize the management of session keys. CNN (convolutional neural network) privacy protection protocol based on homomorphic encryption can protect users' privacy input, server model parameters, and calculated intermediate values. Experimental analysis and comparison with other schemes show that the scheme in this model is safer and more practical.	scheme;internet;secure

Formerly, those chores have been performed out along with individuals; eventually, individuals acquired attraction because to its precision and efficiency. The proposed study will examine the activities and possible capabilities of learning algorithms and blockchain in the healthcare professions focusing on these fascinating facts. Primary and secondary data analysis has been executed, with primary analysis method consisting of a survey of 150 randomly picked medicine professionals with expertise in machine learning and blockchain. They gave their answers that were being subsequently transferred to figures and employed as response variable in SPSS examining. The length of time where learning and blockchain have been used in medicine is really the independent factor. To better understand the primary and small hurdles of integrating machine learning and blockchain, a correlation investigation was done. Thereafter, secondary methodology is employed to validate the primary study results.	
1352	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Contact Tracing and Information Sharing Model for COVID-19 Pandemic	COVID-19 is the worst contagious disaster in the history of humankind, triggering a worldwide sickness pandemic. In lacking specialized treatments or immunizations, finding and eliminating the infection source is the best option to decrease disease transmission and lower sickness and degree of fatality among the general public. Generally, few significant barriers are present in the existing system of monitoring the contamination. One of the obstacles is regarding health-related data storage. The user's e-health data is kept in a traditional method that might have been compromised if shared with third parties. Secondly, the current disease tracking technologies fail to monitor diseases numerous ways. The tracing system is either personal or location-based. Apart from these, gathering individual consent and sharing their health data with unknown associations is a real-time problem. We propose a blockchain-based data system that maintains confidentiality with transparency. Users can acquire unlimited and nontampered vital routes as the suggested blockchain solution leverages to link the user/patient and approved solvers. Also, automatically executed smart contracts are constructed to desensitize the user ID and reallocation. The anonymous feature delivered by private blockchain with wireless technologies defends the customer's identity secrecy. We develop a matching approach using machine learning technology. Users may take safeguards in advance by employing our suggested analytical technique for predicting the risk due to infectious source presence.	
1353	实体经济	Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things (AI-IoT) Technologies in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review	The origin of the COVID-19 pandemic has given overture to redirection, as well as innovation to many digital technologies. Even after the progression of vaccination efforts across the globe, total eradication of this pandemic is still a distant future due to the evolution of new variants. To proactively deal with the pandemic, the health care service providers and the caretaker organizations require new technologies, alongside improvements in existing related technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning in terms of infrastructure, efficiency, privacy, and security. This paper provides an overview of current theoretical and application prospects of IoT, AI, cloud computing, edge computing, deep learning techniques, blockchain technologies, social networks, robots, machines, privacy, and security techniques. In consideration of these prospects in intersection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed the technologies within the broad umbrella of AI-IoT technologies in the most concise classification scheme. In this review, we illustrated that AI-IoT technological applications and innovations have most impacted the field of healthcare. The essential AI-IoT technologies found for healthcare were fog computing in IoT, deep learning, and blockchain.

1354	协同技术	Blockchain-Based IoT-Enabled System for Secure and Efficient Logistics Management in the Era of IR 4.0	As the global logistics business expands as a result of the industrial 4.0 revolution, logistics operations continue to evolve as new technologies such as IoT, cloud, and big data are deployed. These IoT devices improve the logistics function by boosting real-time product tracking, improved data collection, smart storage of logistics data, etc. Some of these new technologies present an avenue for cyberattacks on these logistics systems due to their centralized database structure. Logistics operations entail the exchange of private consumer information (name, address, phone number, and bank account information) as well as product information amongst logistics stakeholders (manufacturers, suppliers, transporters, and customers). And the engagement of so many logistics stakeholders creates privacy and security issues for the private information because customer information, as well as product details, are transferred and shared across different logistical stakeholders during the logistics process. It faces unwanted access, which could lead to fraud or the creation of counterfeit products by a bad actor in the system. All of these challenges are significant because logistics data integrity is important for customer satisfaction. The deployment of Blockchain innovation will address these challenges with the application of its special feature such as immutability, efficient cryptography, and distributed decentralized storage system. In this paper, we highlighted the technology that enables smart logistics and reviewed smart logistics, Blockchain, and IoT in logistics; we present the significance of integrating Blockchain and IoT in logistics. We proposed a Blockchain-based IoT-enabled system framework for secure and efficient logistics management where logistics data can be captured with the use of IoT sensors, and we also designed and describe the sequence diagram for secured communication between the logistics stakeholder through a smart contract. In conclusion, Blockchain can provide security to logistics data and enhance operational efficiency with its key features.	
1355	协同技术	A secure and efficient data deduplication framework for the internet of things via edge computing and blockchain	Data deduplication can solve the problem of resource wastage caused by duplicated data. However, due to the limited resources of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, applying data deduplication to IoT scenarios is challenging. Existing data deduplication frameworks for the IoT are prone to inefficiency or trust crises due to the random allocation of edge computing nodes. Furthermore, side-channel attacks remain a risk. In addition, after IoT devices store data in the cloud through data deduplication, they cannot share their data efficiently. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient data deduplication framework for the IoT based on edge computing and blockchain technologies. In this scheme, we propose a model based on parallel use of three-layer and two-layer architectures and introduce the RAndom REsponse (RARE) scheme to resist side-channel attacks. We also design a label tree to realise one-to-many data-sharing, which improves efficiency and meets the needs of the IoT. In addition, we use blockchain to resist collusion attacks. Experiments were conducted to demonstrate that our framework has advantages over similar schemes in terms of communication cost, security and efficiency.	data deduplication;blockchain;internet of things;edge computing;data securityside channels;cloud

Our findings suggest that CBDC may not be widely accepted by end users in the presence of a sizable informal economy in which cash is the primary method of payment. CBDC can decrease informality, but this effect becomes weaker in countries with larger informal economies. Tax reduction and CBDC interest rates can be useful tools to promote the adoption and effectiveness of CBDC, leading to a reallocation effect between formal and informal sectors.	central bank digital currency;dsge;informal economybusiness cycles;policy;welfare;money;trend
1358	市场治理	An Assessment of the Impact of Natural Resource Price and Global Economic Policy Uncertainty on Financial Asset Performance: Evidence From Bitcoin	The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of global economic policy uncertainty and natural resource prices, that is, oil prices and gold prices, on Bitcoin returns by using monthly data spanning from May 2013 to December 2021. The study applies ARDL and nonlinear ARDL for evaluating the symmetric and asymmetric effects of Global Economic Uncertainty (GU), oil price (O), and natural gas price on Bitcoin volatility investigated by using the ARCH-GARCH-ERAGCH and non-granger causality test. ARDL model estimation establishes a long-run cointegration between GU, O, G, and Bitcoin. Moreover, GU and oil price exhibits a negative association with Bitcoin and positive influences running from gold price shock to Bitcoin in the long run. NARDL results ascertain the long-run asymmetric relations between GU, oil price, gold price (G), and Bitcoin return. Furthermore, GU's asymmetric effect and positive shock in gold price negatively linked to Bitcoin return in the long run, whereas asymmetric shock in oil price and negative shocks in gold price established a positive linkage with Bitcoin. The results of ARCH effects disclose the volatility persistence in the variables. The causality test reveals that the feedback hypothesis explains the causal effects between GU and Bitcoin and unidirectional causality running from Bitcoin to gold price and oil price to Bitcoin.	global economic uncertainty;bitcoin;oil price;gold price;ardl;nardl;egarch;causalitytime-series;safe haven;unit-root;volatility;hedge;gold;cointegration;hypothesis;aggregate;inference
1359	市场治理	Quantifying Cross-Correlations between Economic Policy Uncertainty and Bitcoin Market: Evidence from Multifractal Analysis	We investigate the dynamic correlation between the Bitcoin price (BTC) and the U.S. economic policy uncertainty index (USEPU) from the perspective of multifractality. Utilizing the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA), we confirm a long-range cross-correlation between BTC and USEPU. Moreover, the empirical results of MF-DCCA show that the power-law properties and multifractal characteristics between BTC and USEPU are significant. We further examine the long-range dependency of cross-correlation between BTC and USEPU series via the Hurst exponent test and confirm the durable cross-correlation. Finally, we introduce another multifractal indicator and examine the extent of multifractality among time series. The empirical results indicate that the BTC series, USEPU series, and the cross-correlation of BTC-USEPU present apparent multifractality, where BTC shows the strongest degree of multifractality.	monetary-policy;price dynamics;chinese stock;crude-oil;volatility;cryptocurrencies;inefficiency;sentiment;forecast;hedge

1361	市场治理	Information Flow between Global Equities and Cryptocurrencies: A VMD-Based Entropy Evaluating Shocks from COVID-19 Pandemic	The world has witnessed the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, it is expected that information transmission between equities and digital assets has been altered due to the hostile impact of the pandemic outbreak on financial markets. As a result, the ensuing perverse risk among markets is presumed to rise during severe uncertainties occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impetus of this study is to examine the degree of asymmetry and nonlinear directional causality between global equities and cryptocurrencies in the frequency domain. Hence, we employ both the variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the Renyi effective transfer entropy techniques. Analyses of the study are presented for three sample periods; these are the full sample period, the pre-COVID-19 period, and the COVID-19 pandemic period. We gauge a mixture of asymmetric and nonlinear bidirectional and unidirectional causality between global equities and cryptocurrencies for the sample periods. However, the COVID-19 pandemic period appears to be driving the estimates for the full sample period, which indicates a negative flow. Thus, the direction and significance of the information flow between the markets for the full sample correspond to the one observed during the COVID-19 pandemic period. We, consequently, establish a significant directional, dynamical, and scale-dependent information flow between global equities and cryptocurrencies. Notwithstanding, throughout the study samples, we mainly find a negative significant information flow from global equities to cryptocurrencies. We detect that most cryptocurrencies exhibit similar behaviour of information flow to global equities for each of the sample periods. The outcome provides pertinent signals to investors with diverse investment horizons who would want to diversify, hedge, or employ cryptocurrencies as a safe haven for global equities during uncertainties, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic.	variational mode decomposition;market returns;time-series;stock;integration;quality;bitcoin
1362	市场治理	Factors Affecting Adaptability of Cryptocurrency: An Application of Technology Acceptance Model	Cryptocurrency has revolutionized the economic system of the world. It provides a new and innovative means of exchange that has speedily invaded the financial market trends and changed the traditional cash world. However, consumers have low acceptability for blockchain-based cryptocurrency due to increasing online scams and the absence of a regulatory framework. There is also a misconception about its usage on many platforms, which has created a clear gap in the literature to address this issue. Therefore, the current study intends to investigate the effect of technology awareness on the behavioral intention of crypto users through perceived factors (usefulness, ease of use, risk). It also empirically examines the moderating role of government support on these indirect paths. The underlying framework is investigated by surveying 333 respondents from the Z generation. Results revealed that perceived factors (usefulness, ease of use, risk) mediate the relationship between technology awareness and behavioral intention. Furthermore, government support strengthens the indirect relationship of technology awareness on behavioral intention through technology acceptance determinants, such that the effect of technology awareness on behavioral intention through perceived factors (usefulness, ease of use, risk) is more assertive when government support is high. The findings will provide a new dimension to different financial bodies implementing monetary policy and highlight the need to adopt innovative digital technologies in Pakistan.	government support;perceived usefulness;perceived ease of use;behavioral intention;perceived risk;technology awareness;technology acceptance modelperceived usefulness;adoption;determinants;intention;people;ease

The apparent desire to access as much information as possible in society makes individuals act compliant and accept privacy policies almost as a matter of course. In the digital age, compliance with the law is not enough; we need to consider the ethical dimension of data processing. But how can organizations behave in the creation of technology projects? The cases of PatientsLikeMe, Clearview or Meta (Fb) will show us problematic scenarios, full of challenges, where we will analyse requirements addressed to organizations and developers aimed at ethical-legal compliance in terms of privacy in the framework of health and technology.	data ethics;digital health;data protection;artificial intelligence;blockchain
1367	实体经济	Blockchain-based multi-skill mobile crowdsourcing services	With the boom in 5G technology, mobile spatial crowdsourcing has shown great dynamism in industrial mobile communications and edge computing node management. But the traditional crowdsourcing system is not advanced enough to adapt to the new environment. Typically, traditional crowdsourcing workflow is hosted by a centralized crowdsourcing platform. However, the centralized crowdsourcing platform faces the following problems: (1) single point of failure, (2) user privacy leakage, (3) subjective arbitration, (4) additional service fee, and (5) non-transparent task assignment process. To improve those problems, we replaced the centralized crowdsourcing platform with a decentralized blockchain infrastructure. And we analyzed the challenge problems of multi-skilled spatial crowdsourcing tasks in the blockchain crowdsourcing system. In addition, a crowdsourcing task allocation algorithm has been proposed, which implements a transparent task distribution process and can adapt to the computing-constrained environment on the blockchain. Compared with the TSWCrowd blockchain-based crowdsourcing model, our system has a higher task allocation rate under the same conditions. And the experimental result shows our work has good economic feasibility, which decentralizes the crowdsourcing process and significantly reduces the additional consumption of the crowdsourcing process.	mobile crowdsourcing;blockchain;spatial communication;smart contract
1368	实体经济	Use of Corporate Disclosures to Identify the Stage of Blockchain Adoption	SYNOPSIS: Several studies have pointed to the transformative effects of blockchain on a wide spectrum of firms, industries, and professions. Despite the arguable consensus within the business community that blockchain will have a real impact on the way firms do business, views diverge when it comes to the timing of diffusion (i.e., when blockchain will achieve mass adoption). We propose that information gathering helps potential adopters form expectations regarding payoffs from blockchain adoption. Information-gathering activities and the resulting information sources, such as web searches, news articles, book titles, and corporate disclosures, can proxy the expectations of potential adopters. Corporate disclosures directly reflect firms' expectations and interests in the new technology. We leverage the corporate disclosure data from the SEC Edgar database to identify the current stage of blockchain adoption. Our analysis shows that while blockchain adoption is still nascent, the focus has been shifting from cryptocurrencies to business applications.	blockchain;technology adoption;corporate disclosures;revealed expectations;textual analysis;topic modelinginformation-technology capability;conference calls;acceptance;reputation;innovation;analysts;price
1369	实体经济	Designing an E-Voting Framework Using Blockchain Technology: A Case Study of Oman	Blockchain technology provides a stable spot in electronic voting systems by providing a transparent platform for an election that prevents the failures faced by the traditional electronic voting systems and makes it a more accurate and secure platform for voting. However, little attention has been paid to the possible impacts of new technological disruptions on politics and the electoral systems. The main goal of this paper is to design a framework for electronic voting systems using blockchain technology. To achieve this goal, the paper outlines these three objectives: (1) to explore and identify the challenges in existing voting systems, (2) to identify the methods that could enhance the security and privacy of the electoral voting systems using blockchain technology, and (3) to design a framework for electronic voting systems that use blockchain technology in order to address the flaws in current voting systems. A mixed approach is applied in this study to explore the opportunities and challenges of the blockchain voting system and design the framework accordingly.	blockchain technology;democracy;e-voting system;hyperledger;oman;swot analysissystem;trust

The existing studies have not yet overcome the crisis characteristics comprehensively and systematically. A traceability system of red jujube is constructed by a hybrid mode of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoTs). The system integrates the blockchain and the IoT technologies with characteristics of tamper-proof, decentralization, and distributed storage and solves the problem of date quality traceability by designing the technical process and architecture of date quality traceability and the big data of red jujube, jujube plantation, processing enterprise, commercial enterprises, and market administration. The whole process from planting to processing and sales of red jujube are recorded in the block to ensure the realization of quality traceability of red dates in the process. Through the whole process of big data processing, the key information collected in each process is stored in the database to ensure the realization of quality traceability of red dates in the framework. The system can help to minimize the production and distribution of unsafe or poor-quality products, thereby minimizing the potential for bad publicity, liability, and recalls.	red jujube quality and safety;traceability system;blockchain;internet of things (iots);quality control systemtraceability;blockchain;challenges;internet
1371	实体经济	In a virtual power plant, a blockchain-based decentralized power management solution for home distributed generation	Introduction of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), including regional renewable resources, energy storage, including controlled applications; has a tremendous disruptive and transformative impact on the centralized power grid. The inclusion of DERs is generally accepted to require a paradigmatic shift to the decentralized power grid with electronic power inverters. Energy has used blockchain technology as a simple payment mechanism for customers; however, it has not improved business process performance. The Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is a potential model for integrating SCRs into the electrical grid. Create a blockchain-based VPP management system throughout this work to allow a diverse set of transitive energy behaviors between home customers in a VPP with renewable, electricity generation, and storage systems. Customers can engage through a VPP to trade energy for mutually beneficial purposes and provide network infrastructure, including power, backup, and smart grids. Develop a decentralized optimization algorithm to improve customer power planning, marketing, and Internet services while respecting their independence and privacy. Then, managing the power of VPP, the researchers create a network of sample blockchain and apply the various algorithms to it. The designers tested the viability and efficiency of our program and blockchain system through tests using actual data. The blockchain-based VPP power management system reduces customer costs up to 39%, also reducing full system costs by 11%, according to modeling results.	elegant grid;blockchain;virtual power plant;energy distribution;energy managementenergy
1372	核心技术	A Privacy Protection Scheme for Cross-Chain Transactions Based on Group Signature and Relay Chain	Recently, with the rapid development of blockchain technology, the information interaction and value transfer problems between different blockchains have become the focus of research. The cross-chain technology is to solve the cross-chain operation problems of assets and data between different chains. However, the existing cross-chain technology has the problem of identity privacy leakage. Therefore, this article proposes a cross-chain privacy protection scheme for consortium blockchains based on group signature, certificate authority, and relay chain. The scheme is divided into three cross-chain service layers, called the management layer, the transaction layer, and the group layer. The management layer is responsible for the forwarding of cross-chain transactions, the transaction layer includes the blockchains that actually participate in cross-chain transactions, and the group layer is responsible for group signature related work. Through this scheme, the identity privacy of both parties to the transaction can be protected during the cross-chain transaction process.	anonymity;blockchain;certificate authority;cross-chain;group signature;identity privacy;relay chain;supervisable

1374	虚拟经济	Asymmetrical herding in cryptocurrency: Impact of COVID 19	This paper examines the evidence of herding in the revolutionary cryptocurrency market for the period from January 2017 to December 2020. The study employs quantile regression technique for investigating herd behaviour during market asymmetries of rising and falling returns, extreme market returns, high volatility, and the exogenous event of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results provide evidence of pronounced herding during the bull phase, extreme down-markets, and high volatility. These results indicate that herd hunch is prevalent in the cryptocurrency market as investors exhibit imitation while ignoring their own knowledge and beliefs. Also, the phenomenon is more vividly observed during the panic period of COVID-19.	cryptocurrency;herding behaviour;cross-sectional absolute deviation;market asymmetry;quantile regressionbehavior;volatility;bitcoin;markets
1375	虚拟经济	The optimisation research of Blockchain application in the financial institution-dominated supply chain finance system	As an information technology that could significantly improve supply chain visibility and process automation, blockchain has been extensively applied in the field of supply chain finance (SCF). However, tradeoffs among the security, the operation cost, and the efficiency of the blockchain system may cause the SCF system dominated by a financial institution to inevitably fall into the dilemmas of risky or un-economic if the blockchain technology is applied inappropriately. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to optimise the blockchain application in the financial institution-based SCF system. We first analyse the application of blockchain security in SCF, and then the performance tradeoffs of blockchain and its impact on the performance of the supported SCF system. Based on the analysis above, an optimisation approach has been proposed and a corresponding non-linear integer programming (NIP) model has been constructed to select the best blockchain design schemes for the SCF system to achieve overall optimal in terms of security, cost, and efficiency. A designed ant colony algorithm is used to solve the optimisation problem. An application case analysis is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the optimisation model.	blockchain application;supply chain finance;optimisation model;ant colony algorithm;nip modeltechnology;benefits;contract

With the huge integration of the Information, Communication and Technology capabilities, the Connected Electric Vehicle (CEV) as a transportation form in cities is becoming more and more efficient and able to reply to citizen and environmental expectations which improve the quality of citizens' life. However, this CEV technological improvement increases the CEV vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks resulting to serious risks for citizens. Thus, they can intensify their negative impact on societies and cause unexpected physical damage and economic losses. This paper targets the cybersecurity issues for CEVs in parking lots where a peer-to-peer(P2P) energy transaction system based on blockchain, and smart contract scheme is launched. A False Data Injection Attack (FDIA) on the electricity price and power signal is proposed and a Machine Learning/SVM classification protocol is used to detect and extract the right values.

1380	核心技术	Distributed Economic Dispatch Based on Finite-Time Double-Consensus Algorithm of Integrated Energy System	To reduce the operating cost and enhance the energy utilization efficiency of the integrated energy system (IES), an economic dispatch algorithm is proposed based on finite-time double-consensus. First, an economic dispatch model of IES under two modes of operation, islanded and grid-connected, is constructed considering energy transmission losses. After that, the optimal improved incremental cost and power output allocation of the IES can be found out in finite time. The proposed algorithm contains two finite-time consistency protocols simultaneously that can solve the optimal values of the incremental cost of electricity and heat of integrated energy system, solving the strong coupling problem of multi-energy systems. The proposed algorithm not only has a faster convergence rate but also enables switching freely between the two operation modes. In addition, a distributed method for quickly discovering the total system power mismatch is proposed in the process of algorithm solving. The finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. Finally, the IES simulation based on the IEEE 30-node power system and the Bali 32-node thermal system is established. The analysis of the simulation results shows that the algorithm proposed in this paper is effective.	distributed economic dispatch;finite time;double-consensus algorithm;double modes of operation;transmission loss;integrated energy systemelectricity;microgrids;internet;heat
1381	实体经济	Event-Based Supply Chain Network Modeling: Blockchain for Good Coffee	Blockchain and distributed ledger technology (BC/DLT) provides distributed databases with decentralized governance, tamper-proof recording, high availability and non-copyable digital assets, which have made it a natural technological basis for supply chain management. In this paper, we introduce REALISTIC, a novel event-based modeling framework for supply chain networks (SCNs) that includes production processes. It extends McCarty's Resources-Events-Agents (REA) accounting model with secure transformations, which, across the entire SCN, guarantee that certified output resources cannot be digitally produced ex nihilo, but require certified input resources of at least the same amount as what is produced. This generalizes the no-double-spend guarantee of current BC/DLT to (digital twins of) physical resources and their production. Authenticated human or robotic Internet of Things (IoT) actors digitally sign and cryptographically commit to the veracity of real-world events on an immutable database, without having to take responsibility for their aggregate consequences. User-specifiable interpretations, corresponding to queries and analytical functions in database systems, provide auditable aggregate information computed from recorded events across the entire SCN. This includes fine-grained and trustworthy tracing of final products through multiple stages of production processes, semi-finished products, quality certifications and transportation all the way back to their raw materials. We present a case study for an end-to-end coffee supply chain that tracks fine-grained and detailed information from a farmer's coffee cherries to retail coffee bags, involving all its actors. Our model handles product provenance; auditable sustainability, quality and trade information; production processes from parchment via green to roasted coffee; product quality tests; farmer certifications; and transportation across the entire coffee supply chain. It is based on field work involving farmers, cooperatives, processors, traders, importers, and a major roasting company stretching from Colombia to Scandinavia. Its REALISTIC-based modeling is the foundation for the design of our prototype implementation, which includes Ethereum blockchain code, RDBMS-based server code and a web app client. Their source code is publicly available on GitHub.	blockchain;coffee;supply chain;event;provenance;certification;sustainabilitysustainability
1382	实体经济	Artificial intelligence and blockchain implementation in supply chains: a pathway to sustainability and data monetisation?	Digitalisation is expected to transform end-to-end supply chain operations by leveraging the technical capabilities of advanced technology applications. Notwithstanding the operations-wise merits associated with the implementation of digital technologies, individually, their combined effect has been overlooked owing to limited real-world evidence. In this regard, this research explores the joint implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology (BCT) in supply chains for extending operations performance boundaries and fostering sustainable development and data monetisation. Specifically, this study empirically studied the tuna fish supply chain in Thailand to identify respective end-to-end operations, observe material and data-handling processes, and envision the implementation of AI and BCT. Therefore, we first mapped the business processes and the system-level interactions to understand the governing material, data, and information flows that could be facilitated through the combined implementation of AI and BCT in the respective supply chain. The mapping results illustrate the central role of AI and BCT in digital supply chains' management, while the associated sustainability and data monetisation impact depends on the parameters and objectives set by the involved system stakeholders. Afterwards, we proposed a unified framework that captures the key data elements that need to be digitally handled in AI and BCT enabled food supply chains for driving value delivery. Overall, the empirically-driven modelling approach is anticipated to support academics and practitioners' decision-making in studying and introducing digital interventions toward sustainability and data monetisation.	supply chain digitalisation;artificial intelligence;blockchain technology;sustainability;data monetisation;fish supply networksseafood traceability;big data;management;design;future;quality;technology;challenges;logistics;framework

A regulatory anticounterfeiting traceability metamodel based on blockchain in the supply chain is constructed. Combined with the data of the supply chain system of a rice processing enterprise, a case study is carried out. The anticounterfeiting and traceability supervision metamodel based on the blockchain can be well applied to the rice supply chain system; solve the problems of data privacy encryption, secure storage, and authority management in the rice supply chain; and realize the interconnection and effective supervision of supply chain information. For enterprises in different positions in the supply chain, a unified anticounterfeiting traceability platform is established through the model, which can provide security and privacy protection for all kinds of enterprise data at the same time; for consumers, the model meets the security and traceability of each data of purchasing goods and ensures the integrity and authenticity of the data.

Then, taxonomy has been built to group articles according to their motivations, objectives, and challenges. The search has been conducted in four major databases: IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Springer, and PubMed. The final sets were included 54. Most articles (22 out of 54) about blood bank systems: computer and mobile-based blood bank systems(13), blood donor searching systems(5), and Internet of Things-based blood banks(4). Reviews (12 out of 54) have discussed the importance of smart technologies in blood donations. Studies (15 out of 54) have included various analyses about inventory issues with blood/platelet supply chain networks problems in disasters. Meanwhile, few articles (5) have presented devices to detect blood groups and measure viscosity in an easy, cost-effective way. This work also has provided an overview of the recent contributions in blood banks mechanisms from 2017 to 2021 facilitating the donation in difficult situations, monitoring blood inventory. Besides, has highlighted the weaknesses in medical care techniques in developing countries suffering from disasters, diseases, and wars. On the other hand, how some limitations in such applications need to take more seriously ex: security, and privacy, older people may face problems in operating, as well as internet and power connectivity which are the main worries. We anticipate that this systematic review can help other researchers grasp the available concepts and gaps so that they can subsequently add to this type of research.	blood bank;blood donors;blood transfusion;internet of things;smart blood bank systemshealth-care;management
1386	实体经济	Unified Authentication and Access Control for Future Mobile Communication-Based Lightweight IoT Systems Using Blockchain	The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new revolution defined by heterogeneous devices made up of intelligent, omnipresent items that are all hooked up to The internet. These devices are frequently implemented in different areas to offer innovative programs in various industrial applications, including intelligent urban, medicine, and societies. Such Internet of Things (IoT) equipment generates a large volume of private and safety information. Because IoT systems are resource-constrained in terms of operation, memory, and communication capability, safeguarding accessibility to them is a difficult task In the blockchain concept, the majority, or even all network nodes, check the validity and accuracy of exchanged data before accepting and recording it, whether this data is related to financial transactions, measurements of a sensor, or an authentication message. In evaluating the validity of exchanged data, nodes must reach a consensus in order to perform a special action, in which case the opportunity to enter and record transactions and unreliable interactions with the system is significantly reduced. Recently, in order to share and access management of IoT devices' information with a distributed attitude, a new authentication protocol based on blockchain has been proposed, and it is claimed that this protocol satisfies user privacy while preserving security. Today's identification and authentication techniques have substantial shortcomings due to rapidly growing prevalence and implementation. As a result, the protection of such gadgets is critical to guarantee the program's efficacy and safety. A decentralized authentication and access control method for lightweight IoT systems are proposed in this work and a blockchain-based system that enables identification and secures messaging with IoT nodes. The technique is built on fog information systems and the idea of a blockchain system; when contrasted to something like a blockchain-based verification system, the testing findings show that the suggested mechanism outperforms it. The authentication and verification system undergoes using the blockchain technique. Our method takes advantage of blockchain's inherent advantages while also associated with development authentication systems. Our suggested blockchain-based approach, structure, and layout, in particular, provide for transparency, consistency, and provenance while also providing tamper-proof records. The article describes the general systems architectural style and the analysis and execution of a real scenario as just a prototype system. The authentication included give as protected prototype that can transmit data with secured protocol and achieves minimum error rate.

On the basis of summarizing and analyzing the previous published literatures, this study expounded the research status and significance of public administration and resource allocations; elaborated the development background, current status and future challenges of blockchain, and structured occupational therapy; introduced the methods and principles of data quality collaboration model and multiparty collaboration standard management; analyzed the case background of public administration and resource allocation in the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic; discussed the public administration mechanism based on blockchain and structured occupational therapy; established a resource allocation method based on blockchain and structured occupational therapy; fathomed the role of the distributed ledger established by blockchain to increase the information symmetry of public administration activities; proposed a blockchain-established special machine trust for resource allocation; and finally, anatomized the data security sharing and access control mechanism based on blockchain and structured occupational therapy. The research results show that the public administration and resource allocation in this paper can effectively realize the data integration of the whole process and all departments and show the whole data and realize the traceability of the whole process. The blockchain revolutionizes the hierarchical leadership method of traditional resource allocation, shortens the distance between superiors and subordinates, makes information dissemination more fluent, and handles things more efficiently, making resource allocation ultimately form a flatter organization structure. In the original trust system of resource allocation, the blockchain and structured occupational therapy realizes the reconstruction of the trust system by preventing information tampering, using information encryption technology, and using information traceability technology. The results of this paper provide a reference for further research on the public administration and resource allocation based on blockchain and structured occupational therapy.	sector organizations;management
1388	实体经济	Application Value Evaluation of Blockchain Technology in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Information Platform for College Students	The current collegiate innovation and entrepreneurship information network works in a centralized manner, and there is a centralized trust dilemma. Malicious administrators can use their own rights to achieve public and private purposes. To solve this problem, a blockchain technology based on decentralization was introduced into the innovation as well as an entrepreneurship information platform for college students. It is critical to understand how to assess the usefulness of blockchain in innovation and entrepreneurship information platforms. This research mixes it with the current popular artificial intelligence trend and offers a neural network to assess the value of blockchain technology in terms of creativity and as an entrepreneurship information platform. The contents are as follows: (1) an application value evaluation method with an improved residual neural network is proposed. First, an improved data pooling layer is constructed by using three consecutive convolutional layers in series. The approach then has a significant feature learning ability by increasing the receptive field, thanks to an atrous residual block that combines atrous convolution and the residual block. Finally, the dropout method is introduced to avoid the negative impact of overfitting. (2) An application value evaluation method based on skip connection and residual network is proposed. With the inception module, this method creates a better data pooling layer and adds residual connections. The skip connection line is built in the residual block, which improves the residual block's learning efficiency for feature information. The ordinary convolution in the residual block with a skip connection line is replaced with atrous convolution, and an atrous residual block with a skip connection line is designed. Finally, to construct a neural network, the two designed leftover blocks are connected end-to-end.	education;system
1389	实体经济	Analysis of the Impact of Blockchain and Internet of Things (BIoT) on Public Procurement	Most countries in the world are currently faced with a series of public procurement challenges. Moreover, the large volumes of public procurement and the impact it may have of the global economy, the environment and the society at large justify a research study aimed at achieving sustainable and smart procurement. Smart public procurement intensively relies on emerging technologies and it is both an international priority and a challenge to achieve it. This paper is aimed at addressing such procurement-specific challenges. This study reflects the current status and the trends in public procurement, as well as the manner in which Blockchain and the Internet of Things (BIoT) may lead to a beneficial change in the field. In order to analyse the impact of BIoT, we are putting forward an assessment model comprising the definition and the description of six hypotheses. They are validated both by reference to the current knowledge status and via the analysis of the data collected in a survey which was conducted in Romania. It was aimed at collecting and analysing the data from the main stakeholders as well as at formulating recommendations/actions related to the modernisation of the current system. The study uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to validate the proposed model and to establish the relationships between the adoption of BIoT and smart, sustainable and transparent public procurement. At the same time, we analyse the links between the adoption of BIoT and aspects such as corruption and fraud, the challenges related to technological integration and the need to reengineer organisations, as well as national and international policies. Following our analyses, there emerged that BIoT adoption has a positive impact on the achievement of sustainable public procurement processes (the highest effect), on transparency and the trust in public procurement, on reducing corruption and fraud in public procurement and on the achievement of smart public procurement. The paper provides theoretical and practical contributions that should support solutions to the current major challenges and represent a vehicle for innovation and sustainable development alike.	procurement;blockchains;sustainable development;market research;internet of things;europe;artificial intelligence;blockchain technology;internet of things;green public procurement;public procurement 40;smart contracts;smart public procurement;structural equation modeling;sustainable public procurementsmart contracts;iot;selection
1390	实体经济	Blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control for resilient individualised manufacturing towards Industry 5.0	The production control for the mass individualisation paradigm of R&D-stage products is challenging due to the mix-flow and frequently-disturbed environment. With the convergence of the sustainable development goals and the increasing individualised demands in products, resilient manufacturing is envisioned in Industry 5.0 proposition. Concerning that conventional centralised production control methods suffer from low stability and inefficiency of decisions under frequent disruptions, this paper establishes a blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control (BSCP-MAAPC) approach for improving the timeliness and adaptability of control towards resilient individualised manufacturing. Firstly, a blockchain-based multi-agent system architecture is designed based on agent encapsulation of manufacturing units. Blockchained smart contracts are used as the enabler of the multi-agent system for peer-to-peer negotiation and coordination of tasks. Secondly, a quad-play blockchained smart contract pyramid together with a series of decentralised control patterns are designed to enable the initial task dispatching of various individualised demands, as well as rapid dynamic adjustment of schedule in response to internal random disruptions. Finally, a blockchained smart contract pyramid-driven multi-agent autonomous process control system prototype is built in the ManuChain system, and experiments are conducted to analyze the proposed BSCP-MAAPC approach in different environments.	autonomous process control;multi-agent system;smart contract;resilient individualised manufacturing;industry 5;0design;system;optimization;network;intelligence;consensus
1391	实体经济	A Secure Decentralized Spatial Crowdsourcing Scheme for 6G-Enabled Network in Box	Due to the safe portability of the device in sixth generation (6G) enabled network in box (NIB) and the mobility of locations, users equipped with the device can have a better experience in spatial crowdsourcing. The integration of NIB with 6G results in a decentralized spatial crowdsourcing in industrial automation, but threatens the security of tasks and answers and also leads to the leakage of sensing nodes' locations. To address these problems, in this article, we propose a secure decentralized spatial crowdsourcing scheme for 6G-enabled NIB (DSC-NIB). Using DSC-NIB, the control station and sensing nodes can gather and transmit information on the blockchain using NIB, without depending on the third party. The control station shares encrypted location strategy parameters set to negotiate session keys and a group key with sensing nodes whose locations satisfy the location strategy, while ensuring the privacy of sensing nodes' locations. For the security of tasks and answers, we leverage the Counter with CBC-MAC authenticated encryption mechanism to provide confidentiality and integrity. Furthermore, we analyze the security of the proposed DSC-NIB. Compared with existing approaches, the performance is evaluated and improved by 30--50%. To further optimize the performance, two optimized schemes without sacrificing security are presented and our results demonstrate that performance is improved greatly.	sensors;task analysis;security;crowdsourcing;integrated circuits;6g mobile communication;cryptography;industrial automation;network in box (nib);security;spatial crowdsourcing;sixth generation (6g)

The images and feature vector sets are then stored by IPFS (inter-planetary file system). When a consumer needs to authenticate a ceramic product, it is only necessary to take a microscopic image of the specified location, and then the SIFT algorithm will compare the picture with the data stored in the IPFS network, previously obtained through the records on a blockchain network. The matching result then determines whether the photographed ceramic is one of those already recorded. Experimental results show that the matching results can be used as a strong basis for identifying the origin of ceramic products.	blockchain;ceramic identification;ceramic products;feature extraction;image matching;ipfs network;microscopic image;sift algorithmthermoluminescence

In this study, we study the construction mode of e-commerce agricultural product online marketing system based on the end of blockchain and improved genetic algorithm. This study adopts the design idea of coalition chain and proposes a multichain agricultural product trading information blockchain application technology including agricultural product trading information chain, user information chain, and agricultural product information chain. The agricultural product information chain provides detailed information of agricultural products and ensures the traceability and non-tamperability of the information. It automatically divides the profits of transactions through smart contracts to improve execution efficiency and reduce transaction costs and finally establishes a transparent, efficient, and applicable blockchain architecture for agricultural product transactions.	
1394	实体经济	CEV Framework: A Central Bank Digital Currency Evaluation and Verification Framework With a Focus on Consensus Algorithms and Operating Architectures	We propose a Central Bank Digital Currency Evaluation and Verification (CEV) Framework for recommending and verifying technical solutions in the central bank digital currency (CBDC) system. We demonstrate two sub-frameworks: an evaluation sub-framework that provides consensus algorithm and operating architecture solutions and a verification sub-framework that validates the proposed solutions. Our framework offers a universal CBDC solution that is compatible with different national economic and regulatory regimes. The evaluation sub-framework generates customized solutions by splitting the consensus algorithms into several components and analyzing their impacts on CBDC systems. CBDC design involves a trade-off between system features - the consensus algorithm cannot achieve all system features simultaneously. However, we also improve the operating architectures to compensate for the weak system features. The verification sub-framework helps verify our proposed solution through empirical experiments and formal proof. Our framework offers CBDC designers the flexibility to iteratively tune the trade-off between CBDC system features for the desired solution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a framework to recommend and verify CBDC technical solutions.	consensus algorithm;business;blockchains;privacy;online banking;scalability;licenses;central bank digital currency;evaluation sub-framework;consensus algorithm;operating architectures;verification sub-framework

1396	实体经济	Efficient and Secure Cross-Domain Sharing of Blockchain Electronic Medical Records Based on Edge Computing	In this article, we analysed the problems of electronic medical records (EMRs) and found that the EMRs generated by different hospitals for the same patient are mutually independent and duplication and data sharing are difficult among hospitals. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes an efficient and secure cross-domain sharing scheme of EMRs based on edge computing. The program allows the doctor to access the personal history EMRs through the patient's authorization so that the doctor can understand the patient's history of illness and, on this basis, generate a new medical record for the patient. Then, the doctor sends the EMRs to the edge server, and the server calculates the ciphertext and adds it to the patient's personal medical record to complete the case update. Analysis shows that this solution can effectively prevent data tampering and forgery through blockchain and avoid privacy leakage problems in plaintext sharing by using searchable encryption and by relying on edge servers to solve nearby computing tasks and divert the computing capacity of cloud servers to improve efficiency. The security proof shows that the scheme satisfies the complex problem of the BDH assumption. Performance analysis shows that the scheme is feasible and efficient.	health records
1397	协同技术	A Blockchain-Enabled Trusted Identifier Co-Governance Architecture for the Industrial Internet of Things	Recently, the Industrial Internet of Things plays a vital role in the new round of technology innovation and industry competition, where the identity resolution system is its key component. However, there are some problems in the existing Handle-based identity resolution architecture. Therefore, a trusted identifier co-governance architecture is proposed, and a prototype system is designed and implemented in this article. Specifically, we design a blockchain-based decentralized framework for identifier service, identifier life cycle management based on smart contract, and a data storage mechanism for a trusted identifier. The whole architecture could solve the problems of single point of failure, data tampering, and governance deviation, and reduce the trust cost in the process of data circulation. The simulation results reveal that the system has achieved good results in terms of delay and throughput.	systems

This critical engagement with enthusiasts, sceptics and pragmatists through the different stages may help to present a more realistic picture of DLT/blockchain's potential from a legal perspective in the short and medium term.

With this digital world, the money also changes its faces from paper money to digital currency called cryptocurrency without any central bank, which runs on top of the technology called blockchain. The trendiest cryptocurrency is bitcoin. Forecasting the daily price is a challenging task due to its nonlinearity. Most of the researchers tried to predict using various statistical and machine learning models which were not satisfactory because of its large dataset with more noise. The intention is to design a deep learning multiplicative long short-term memory model to estimate the price of bitcoin with an attention mechanism using technical indicators which gives better accuracy and a very less error rate. The proposed model is compared with some existing models, say long short-term memory, peephole, gated recurrent unit and multiplicative long short-term memory on the presence and absence of technical indicators. The comparative result shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing models in terms of mean square error, root mean square error and mean absolute error when evaluated with two benchmark datasets.	cryptocurrency;bitcoin price prediction;bitcoin;deep learning;technical indicator;attention mechanism;multiplicative lstmvolatility;networks;index;root
1400	核心技术	Design and implementation of NDN-based Ethereum blockchain	Blockchain technology allows public parties to agree on a common state without relying on a central authority. Despite it brings many innovative use cases, the technology is still in its early stage that needs improving on many aspects. One of the issues is to deliver blockchain data more efficiently. Named Data Networking (NDN), a new network paradigm, is designed to make content distribution with ease by enabling in-network caching and built-in multicasting, which blockchain technologies can take advantage. Moreover, blockchain may contribute to extending NDN application ecosystems including decentralized applications. Therefore, it is instrumental to have a working blockchain system that runs on NDN platform to supports its research and development. In this work, we design and implement an NDN-based Ethereum blockchain platform. We propose new protocols for propagating blockchain data making full use of NDN features for the delivery of transactions and blocks. Our experiments show that the distribution of blockchain data in NDN is more efficient than that of IP network. The latency of block delivery is also reduced, which in turn supports tuning blockchain parameter for better security. Our developed blockchain client is freely distributed as an open-source project. We hope that it can provide a platform to foster blockchain research on NDN in the future.	blockchain;ethereum;p2p;icn;ndn
1401	实体经济	Towards blockchain-IoT based shared mobility: Car-sharing and leasing as a case study	The shared mobility concept is seen as disruptive and transformative for the automotive industry. Shared mobility is changing the way we choose our travel mode, from just owning a car to e-hailing, car-sharing, and other relevant mobility solutions. There is a growing interest of car manufacturers (original equipment manufacturers or OEMs) in car-sharing as an expansion strategy. Similarly, blockchain technology is seen as another disruptive technology, which can potentially change how the data is stored and accessible via its immutable, transparent, and trustworthy features. Motivated by these two current trends, this paper aims to explore how blockchain and IoT technologies together can drive shared mobility forward. We have presented a high-level architecture for a blockchain-IoT-based platform for promoting shared mobility combining car-sharing and car-leasing. We also demonstrated a prototype implemented from the OEM's point of view by developing a blockchain-IoT-based platform streamlining car-sharing and leasing processes by taking into consideration of primary stakeholders (such as OEMs, a peer-to-peer car-sharing provider, leasing company and insurance provider as well as public authorities). This work also demonstrates that the design of such an integrated platform depends on the right balance between the key design principles (such as security and privacy, authenticity, traceability and reliability, scalability, and interoperability) in the context of car-sharing platforms.	blockchain;car-sharing;car-leasing;distributed ledger technologies;hyperledger fabric;internet-of-things;shared mobilitypreferences;services
1402	核心技术	Toward Reliable and Confidential Release for Smart Contract via ID-Based TRE	The concept of time release provides a new mode of sending information to the future, where the message will be available after a certainly specified period. Time-release encryption (TRE), as a promising approach, has a widespread releasing application and ensures data confidentiality. TRE relies on two main frameworks, one based on the time-lock puzzle and the other based on a trusted third party, while this primitive is impeded by frameworks' unreliability limitations and time disclosure. We present ReleaseSC, a decentralized and privacy-aware system that combines smart contract with TRE. ReleaseSC leverages a novel three-part architecture that harmonizes time release and contracts, enabling efficient time-hidden smart contract. Our prototype is with reasonable performance through EVM evaluations on both private chain and official test network. ReleaseSC is built on the top of a new cryptographic notion named ID-based TRE that supports a flexible time policy and preserves the to-be-released time. We propose an ID-based TRE instantiation and show rigorous security analysis in formal security models. The insight from ReleaseSC will open more possibilities to address security issues in hybridized cryptography-blockchain systems.	blockchains;cryptography;smart contracts;reliability;peer-to-peer computing;encryption;receivers;identity-based encryption (ibe);smart contract;time privacy;time-release encryption (tre)identity-based encryption
1403	核心技术	A New Approach to Constructing Decentralized Identifier for Secure and Flexible Key Rotation	Owing to the introduction of blockchain (BC) technology, a decentralized identity (DID) model has been proposed to replace conventional identity models based on centralized authorities. The BC platform operated by various participants provides a new root-of-trust functionality for entity identification and access control. Each entity generates and registers its own identifier and credential (public key) to the BC such that any entity can obtain the other entity's public key. When the corresponding private key is compromised, the key rotation to generate and register a new key pair should be performed. However, the current approach for cryptographically binding a decentralized identifier with a public key induces a serious security problem that results in both identity-stealing attacks and multiple identifiers for a single entity. A new DID to address the security problem above is proposed herein, which is based on a newly proposed cryptographic primitive (infinite one-way hash chain), as well as its security analysis and performance evaluation on Hyperledger Fabric and Contiki Cooja simulator. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed DID to various security protocols, an authenticated key exchange protocol is also designed.	security;cryptography;internet of things;blockchains;smart contracts;registers;performance evaluation;blockchain (bc);decentralized identity (did);hyperledger fabric;identity-stealing attack;infinite one-way hash chain;key rotation;root-of-trustauthentication;internet
1404	核心技术	Attribute-Based Private Data Sharing With Script-Driven Programmable Ciphertext and Decentralized Key Management in Blockchain Internet of Things	In this article, we address the problem of secure sensitive data sharing for the specified recipients in Blockchain Internet of Things (BIoT). To do it, we present a cryptographic solution to meet the requirements of decentralization and convenience through key management and programmable ciphertext. First, we design a new ciphertext-policy decentralized-key attribute-based encryption (CP-DK-ABE) scheme. After the master secret key is shared into all full nodes in the form of threshold secret sharing, a decentralized multiparty computation protocol is used to generate the user's private key in an interactive way. Meanwhile, the attribute subkeys associated with the private key can be reconstructed by obtaining a fragment from each of full nodes, so as to achieve the cooperative management of attribute key through all of full nodes. Furthermore, following the blockchain's script system, we introduce five new opcodes to represent ciphertext in the programmable format. Such a mechanism provides flexible capability to represent the logical relationship of the access control policy among attribute subciphers in the CP-DK-ABE ciphertext by the scripting language. As a result, the processes of encryption and decryption are implemented entirely by the script interpreter on the blockchain node, thereby greatly improving the convenience of programming in BIoT devices. In addition, we prove that the proposed CP-DK-ABE scheme is key private and semantically secure for a limited number of corrupted full nodes under the decisional linear and bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption, respectively.	encryption;blockchains;cryptography;internet of things;authorization;hospitals;cardiology;attribute-based encryption (abe);blockchain internet of things (biot);decentralized key;programmable ciphertext;script systemencryption;hidden
1405	实体经济	Blockchain Technology: The Role of Integrated Reverse Supply Chain Networks in Sustainability	This research explores the role of Blockchain Technology (BCT) integrated with Reverse Supply Chain Networks (RSCN) and evaluates the relationship between BCT and sustainability performance. A qualitative research design was employed to develop a conceptual framework for BCT in RSCN. This research collected and analysed primary and secondary data from four cases as focal-actors. These focal-actors are from multi-industries in Jordan, namely food, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and toys. These actors are lead-firms and have experience working with RSCNs and technology applications such as BCT. Primary data were acquired from interviews with managers working in these industries, which were supported by the analysis of secondary data that identified two types of themes: internally focused and externally focused BCT-integrated drivers of RSCNs. The analysis also identified how they leverage sustainability performance improvements, including their use of RSCN approaches and features. This research is one of the few attempts to explore BCT integrated into RSCN for better sustainability performance that contributes to the theoretical and practical knowledge of supply chains within emerging economies. All types of actors-as-stakeholders involved with national programs and projects can adopt the new framework. The key findings contribute to the field of RSCN where the adoption of BCT as a broad-based strategy to attain sustainability goals and reverse chain activities along the supply chain is a goal.	blockchain technology;reverse supply chain networks;sustainability performance;multi-industries;emerging economy

We present a number of attack scenarios and potential vulnerabilities of the protocol and introduce a number of additional features which enhance its resilience. Specifically, a blacklisting algorithm, which is based on a reputation-weighted threshold, is introduced to handle both spamming and multirate malicious attackers. A solidification request component is also introduced to ensure the fairness and consistency of the network in the presence of attacks. Finally, a timestamp component is also introduced to maintain the consistency of the network in the presence of multirate attackers. Simulations to illustrate the efficacy and robustness of the revised protocol are also presented.	access control;blockchains;internet of things;distributed ledger;protocols;computer architecture;peer-to-peer computing;distributed ledger technology;efficient communications and networking;network architecture;security and privacyblockchain;internet;system

As an integration of satellite systems and terrestrial communications, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) provides a reliable and efficient way for LBS. But the privacy protection in SAGIN cannot meet LBS security requirements well, so we present a blockchain-based LBS security preserving trust model. K-anonymous location privacy protection algorithm is used to hide users' real position so that users can avoid personal privacy disclosure when requesting LBSs. We propose a trust management algorithm which can detect the malicious behaviors when constructing anonymous regions and clear the malicious users out of the system. Besides, we use blockchain to implement the transparency and conditional anonymity of the system. Missive experiments indicate that our scheme is feasible and outperforms part of state-of-the-art privacy protection approaches.	blockchain-based trust model;location-based service (lbs);privacy security;space-air-ground integrated network (sagin);vehicle ad hoc network (vanet)reputation;architecture;technology;challenges;safety

As the combination of blockchain and Health IoT could potentially address these two limitations, it has attracted significant interest. However, blockchain-based systems often fail to balance data sharing and privacy protection. Therefore, we proposed a Health IoT-based privacy-preserving data sharing blockchain system. We designed a privacy-preserving method based on the content extraction signature scheme to enable patients to establish fine-grained privacy protection. We designed a Byzantine fault-tolerant leader election mechanism that enhances the security of the Raft algorithm while providing efficiency in the data sharing. Furthermore, we designed a summary contract to ensure efficient data retrieval. The proposed mechanism was evaluated in terms of the efficiency and security. The simulation and analysis results demonstrate that our scheme offers a secure and effective technique for achieving privacy-preserving and efficient sharing of IoT medical data.	blockchain;data sharing;healthcare;internet of things (iot);privacy-preserving;raft algorithm
1412	实体经济	SmHeSol (IoT-BC): Smart Healthcare Solution for Future Development Using Speech Feature Extraction Integration Approach with IoT and Blockchain	Voice of any human plays an important role in communication and sharing information among each other. Through voice, internal behavior can be identified as to whether the person is happy or angry which is reflected. A person's behavior is not exactly reflected by their face; variation in his/her voice reflects somehow their behavior as there will be variation in voice and variation in frequency and pitch. Feelings and natural behaviors are important features, and there are many biological aspects through which they can be identified. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a Hindi speech specimen of different groups to identify the person's behavior and natural feelings under different acoustic conditions. Many research papers show emotion recognition based on neural networks with different models using speech signals to identify the present status of any patient, and it helps to build a way for a smart healthcare system. Enabling service in terms of Blockchain means the sufferer does not require communicating with complex and failed tasks for collecting information from various sources to send to their expert. Blockchain provides experts access to systems and enables entry to the dataset section. Patients have total control over their data, and they no longer require monitoring to keep their data managed and up to date. Also, manually coordinating with data is required for multiple visitors, which can be a very tedious one. In this paper, we focused on feature removal of speech using different extraction approaches which were used to know the quality or state of voice specimens and also understand which feature extraction plays a vital role in gaining a close state of speech. Internet of Things-based learning platforms are used to gather the voice sample, and also, a deep gaining method was followed to reach and achieve the best accuracy and identify the error rate which will help to gather close behavior and state of mind. Finally, a proposed model based on the Gaussian mixture model as a classifier was used for its spotting and attestation.	independent speaker identification;convolutional neural-networks;emotion recognition;data augmentation;technologies;architecture;framework
1413	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Trust Management Framework for Cloud Computing-Based Internet of Medical Things (IoMT): A Systematic Review	The internet of medical things (IoMT) is a smart medical device structure that includes apps, health services, and systems. These medical equipment and applications are linked to healthcare systems via the internet. Because IoT devices lack computational power, the collected data can be processed and analyzed in the cloud by more computationally intensive tools. Cloud computing in IoMT is also used to store IoT data as part of a collaborative effort. Cloud computing has provided new avenues for providing services to users with better user experience, scalability, and proper resource utilization compared to traditional platforms. However, these cloud platforms are susceptible to several security breaches evident from recent and past incidents. Trust management is a crucial feature required for providing secure and reliable service to users. The traditional trust management protocols in the cloud computing situation are centralized and result in single-point failure. Blockchain has emerged as the possible use case for the domain that requires trust and reliability in several aspects. Different researchers have presented various blockchain-based trust management approaches. This study reviews the trust challenges in cloud computing and analyzes how blockchain technology addresses these challenges using blockchain-based trust management frameworks. There are ten (10) solutions under two broad categories of decentralization and security. These challenges are centralization, huge overhead, trust evidence, less adaptive, and inaccuracy. This systematic review has been performed in six stages: identifying the research question, research methods, screening the related articles, abstract and keyword examination, data retrieval, and mapping processing. Atlas.ti software is used to analyze the relevant articles based on keywords. A total of 70 codes and 262 quotations are compiled, and furthermore, these quotations are categorized using manual coding. Finally, 20 solutions under two main categories of decentralization and security were retrieved. Out of these ten (10) solutions, three (03) fell in the security category, and the rest seven (07) came under the decentralization category.	architecture;scheme;taxonomy;secure
1414	实体经济	AI-Driven Data Monetization: The Other Face of Data in IoT-Based Smart and Connected Health	As the trajectory of the Internet of Things (IoT) moving at a rapid pace and with the rapid worldwide development and public embracement of wearable sensors, these days, most companies and organizations are awash in massive amounts of data. Determining how to profit from data deluge can give companies an edge in the market because data have the potential to add tremendous value to many aspects of a business. The market has already seen a level of monetization across vertical domains in the form of layering connected devices with a variety of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) choices, such as subscription plans or smart device insights. Out of this arena is evolving a "machine economy" in which the ability to correctly monetize data rather than simply hoard it, will provide a significant advantage in a competitive digital environment. The recent advent of the technological advances in the fields of big data, analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new avenues of competition, where data are utilized strategically and treated as a continuously changing asset able to unleash new revenue opportunities for monetization. Such growth has made room for an onslaught of new tools, architectures, business models, platforms, and marketplaces that enable organizations to successfully monetize data. In fact, emerging business models are striving to alter the power balance between users and companies that harvest information. Start-ups and organizations are offering to sell user data to data analytics companies and other businesses. Monetizing data goes beyond just selling data. It is also possible to include steps that add value to data. Generally, organizations can monetize data by: 1) utilizing it to make better business decisions or improve processes; 2) surrounding flagship services or products with data; or 3) selling information to current or new markets. This article will address all important aspects of IoT data monetization with more focus on the healthcare industry and discuss the corresponding challenges, such as data management, scalability, regulations, interoperability, security, and privacy. In addition, it presents a holistic reference architecture for the healthcare data economy with an in-depth case study on the detection and prediction of cardiac anomalies using multiparty computation (MPC) and privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) techniques.	internet of things;companies;data privacy;hospitals;artificial intelligence (ai);big data;blockchain;ehealth;healthcare;internet of things (iot)ehealth promises;challenges;care

1416	实体经济	Information Competition in Disruptive Media Markets: Investigating Competition and User Selection on Google	Due to digitization, traditional media brands are facing hypercompetition. For one thing, media outlets offering journalistic content no longer compete just with each other but also with all sorts of content from various sources, such as corporate publishers. This particularly applies to the information space provided by Google and other search engines. This leads to the question of how traditional media brands prevail in this information space: do traditional media brands have a competitive advantage because users perceive their journalistic content as more valuable in terms of credibility and reputation? Accordingly, this study investigates competition and user selection on Google. Drawing on a representative, experimental selection study of the German-speaking Swiss population (N = 1,100), search engine selection behavior was investigated. Results show that selection preferences do not differ between traditional media brands and other competitors, such as corporate publishers. This poses a major challenge for media brands. However, credibility and reputation significantly influence selection preferences. Thus, media managers should focus on effective branding activities in order to maintain a strong position in the digital information market.	media markets;competition;media brands;user selection;competitive information space;blockchainnews media;online information;credibility;internet;web;overload;position;quality;brands;states
1417	核心技术	Network Blockchain Security Sharing Model Based on Fuzzy Logic	In light of the continuous development of Internet technology, many problems involving network security based on the blockchain have also been observed gradually. In this paper, the existence forms of network security hazards based on the blockchain are explored to establish a network blockchain security sharing model based on fuzzy logic. In security sharing, network blockchains are often maintained by many parties. This poses new potential threats and challenges to privacy protection in these multiparty network blockchains. This paper proposes a research scheme for a network blockchain security sharing model based on fuzzy logic. The tampering of the protected network blockchain is prevented by blockchain, and the fuzzy logic algorithm is used to ensure its confidentiality. This solution allows the exchange in the protected network blockchain and the security of transaction information based on the fuzzy logic algorithm. According to the results of the experiments, this method can ensure security sharing of the network blockchain with high practicality and achieve the expected design effect.	neural-network
1418	实体经济	An efficient auditing scheme with a novel structure for multiple replicas	The rapid development of cloud storage encourages more and more users to store data onto the cloud. To improve the availability of data services, users usually use multiple replicas technology to store data. Therefore, the integrity verification and dynamic updates of multiple replicas are very critical for users. In this paper, we design an efficient auditing scheme for a novel structure of multiple replicas. The scheme introduces blockchain technology to generate random and undeniable challenge messages, users only need to perform batch verification on auditing results from the third-party auditor (TPA) to confirm the integrity of multiple replicas of data in the cloud, which prevents malicious TPA from forging auditing results. Besides, sharing a dynamic structure of multiple replicas files reduces storage overhead, the average performance of dynamic updates is O(1). This scheme allows batch verification of any number of replicas of multiple users, which improves auditing efficiency significantly. Moreover, when batch auditing fails, damaged data files can be found by using the recursive performance of the Lucas sequence. Security analysis presents that the security of this scheme is trustworthy. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our design can achieve efficient dynamic updates and batch auditing.	multiple replicas;blockchain technology;dynamic updates;batch auditingdata possession

However, there are some issues that need to be solved in EBSN: (1) The online static data could not satisfy the online dynamic recommendation demand; (2) the implicit behavior information tends to be ignored, reducing the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm; and (3) the online recommendation description is inconsistent with the offline activity. To address these issues, an Incentive Improved DQN (IIDQN) based on Deep Q-Learning Networks (DQN) is proposed. More specifically, we introduce the agents to interact with the environment through online dynamic data. Furthermore, we consider two types of implicit behavior information: the length of the user's browsing time and the user's implicit behavior factors. As for the problem of inconsistency, based on blockchain technology, a new activities event approach on EBSN is proposed, where all activities are recorded on the chain. Finally, the simulation results indicate that the IIDQN algorithm greatly outperforms in mean rewards and recommendation performance than before DQN.

At scale-up phases, farmers also generate tremendous amounts of data that might have privacy and ownership concerns. There remains the possibility of a better way to integrate PA data continent-wide in Africa. Data privacy and ownership issues must be addressed while still maintaining the integration of PA data at scale. The objective of this paper is to review the major challenges of PA data harmonization in Africa and discuss the existing opportunities in relation to technological advancements in PA data applications to address data sharing without compromising data privacy, ownership, and stewardship. Finally, a new PA data sharing and reward model-'PrecisioNexion' is proposed to rationalize data network systems by establishing a robust and self-sustaining business model. The model uses AI and blockchain technology to track and stamp PA data using unique dataset_IDs or PrecisionPrint (like a fingerprint), determining credit amounts using 'pVouchers' (like eVouchers) and distributing credits between PA data owners or 'PrecisionProprietor', data clients or 'PrecisionClient' and funders or 'PrecisionPatron'. The proposed system provides a foundation for win-win-win PA data sharing and self-sustaining business models for data owners, technology solutions providers and funders, while ensuring a strong partnership between farmers' cooperatives, private sector, scientists, governments, and financial institutions, and countries.	precision agriculture;data;ai;blockchainsoil;fusion
1423	实体经济	BCST-APTS: Blockchain and CP-ABE Empowered Data Supervision, Sharing, and Privacy Protection Scheme for Secure and Trusted Agricultural Product Traceability System	Blockchain provides new technologies and ideas for the construction of agricultural product traceability system (APTS). However, if data is stored, supervised, and distributed on a multiparty equal blockchain, it will face major security risks, such as data privacy leakage, unauthorized access, and trust issues. How to protect the privacy of shared data has become a key factor restricting the implementation of this technology. We propose a secure and trusted agricultural product traceability system (BCST-APTS), which is supported by blockchain and CP-ABE encryption technology. It can set access control policies through data attributes and encrypt data on the blockchain. This can not only ensure the confidentiality of the data stored in the blockchain, but also set flexible access control policies for the data. In addition, a whole-chain attribute management infrastructure has been constructed, which can provide personalized attribute encryption services. Furthermore, a reencryption scheme based on ciphertext-policy attribute encryption (RE-CP-ABE) is proposed, which can meet the needs of efficient supervision and sharing of ciphertext data. Finally, the system architecture of the BCST-APTS is designed to successfully solve the problems of mutual trust, privacy protection, fine-grained, and personalized access control between all parties.	
1424	实体经济	Joint Security and Train Control Design in Blockchain-Empowered CBTC System	The communication-based train control (CBTC) system ensures the high efficiency and orderliness of trains and is widely used in urban rail transit networks. The adoption of wireless communication and network techniques makes the CBTC systems more vulnerable to cyber attacks. Identity authentication is an effective approach to improve system security. The existing identity authentication mechanisms in CBTC adopt a centralized key management system sensitive to single-point failures. To improve system security, in this article, we deploy a blockchain in CBTC systems. The client that runs the blockchain program not only acts as blockchain nodes to provide distributed key management for the CBTC system but they also work as a relay node to authenticate the communication between train control nodes in CBTC systems. Based on the blockchain-empowered distributed security scheme, the block producer selection and onboard blockchain client handoff decision problem are studied. With the objective to minimize the impact of the key updating process on CBTC system performance and keep the system security under a reasonable level, we formulate the block producer selection and onboard blockchain client handoff decision problem using the deep reinforcement learning approach. Extensive simulation results illustrate that the proposed blockchain-empowered security scheme can significantly improve the CBTC system security, and CBTC systems need to sacrifice part performance to ensure system security.	blockchain;security;public key;internet of things;protocols;system performance;authentication;blockchain;communication-based train control (cbtc);deep reinforcement learning;securityvulnerability analysis;performance;internet;things
1425	核心技术	Blockchain based Chaotic Deep GAN Encryption scheme for securing medical images in a cloud environment	Enormous reports, like scanned medical pictures and electronic patient records, are generated by modern healthcare equipment, and these reports must be secured for future access. Conventional storage technologies are incapable of storing large amounts of data. Cloud storage systems, fortunately, satisfy because of their features, like availability and scalability. Although medical images can be saved in the cloud, majority of cloud service providers store them in plain text format. Because of hackers and the increasing computer power, current image encryption methods are vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, a Block chain based Chaotic Deep Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Encryption Scheme is proposed. The BCDGE uses blockchain technology to protect personal information and verify the authenticity of the data. Secondly, the Chaotic Deep GAN Encryption method uses confusion, substitution, and diffusion principles to encrypt the medical image. The Deep GAN creates image-specific secret keys to improve the resilience against hackers, produced keys utilized as an input for confusion and diffusion phases. The sender transfers the encrypted medical picture to the cloud server, signs the ciphertext ID, and saves it to block chain. The security and performance analysis of the proposed scheme gives better results than the existing schemes.	cloud computing;medical image;data security;encryption;block chain;cryptography
1426	核心技术	Blockchain Data Secure Transmission Method Based on Homomorphic Encryption	To ensure the security of data transmission and recording in Internet environment monitoring systems, this paper proposes a study of a secure method of blockchain data transfer based on homomorphic encryption. Blockchain data transmission is realized through homomorphic encryption. Homomorphic encryption can not only encrypt the original data, but also ensure that the data result after decrypting the data is the same as the original data. The asymmetric encrypted public key is collected by Internet of things (IoT) equipment to realize the design of blockchain data secure transmission method based on homomorphic encryption. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the first transmission is as high as 88% when using the transmission method in this paper. After several experiments, the transmission accuracy is high by using the design method in this paper. In the last test, the transmission accuracy is still 88%, and the data transmission effect is relatively stable. At the same time, compared to the management method used in this article, the transfer method used in this paper is more reliable than the original transfer method and is not prone to data distortion. It can be seen that this method has high transmission accuracy and short transmission time, which effectively avoids the data tampering caused by too long time in the transmission process.	scheme
1427	核心技术	A Metaheuristic Approach for Encrypting Blockchain Data Attributes Using Ciphertext Policy Technique	Unlike public chains, the Alliance Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric has a member management service mechanism that may provide data isolation security at the channel level. However, because this data isolation security technique synchronizes plaintext data inside the channel, data leakage is still a possibility. Furthermore, in some fine-grained privacy protection circumstances, channel-based data access restriction is ineffective. In order to solve the data privacy security problems in the above-mentioned consortium chain superledger, a blockchain data attribute encryption scheme based on ciphertext policy is proposed. Combining the original Fabric Certificate Authority module in the Hyperledger, the proposed scheme can realize the user-level fine-grained security access to control blockchain data while also realizing the secure distribution of user attribute keys in the blockchain data attribute encryption scheme based on the ciphertext policy scheme. The security analysis of the scheme shows that the scheme achieves the security goals of attribute-based encryption user attribute private key secure distribution and data privacy protection. The scope of this research is that this study confirms that the solution's architecture achieves fine-grained access control of private data on the Hyperledger Blockchain network and also the security objectives of secure transmission of user characteristic secret keys and data privacy protection. The performance analysis part also shows that the proposed scheme has good usability.	
1428	核心技术	Blockchain-Empowered High-Frequency Spectrum Management IoT: A Multilayer PBFT Consensus Perspective	High frequency (HF) is an important method for long-range communications and even the only mean when satellites are destroyed or interfered, which play an essential role in defense and economic construction. However, noncooperative frequency competition accompanied with power competition results in the continuously deterioration of HF electromagnetic environment. This article endeavors to resolve this issue through proposing blockchain-empowered HF spectrum management. Specifically, massive personal HF devices are organized around the preselected nodes to construct HF spectrum management IoT, further monitor, and share HF data through PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) protocol. To address the scalability problem during the consensus, a multilayer PBFT consensus protocol is employed. Scalability evaluations show that increasing consensus layers of PBFT greatly reduces the communication complexity. Security assessments illustrate that the security performance will decline with the increase of layers. Tradeoff has been made between the communication complexity and security performance, indicating 2-4 layers PBFT is sufficient, which bring down the communication complexity and also achieve acceptable security performance.	research issues;security;internet;5g
1429	核心技术	Consensus Mechanism of Blockchain Based on PoR with Data Deduplication	As the basis of cloud computing, distributed storage technology mainly studies how data centers store, organize and manage data. Blockchain has become the most secure solution for cloud storage due to its decentralization and immutability. Consensus mechanism is one of the core technologies of blockchain, which affects the transaction processing capability, security and scalability of blockchain. The current mainstream consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake all have the problem of wasting resources. And with the explosive growth of data, cloud storage nodes store a large amount of redundant data, which inevitably increases storage overhead and computing cost. To this end, we propose to use the Proof of Retrievability with deduplication algorithm as the consensus mechanism of the blockchain system and design a blockchain consensus protocol suitable for distributed storage. First, the data integrity verification protocol in the scheme guarantees that storage nodes correctly store the data they promise to store. Second, the deduplication algorithm in the protocol can optimize data auditing, greatly reduce the need for data storage space, and improve the scalability of data transmission. In addition, the scheme uses ring signatures in the audit process to ensure user anonymity and data unlinkability, while providing highly reliable data storage, and ensuring data storage security through blockchain. Finally, we demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme and evaluate its performance. The evaluation results show that our scheme is efficient and scalable.	integrity verification;consensus;blockchain;deduplicationdigital continuity;privacy
1430	实体经济	Blockchain Adoption for Sustainable Supply Chain Management: Economic, Environmental, and Social Perspectives	Due to the rapid increase in environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources, the focus of researchers is shifted from economic to socio-environmental problems. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has the potential to restructure the entire supply chain for sustainable practices. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that provides a digital database for recording all the transactions of the supply chain. The main purpose of this research is to explore the literature relevant to blockchain for sustainable supply chain management. The focus of this review is on the sustainability of the blockchain-based supply chain concerning environmental conservation, social equality, and governance effectiveness. Using a systematic literature review, a total of 136 articles were evaluated and categorized according to the triple bottom-line aspects of sustainability. Challenges and barriers during blockchain adoption in different industrial sectors such as aviation, shipping, agriculture and food, manufacturing, automotive, pharmaceutical, and textile industries were critically examined. This study has not only explored the economic, environmental, and social impacts of blockchain but also highlighted the emerging trends in a circular supply chain with current developments of advanced technologies along with their critical success factors. Furthermore, research areas and gaps in the existing research are discussed, and future research directions are suggested. The findings of this study show that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain from a sustainability perspective. Blockchain will not only improve the economic sustainability of the supply chain through effective traceability, enhanced visibility through information sharing, transparency in processes, and decentralization of the entire structure but also will help in achieving environmental and social sustainability through resource efficiency, accountability, smart contracts, trust development, and fraud prevention. The study will be helpful for managers and practitioners to understand the procedure of blockchain adoption and to increase the probability of its successful implementation to develop a sustainable supply chain network.	blockchain;sustainable supply chain;green supply chain;triple bottom-line;circular supply chain;traceabilityfood traceability;technology;challenges;logistics;operations;framework;design;system;trends;impact
1431	实体经济	Supply chain information coordination based on blockchain technology: A comparative study with the traditional approach	Blockchain technology has subverted traditional supply chain operational models and transformed information interactions along supply chains. This paper examines the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain information collaboration and operating costs. This paper develops a three-level supply chain model based on blockchain technology that incorporates retailer sensitivity to information. First, the manufacturer's profit function is developed, and the optimal information-sharing quantity and supply chain pricing decisions are analysed. Then, cost models for both the traditional supply chain and the novel supply chain using blockchain technology are developed and the impact of blockchain technology on supply chain operating costs is determined. The results demonstrate that blockchain technology can effectively reduce supply chain operating costs. In addition, this study has an interesting finding that if blockchain adoption is valuable for the supply chain, the quantity of information-sensitive should be moderate. Too many or too few information-sensitive retailers can reduce the value of the blockchain's use. This is because blockchain is implementation will increase the privacy concerns of supply chain companies.	blockchain-based supply chain;supply chain management;information management;operations management;information-sensitive;costsdesign;impact;power
1432	核心技术	IPFS and Blockchain Based Reliability and Availability Improvement for Integrated Rivers' Streamflow Data	The streamflow data acquisition with various techniques and dispersing of River's locations demand improvement of reliability and frequency aspects. One of the reliability measurement characteristics is data ownership. The authority sharing data authorizes its quality and is also responsible for the wrong decision triggered by incorrect data. The consensus-based crowdsourcing data contribute to aggregated streamflow records' generation. The aggregated streamflow records are stored on a streamflow ledger, a Hyperledger fabric-based ledger for rivers' streamflow data. In contrast, InterPlanery File System (IPFS) distributed file storage system is helpful for policy documents and distribution scheme storage. Blockchain-based techniques for improvement of data-intensive decision support systems. The distributed river streamflow data measured and shared by distributed gauging officials and stored on the blockchain-based distributed storage system contributes to scalability, transparency, availability, and accessibility of shareable data. All stakeholders require quality data with trust and provenance management through a persistent, linked, and immutable copy of data. This technique resolves the conflict or disagreement on streamflow optimization and flood mitigation decisions. In a nutshell, the blockchain technology with IPFS for off-chain large files storage would contribute twofold to irrigation systems and flood mitigation domains. On one side, the streamflow data aggregation has consensus from streamflow assessment for software agents and stakeholders. Secondly, the persistent data copy is shared among distributed stakeholders using IPFS-based content addressed file-sharing protocol for a common operating picture to improve effective collaboration and coordination among managers of irrigation systems and flood mitigation activities.	stakeholders;monitoring;rivers;blockchains;irrigation;wireless sensor networks;floods;ipfs;blockchain;irrigation system;internet of things;trust;reliability;consensuswireless sensor networks;discharge;flow;altimetry;system
1433	实体经济	Evolutionary game study on the governance and development of online car-hailing based on blockchain technology	Changes in the online car-hailing industry have brought new challenges to government governance. Effectively enhancing governance efficiency has become the focus of academic research. Based on the technical governance perspective, this paper introduces the consortium blockchain to construct an evolutionary game model between the online car-hailing platform and the government under blockchain technology. By solving the replicated dynamic equations and the Jacobian matrix, the influences of the change in initial conditions and decision parameters on the evolutionary stability results are revealed, and numerical experiments are carried out by using the Python programming language. This paper claims that the system presents three evolutionary stable results and a periodic stochastic state when the key parameters are located in different thresholds. The additional cost of the platform's negative regulation and the government's punishment intensity have a positive effect on the evolution of the system to the ideal state (active regulation, active governance). Platform technology R&D cost and government innovation input have a negative effect on the evolution of the system to the ideal state. Therefore, using blockchain to increase the additional cost of the platform's negative regulation, appropriately increasing the government's punishment intensity, reasonably controlling the government's innovation input to the platform, and reducing the technology R&D cost of the platform will help the system evolve into an ideal state. This paper provides useful references to implement effective governance and the innovative and healthy development of the online car-hailing industry.	
1434	实体经济	An Exploratory Study on the Design and Management Model of Traditional Chinese Medicine Quality Safety Traceability System Based on Blockchain Technology	Aiming at the problems of long life cycle complex roles of participants, diverse risk factors, poor supervision coverage and difficult information traceability of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) supply chain, this paper constructs a TCM quality safety traceability system based on blockchain technology by analyzing the business process and supervision characteristics of TCM supply chain. Blockchain technology is a new application mode of computer technology such as distributed data storage, peer-to-peer transmission, consensus mechanism, encryption algorithm, and other computer technologies. It has the characteristics of "decentralization, nontampering, transparent and open, and data traceability." The function of nontampering, hash function, and time stamp can effectively solve the traceability problem of TCM supply chain. Through the analysis of the blockchain TCM traceability principle and network structure, combined with the actual business process of TCM traceability, this paper designs the blockchain TCM quality safety traceability system, analyzes its overall structure, data storage mode, digital signature, consensus algorithm, and main functions, and preliminarily constructs a new model of TCM quality safety traceability management based on blockchain technology. Using blockchain technology to realize the quality safety traceability of TCM, we can complete the omnidirectional, multiangle, and wide coverage of the data and information in whole supply chain of TCM breeding and seedling raising, planting, innovation and research and development, processing of TCM pieces, circulation of TCM, and consumption, so as to realize that the main body of responsibility of TCM can be put on record, the production records can be queried, product flow can be traced, quality safety can be forewarned, main responsibility can be identified, regulatory information can be shared, and product source can be traced.	internet
1435	实体经济	Novel Multi Security and Privacy Benchmarking Framework for Blockchain-Based IoT Healthcare Industry 4.0 Systems	The evaluation, importance and variation nature of multiple security and privacy properties are the main issues that make the benchmarking of blockchain-based IoT healthcare Industry 4.0 systems fall under the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. In this article, one of the recent MCDM weighting methods called fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency (FWZIC) is effective for weighting the evaluation criteria subjectively without any inconsistency issues. However, considering the advantages of spherical fuzzy sets in providing a wide range of options to decision-makers and efficiently dealing with vagueness, hesitancy and uncertainty, this article formulated a new version of FWZIC for weighting the security and privacy properties, that is, spherical FWZIC (S-FWZIC). Moreover, an integrated MCDM framework was developed for benchmarking blockchain-based IoT healthcare Industry 4.0 systems on the basis of multi security and privacy properties. In the first phase of the methodology, a decision matrix is formulated based on the intersection of "blockchain-based Internet of Things healthcare Industry 4.0 systems" and "security and privacy properties" (i.e., user authentication, access control, privacy protection, integrity availability and anonymity). In the second phase, the weights of each security and privacy property are calculated through the S-FWZIC method. Then, these weights are employed to benchmark blockchain-based IoT healthcare Industry 4.0 systems through the combined grey relational analysis-technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (GRA-TOPSIS) and the bald eagle search (BES) optimization method. Results indicate the following: First, the S-FWZIC method efficiently weighs the security and privacy properties, indicating that access control has the highest significance weight of 0.2070, while integrity has the lowest weight (0.0646); and second, the combination of the GRA-TOPSIS and the BES optimization method effectively ranks the systems. The evaluation was conducted using sensitivity analysis, revealing high correlation results over all the discussed scenarios of changing the weights of the criteria. The implications of this article can assist medical organisation administrators in selecting the most secure and appropriate system and the developers of such systems in future directions.	medical services;fourth industrial revolution;privacy;benchmark testing;uncertainty;access control;optimization methods;blockchain;healthcare industry 4;0 systems;security and privacy
1436	协同技术	An Efficient Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Mechanism for Industry 4.0 Based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography	The present trend of automation anddata interchange in industrial technology is known as Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is altering its next generation of distribution networks by making them more responsive and efficient. There are various issues when implementing Internet of Thing (IoT) devices in an Industry 4.0 scenario, mainly due to reduced IoT nodes or devices with insufficient infrastructure to operate security solutions. As a result, securing the environment will require a lightweight and effective security solution. The authors of this study offer a lightweight and flexible authentication method as part of an access control strategy for secure data exchange in-vehicle networks. Lightweight operations, hash functions, XOR operations, and concatenation are all used in the proposed protocol. The security of this approach is also evaluated using AVISPA. The authentication process between IoT networks and resilience to various security threats will be demonstrated. The experimental analysis shows that the computational cost attained is 7.96 s, and the communication cost attained is 834 bits. Similarly, the resource utilization for this computation is 11%, and the average verification time is 7 ms. The experimental analysis demonstrates that the proposed method is efficient with lower computational cost, communication costs, verification cost, and resource utilization than the existing state-of-the-art approaches	fourth industrial revolution;authentication;security;elliptic curves;elliptic curve cryptography;blockchains;cryptography;elliptic curve cryptography (ecc);industry 4;0;internet of things (iots);mutual authenticationauthentication protocol;blockchain;architecture;security;system
1437	技术治理	Blockchain mining in pools: Analyzing the trade-off between profitability and ruin	The resource-consuming mining of blocks on a blockchain equipped with a Proof-of-Work consensus protocol bears the risk of ruin, namely when the operational costs for the mining exceed the received rewards. In this paper we investigate to what extent it is of interest to join a mining pool that reduces the variance of the return of a miner for a specified cost for participation. Using methodology from ruin theory and risk sharing in insurance, we quantitatively study the effects of pooling in this context and derive several explicit formulas for quantities of interest.

1438	核心技术	MB-MaaS: Mobile Blockchain-based Mining-as-a-Service for IIoT environments	In this paper, we propose a mobile blockchain (MB) based mining-as-a-service (MaaS) scheme, MBMaaS for resource-constrained industrial internet-of-things (IIoT) environments. The scheme addresses the research gaps of fixed static allocation for miners to perform computationally intensive mining tasks through a multi-hop computational offloading (CO) scheme and addresses an auction mechanism for a fair bidding process among the miner nodes. The scheme operates in three phases. In the first phase, a multi-hop CO scheme with a fair incentive policy is formulated for miners. The CO schemes offer guaranteed offloading services to mobile devices from far-edge systems through a chain of neighbor nodes. Then, in the second phase, MaaS is proposed to leverage expensive mining tasks through 5Genabled pico/femtocells. Integration of 5G allows massive end-to-end device and service connectivity. As IIoT ecosystems have limited memory and compute requirements, MaaS assures that the proposed consensus has a responsive validation and mining time. To make the data exchange in the consensus process lightweight, and allow a large number of sensors to share the data in a lightweight manner, an effective consensus mechanism Lightweight Proof-of-Proximity (LPoP), is proposed that forms group validations instead of single block validation. The data is exchanged through javascript object notation (JSON) format, maintaining a steady transaction rate. MB-MaaS is compared against the existing scheme for parameters bid thresholds and request servicing times, and mining and consensus formation. For example, the request serving time at 12 requests is improved by 56.78%, and a significant improvement of 26.47% is observed for processed blocks; parsing time on average is improved by 7.89%. The comparative analysis suggests that the scheme is more efficient than other competing approaches. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

1439	平台项目	Trading volume and liquidity provision in cryptocurrency markets *	We provide empirical evidence within the context of cryptocurrency markets that the returns from liquidity provision, proxied by the returns of a short-term reversal strategy, are primarily concentrated in trading pairs with lower levels of market activity. Empirically, we focus on a moderately large cross section of cryptocurrency pairs traded against the U.S. Dollar from March 1, 2017 to March 1, 2022 on multiple centralised exchanges. Our findings suggest that expected returns from liquidity provision are amplified in smaller, more volatile, and less liquid cryptocurrency pairs where fear of adverse selection might be higher. A panel regression analysis confirms that the interaction between lagged returns and trading volume contains significant predictive information for the dynamics of cryptocurrency returns. This is consistent with theories that highlight the role of inventory risk and adverse selection for liquidity provision.	liquidity provision;short-term reversal;trading volume;empirical asset pricing;adverse selectionbid-ask spreads;return;equilibrium;model;risk
1440	实体经济	An analysis on the role of blockchain-based platforms in agricultural supply chains br	The traditional agricultural supply chain (ASC) has been overwhelmed by several challenges, including financing risk, counterparty risk, and lack of consumer trust. Platforms based on blockchain technology combined with Internet-of-Things technology have emerged to address these challenges by improving supply chain visibility, guaranteeing the execution of contracts, and increasing the authenticity of products' provenance information in the ASC. This study an-alyzes how the adoption of a blockchain-based platform can affect the decisions of ASC partici-pants and identifies how the platform creates value for the supply chain by addressing these three challenges. We consider a two-level supply chain featuring a typical cooperative and a buyer and establish stylized game models with and without the blockchain-based platform. By comparing equilibrium outcomes with and without the blockchain-based platform, we show that the involvement of the blockchain-based platform can lead to increased production quantity and total surplus of the supply chain. This can also motivate more sustainability/green investment to produce greener products. Interestingly, we show that the value of the blockchain-based platform decreases in the credibility of the business environment in which the supply chain operates. Furthermore, the buyer will always benefit from the established blockchain-based platform, whereas the cooperative can benefit in most cases but could be worse off under certain conditions. The adoption and operational costs could outweigh the benefits caused by the addition of the blockchain-based platform	blockchain-based platforms;agricultural supply chain;financing risk;counterparty risk;consumer trusttechnology;challenges;certification;consumption;environment;management;framework
1441	实体经济	Challenges and opportunities of blockchain energy applications: Interrelatedness among technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions	The energy sector is undergoing a transition of decarbonization, decentralization, and digitalization. This paper explores the application of blockchain in this transition. Through qualitative content analysis, expert interviews and discussion rooted in recent literature, key insights on the practical challenges and opportunities of blockchain energy applications are investigated. This is done in technological, economic, social, environmental, and institutional dimensions in order to propose holistic insights. Key dentified issues include scalability, data privacy, costs of change, market dynamics, user experience, skills, multi-stakeholder governance, and regulatory change. Key identified opportunities also range across these dimensions, such as blockchain advancements, power market development, user research, and regulatory sandboxes. While most research on blockchain energy applications has been from the technological lens, this paper contributes with a multi-dimensional approach. The interrelatedness among these dimensions is one of the key messages of this paper. Both corporate strategy and public policy development need to integrate user behavior research, business model innovation and regulatory experimentation for a holistic approach in understanding and implementing blockchain, and other emerging technologies. It is suggested that the multi-dimensional challenges and opportunities identified in this study, and functioning of their interrelatedness, are of interest for further exploration both in academia and among practitioners.	blockchain;peer-to-peer;digitalization;distributed energy resourcespeer-to-peer;systems;future
1442	实体经济	A Secure Cloudlet-Based Charging Station Recommendation for Electric Vehicles Empowered by Federated Learning	The fast-growing electric vehicles (EVs) industry requires a well-designed recommendation system to locate charging stations while ensuring private data protection. This article proposes a secure cloudlet-based recommendation system for EVs. Unlike conventional methods where training a recommender model involves direct data sharing between data holders, our model utilizes a secure vertical federated learning technique, in which EVs data do not leave the platforms. To improve the efficiency of the model and to alleviate the communication-related concerns in our recommender model, cloudlet-based data aggregator(s) are used as a replacement for the existing centralized architectures. To enhance the security of our system, blockchain technology is incorporated to generate a trusted network of cloudlets that are responsible for transmitting the locally computed training parameters. The simulation results achieved from our proposed recommendation system show that the distribution of EVs over a designated area with charging stations is more optimal, and the proposed decentralized recommender with 10 cloudlets is 5.2 s quicker than a conventional centralized model.	blockchains;cloud computing;data models;collaborative work;charging stations;training;real-time systems;blockchain;charging station recommendation;cloudlet;electric vehicles (evs);vertical federated learning (vfl)blockchain

This study develops a new theoretical model based on technology, organisation and environment (TOE), and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theories to fill the literature gaps. The underpinning theories are utilised to capture the motivation of manufacturing industry firms to adopt blockchain technology while supporting carbon trading activities. Using survey data, we examine the perception of early adopters of blockchain technology and their relationships to energy efficiency. The results show that attributes such as the contract system, firm size, and compatibility significantly affect energy efficiency. Paradoxically, top management support, competitive pressure, regulatory support, relative advantage, and complexity were not, as prior literature suggests, crucial drivers. Adopting blockchain technology can help a firm improve business transparency, manage energy consumption, and provide a strong business case for firms in this study.	blockchain technology adoption;carbon trading;energy efficiency;diffusion of innovation;technology;organisation and environment theorymanagement-practices;information-technology;innovation adoption;user acceptance;unified theory;services;implementation;determinants;leadership;diffusion
1444	实体经济	On-Demand Ride-Hailing Service Platforms With Hired Drivers During Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak: Can Blockchain Help?	During the recent COVID-19 (CoV) global outbreak, there is a sharp decline of revenue of on-demand ride-hailing (ODR) platforms because people have serious worries of infection in the shared vehicles. Blockchain, which supports cryptocurrency and creates full traceability of the service history of each car and driver, may come to rescue by allowing the platform to offer only the "safe cars" to consumers. Motivated by the real world challenges associated with the CoV outbreak for the ODR platform, we build game-theoretical models based on the M/M/n queuing system to explore if and how blockchain can help. In the basic model, the ODR platform decides the service price and special hygiene level. Comparing between the cases with and without blockchain, we find that blockchain implementation increases both the service price and hygiene level. In addition, when the consumers' inherent worry of infection is substantially large, implementing blockchain achieves all-win for the ODR platform, drivers and consumers. In the extended models, we first consider the case when the special hygiene level is determined by the drivers under a mixed-leadership game and then explore the case when customers are risk averse. The main findings about blockchain adoption remain valid in both cases. However, when the drivers take charge of the special hygiene level, both optimal decisions are lower in most cases. It is also important to make efforts to reduce consumers' feeling volatility toward service valuation for improving the value of blockchain adoption and related performances.	blockchains;vehicles;covid-19;pricing;biological system modeling;dvd;analytical models;blockchain;coronavirus outbreak;pricing;ride-hailing platform operationsmanagement;technology;logistics;model
1445	实体经济	Risk assessment of maritime container shipping blockchain-integrated systems: An analysis of multi-event scenarios br	Blockchain applications in maritime logistics services face uncertainties and risks, obstructing a broader and more sustainable adoption. Although the operational risk of blockchain-integrated systems (BISs) is significant, studies in this area are still conceptual and scarce. This research is a mixed-methods risk analysis focusing on (1) modeling the risk situation by a connected network of potential disruptive events in container shipping BISs, and (2) applying a quantitative risk analysis with probabilistic indexes considering the multiplicity of multi-event risk scenarios (MESs). Thirty-two telephone interviews with experts from container terminal operators, shipping companies, and freight forwarders helped establish a risk network with the description of 25 vertices and 54 directed connections. The quantitative analysis of 64 web survey responses provided insights and foresight about different characteristics of each risk and causal connection. The results enable a comprehensive view of the potential failure modes of blockchain applica-tions. This study is the first to explore the potential risk situation in container shipping BISs with inputs from the industry. The applied methodological framework expands the toolkit of risk re-searchers, analysts, and managers against the fast-paced development of digitalization in mari-time logistics and supply chain operations	blockchain application;risk analysis;container shipping;blockchain-integrated system;network analysis;digitalizationlogistics;technology;future;transportation;management
1446	核心技术	A multi-dimension traceable privacy-preserving prevention and control scheme of the COVID-19 epidemic based on blockchain	The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought great pain to people around the world. As an epidemic prevention and control measure, the health QR code (HC) has been designed to trace the confirmed cases and close contacts quickly. Although some existing health code schemes preserve the privacy, but most of them are either unsupported for fine-grained auditability or centralised health code storage. Therefore, we propose a multi-dimension traceable privacy-preserving HC scheme based on blockchain. It prevents health code information being tampered with and supports the traceability of virus transmission chain. We utilise attribute-based encryption to protect residents' privacy information and achieve fine-grained access control. Furthermore, to support the multi-dimension traceability by the epidemic prevention and control departments, the searchable encryption has been introduced. Finally, we give the security analysis and performance evaluation to verify the feasibility and practical significance of our scheme.	health qr code;hyperledger fabric;cp-abe;searchable encryptionpublic-key encryption;framework
1447	核心技术	A blockchain-based transaction system with payment statistics and supervision	Due to existing blockchain systems concentrate mainly on privacy protection but lack payment statistics and supervision, we propose a blockchain-based transaction system with payment statistics and supervision. In the system, a payer uses a homomorphic encryption scheme to protect payment amounts. After the transaction is recorded in the blockchain, not only the payee can decrypt the payment amounts and use for future payment, but also the payer can even decrypt it and use for payment statistics. Besides, two supervisors can independently decrypt all users' payment amounts to master the whole economic dynamism and detect illegal transactions. Comparing with existing schemes, our homomorphic scheme only increases a little length of ciphertext, but supports payment amounts decryption by the payer, an additional two receivers. Finally, analyses show that our system is extremely efficient.	blockchain;homomorphic encryption;privacy protection;payment statistics;supervisionshort signatures
1448	核心技术	A Hybrid Blockchain-Based Log Management Scheme With Nonrepudiation for Smart Grids	In the era of Industry 4.0 and digital transformation, smart grid (SG) plays an important role in the construction of various smart places. Logs produced by electrical appliances recording power consumption within the grid contain private information and may be collected as evidence for the services of dispute resolution or digital forensics. Therefore, security of the logs is of paramount importance. Our work designs a blockchain-enabled log management scheme with nonrepudiation for SGs. In this article, we employ ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to establish a fine-grained access control of the logs, which addresses data confidentiality concern. In addition, we introduce a hybrid blockchain system generating novel signature chains, for achieving an efficient private log protection system with a lot of properties including data loss prevention, tamper resistance, immutability and nonrepudiation. Employing various cost-saving solutions, our scheme achieves an efficient communication with more functionalities and security features, compared with the predecessor works.	blockchains;access control;informatics;digital signatures;servers;encryption;computational modeling;blockchain;ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (cp-abe);digital signature;nonrepudiation;power usage;signature chain;signcryption-based access controlsecurity
1449	核心技术	Blockchain-enabled multi-authorization and multi-cloud attribute-based keyword search over encrypted data in the cloud	With the arrival of the 5G era, fast and secure data sharing is attracting increased attention. Among of the presented solutions, keyword search plays an important role since it can identify users and search ciphertext without decryption. However, the existing searchable algorithms have many limitations, such as powerful central authority, match processes being only carried out on the cloud server, and center corruption and single point of failure being easy to cause. Presently, the fairness of the keyword search is still a challenge. To solve these problems, we present a multi-authority and multi-cloud keyword search scheme based on the consortium blockchain and attribute-based encryption. Under this framework, multi-cloud block storage technique is used to address the unreliability of cloud servers, where at least two ciphertext files are stored in blocks on multiple cloud servers. It can resist malicious leaks, ciphertext tampering, and deletion of ciphertext by cloud servers. Blockchain allows the proposed scheme to achieve the integrity and correctness of the encrypted data, which also solves the fairness of search results. Furthermore, the scheme realizes privacy protection by hiding the keyword and the access policy in the trapdoor matching process. Finally, the security analyses and performance comparisons show the advantages of the proposed scheme over the existing work.	searchable encryption;multi-authority;multi-cloud;privacy protection;consortium blockchainaccess-control scheme;authority;efficient
1450	核心技术	Proof by Earnestness (PoE) to determine the authenticity of subjective information in blockchains-application in supply chain risk management	Blockchain is being used in various global supply chains with its ever-increasing maturity and popularity. However, in the presence of subjective information that does not have a digital footprint, blockchain application is a grey area. This is due to the difficulty in confirming the authenticity or legitimacy of information before achieving consensus on it using existing mechanisms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Stake (PoS). In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we propose the Proof by Earnestness (PoE) consensus mechanism that determines the subjective information's truthfulness before further processing and formalising in blockchains. We consider supply chain risk management (SCRM) as our application area due to the vast amount of available subjective information. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

1451	实体经济	RETAILER'S WILLINGNESS TO ADOPT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY BASED ON PRIVATE DEMAND INFORMATION	This paper considers a supply chain that includes one supplier and one retailer, in which the retailer has a more accurate demand forecast. The blockchain technology can verify the authenticity of the information, then the retailer can choose to truly share the demand information with the supplier by adopting such a costly technology. We discuss three scenarios based on signaling game: the retailer bears all the cost (no subsidy), the supplier bears part of the cost by providing direct subsidy or wholesale discount, respectively. Specifically, in a demand information asymmetric setting, we mainly focus on exploring the conditions of retailer adopting blockchain technology and the supplier's subsidy strategy choice, and further verify the robustness of the model by considering the retailer's risk aversion or multiple suppliers. In all scenarios, we find that the retailer will apply threshold strategy to adopt blockchain technology. The retailer's willingness to adopt blockchain technology is negatively correlated with the corresponding adoption cost, the supplier's profit level, and positively correlated with the number of suppliers. Additionally, we find the supplier can profit from providing subsidies when the cost of adopting blockchain technology is around a medium level, and the direct subsidy is superior to wholesale discount. More surprisingly, we find subsidies may work to the disadvantage of the subsidized party. Specifically, compared to no subsidy, we find the direct subsidy and the wholesale discount can increase the retailer's willingness to adopt blockchain technology, but hurt the retailer's as well as the supply chain's profits.	supply chain management;blockchain;demand signaling;information asymmetrysupply chain;contract design;benefits;encroachment;coordination;decisions
1452	实体经济	Leveraging the circular economy with a closed-loop supply chain and a reverse omnichannel using blockchain technology and incentives	Purpose This paper aims to analyze the benefits of the blockchain to the circular economy (CE), which is composed of both closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) systems and reverse omnichannel solutions. By ensuring transparency, traceability, visibility and security, the blockchain allows firms to acquire operational capabilities through a CLSC and service capabilities through a reverse omnichannel, which can boost business performance considerably. The related network of relationships can be reinforced by establishing incentives, which entail both smart contracts in the blockchain and active return approaches in CE. Design/methodology/approach After identifying the boundaries of the theoretical framework, several research hypotheses are developed according to the literature review and emerging gaps. These gaps link to the impact of the blockchain on CE systems (CLSC and reverse omnichannel), as well as the influence on business performance. The hypotheses are then tested using structural equation modeling and adopting a partial least squares-path modeling technique on a dataset composed of 157 firms. Finally, multigroup analysis is used to test the impact of incentives on the research hypotheses. Findings The blockchain facilitates a more efficient CE system, although reverse omnichannel solutions seldom bring any benefits to performance. The shift from a passive to an active return approach must be carefully evaluated. The CLSC network can benefit from an active return approach by developing appealing incentives for collectors and enhancing the positive effects of the blockchain. In contrast, consumer incentives can have detrimental effects on the blockchain. Various combinations of incentives can only bring a few business performance increases, while collector incentives are vital to reinforce the CE system's operational and service capabilities. Originality/value This paper takes a new approach toward the study of CE, which considers a dual circular system composed of a CLSC and a reverse omnichannel. The research explores whether the adoption of blockchain technology enables better return processes by improving the operations in CLSC and services in reverse omnichannel. Finally, this is the first empirical work to evaluate the benefits emerging from incentives, which can activate smart contracts in the blockchain and enable active return approaches in CE.	circular economy;blockchain;closed-loop supply chain;reverse omnichannel;incentive mechanismsmanagement;consumption;logistics;implementation;antecedents;transport;returns;models
1453	实体经济	P2TIF: A Blockchain and Deep Learning Framework for Privacy-Preserved Threat Intelligence in Industrial IoT	The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is a fast-growing network of Internet-connected sensing and actuating devices aimed to enhance manufacturing and industrial operations. This interconnection generates a high volume of data over the IIoT network and raises serious security (e.g., the rapid evolution of hacking techniques), privacy (e.g., adversaries performing data poisoning and inference attacks), and scalability issues. To mitigate the aforementioned challenges, this article presents, a new privacy-preserved threat intelligence framework (P2TIF) to protect confidential information and to identify cyber-threats in IIoT environments. There are two major elements in the proposed P2TIF framework. First, a scalable blockchain module that enables secure communication of IIoT data and prevents data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep learning module that transforms actual data into a new format and protects data from inference attacks using a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) technique. The encoded data are then employed by a threat detection system using attention-based deep gated recurrent neural network (A-DGRNN) to recognize malicious patterns in IIoT environments. The proposed framework is validated using two different network data sources, i.e., ToN-IoT and IoT-Botnet. Security analysis and experimental results revealed the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed P2TIF framework.	industrial internet of things;blockchains;security;deep learning;scalability;computational modeling;transforms;blockchain;deep learning (dl);industrial internet of things (iiot);privacy-preservation;threat intelligence (ti)ton-iot;security;challenges
1454	平台项目	A blockchain-based integrated and interconnected hybrid platform for Smart City ecosystem	There has been an increasing demand for shaping the world's cities into smart cities by adopting modern technological solutions. In recent times, Blockchain has emerged as a most promising technology with a wide range of applications, and its adoption to several smart city solutions is also observed. However, these existing blockchain-based smart city solutions are restricted to individual sectors only, and there is a lack of connectivity and composability among them. This makes them incapable of providing hassle-free services which involve multiple sectors. In fact, a fully-fledged smart city solution demands the integration of different solutions pertaining to different sectors, leading to a seamless interaction among its stakeholders across the boundary. To this aim, in this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain-based platform to foster a complete smart city solution with the integration of different crucial sectors involved in the functioning of the smart city. We design an architecture for multiple blockchain networks to connect and share information among themselves through intra- and inter-blockchain communication, enabling citizens to avail inter-blockchain services as well. We also address the security and privacy aspects of intra- and inter-network transactions. We present our working prototype using Hyperledger Fabric and Node.JS. The empirical evidence acquired from system benchmarks and load testings is encouraging, with an enhanced throughput for intra-blockchain transactions on Hyperledger Fabric, compared to the Ethereum blockchain platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of its kind, addressing the integration of different smart city sectors through interconnected blockchain networks.	smart city;inter-blockchain communication;access control;information security;hyperledger fabriccities;systems;service;model
1455	平台项目	A Hesitant Fermatean Fuzzy CoCoSo Method for Group Decision-Making and an Application to Blockchain Platform Evaluation	The existing score functions of Fermatean fuzzy number (FFN) show some defects. In addition, the evaluation information given by decision-makers in real decision-making processes may be several discrete values rather than single value, which cannot be represented by the classical Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS). The combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) method can get a compromise solution by incorporating multi-aggregation strategy; however, the final aggregation operator adopted in the CoCoSo method may cause irrational results. To bridge the above gaps, in this study, we first determine a new score function of FFNs. Then, we define the hesitant Fermatean fuzzy sets based on hesitant fuzzy sets and FFSs to process uncertain information flexibly. Next, we develop an ensemble ranking approach to overcome the limitation of the original CoCoSo method regarding aggregation bias. Afterwards, we propose a hesitant Fermatean fuzzy CoCoSo method for multiple criteria group decision-making. Last, we verify its effectiveness and practicability through a case study on the selection of blockchain platform. At the same time, we perform sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the method, and emphasize its advantages through comparative analysis.	multiple criteria group decision-making;hesitant fermatean fuzzy sets;hesitant fuzzy sets;fermatean fuzzy sets;cocosocriteria;model
1456	实体经济	A Blockchain and AI Based Vaccination Tracking Framework for Coronavirus (COVID-19) Epidemics	The Coronavirus disease, i.e. (COVID-19) pandemic outbreaks has inevitably lead to a corresponding movement restrictive measure by the members of both central and state government leadership. The current limitation of healthcare systems cannot predict the COVID-19 outbreaks and vaccination drive. The need of the hour is to use Blockchain Technology for the construction of immutable ledger. In this paper a Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled COVID-19 vaccine tracking system has been proposed. The proposed system is designed using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), decentralized storage by Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) and implemented using Truffle and Ganache Tool. The smart contract interaction among the entities is developed with Drizzle and the front-end using ReactJS . The performance of the proposed framework has been presented with Keccack 256 transaction hash, the total number of transactions, gas consumed by each contract. Additionally the performance parameters such as latency, throughput, traffic in, out, CPU, and memory utilization of the blockchain framework are also calculated. The artificial neural network (ANN) has been used to classify the vaccination group. Such an attempt is a worthwhile addition to the state of the art as evident from the results presented herein. The proposed framework provides a way for vaccinated members of the community to be tracked and indexed so as to avail the benefits, for example, less restrictive movements nationally, internationally, or simply in their own respective communities. This paper leverages the advantages of Blockchain Technology to obtain a reliable and accurate way to facilitate the entire tracking process.	blockchain;covid-19;ganache;keccack-256;tracing;truffle;vaccination
1457	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Cross-Domain Authentication for Intelligent 5G-Enabled Internet of Drones	While 5G can facilitate high-speed Internet access and make over-the-horizon control a reality for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs; also known as drones), there are also potential security and privacy considerations, for example, authentication among drones. Centralized authentication approaches not only suffer from a single point of failure but they are also incapable of cross-domain authentication. This complicates the cooperation of drones from different domains. To address these limitations, a blockchain-based cross-domain authentication scheme for intelligent 5G-enabled Internet of drones is proposed in this article. Our approach employs multiple signatures based on threshold sharing to build an identity federation for collaborative domains. This allows us to support domain joining and exiting. Reliable communication between cross-domain devices is achieved by utilizing smart contract for authentication. The session keys are negotiated to secure subsequent communication between two parties. Our security and performance evaluations show that the proposed scheme is resistant to common attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices (including drones), as well as demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.	blockchains;authentication;drones;security;smart contracts;peer-to-peer computing;5g mobile communication;5g-enabled drone;artificial intelligence (ai);blockchain;cross-domain authentication;distributed collaboration;smart contractsecurity;attacks

Selfish mining is a kind of mining strategy where selfish minersincrease their profit by selectively publishing hidden blocks. This paper buildsthe selfish mining model from the perspective of node state conversion and utilizethe function extremum method tofigure out the optimal profit of this model.Meanwhile, based on the experimental data of honest mining, the author conductsthe simulation of selfish mining and discovers that selfish miners are able toacquire more revenue than honest miners when they account for more than1/3 computing power of the whole system.

1459	核心技术	Exploration of Mined Block Temporarily Holding and Enforce Fork Attacks by Selfish Mining Pool in Proof-of-Work Blockchain Systems	We explored mined block temporarily holding (MBTH), MBTH with enforce fork (MBTH-EF), and intermittent MBTH-EF (iMBTH-EF) attacks to understand the effect of selfish mining on winning rate and fairness from the pool operation perspective. The temporary holding time of the current mined block provides a pool additional time to begin mining the next block early with MBTH attack. In this situation, the winning probability increases for the next block, but the pool may risk losing the mined block. One enhanced method to maintain the winning probability of the held block is to ensure the holding pool sends out the mined block once it receives the mined block message from the other pools with the MBTH-EF attack. The explored MBTH attacks differ from the existing selfish miner and pool attacks. The operations and effects of the MBTH-EF attack are different from stubborn mining strategies and a self-holding attack integrates selfish and stubborn mining attacks. We propose a mining competition solution that does not involve actual hash calculation. It entails using one stochastic target hash value for batch racing simulation to evaluate the holding threshold, holding periods, mining time, mining difficulty, pool sizes, and the rate of fork occurrences according to the operation data of the Bitcoin system. Accordingly, the dynamic time-by-time, block-by-block, and pool-by-pool simulations are adopted to study these attacks. We analyzed MBTH and MBTH-EF attacks as well as evaluated the effects of the win rate on when and how long a block is held. Because the periodic adjustment of mining difficulty reduces the holding effect, we further evaluated how an intermittent MBTH-EF (iMBTH-EF) attack model balance the average mining time and mining difficulty according to the mining difficulty adjustment of a stage. The effect of intermittent holding is examined on the mining game win rate for a long-term competition. We also identified suitable attack detection methods for the future work according to the simulation results.	data mining;blockchains;games;bitcoin;simulation;licenses;delays;attack model;blockchain;consensus;fork;selfish mining;simulation;temporarily holdingimpact;network
1460	市场治理	Digital currencies and great power rivalry: China as a disseminator in the digital age	The United States reign as global hegemon has been empowered by massive structural power over key international economic, technological and ideological networks. As chief disseminator during the era of emerging computer technology and communications, the U.S. became a rules-maker, empowered to shape international governance in its favour. However, a new era of digitalized assets, transactions and networks will provide an opportunity for Central Bank Digital Currencies ('CBDCs') to constitute the technological-financial-business bones of the developing digitalized global economy. CBDCs will exert massive influence on the international economic, technological and ideological orders. Moreover, all of these impacts are inextricably connected to the hegemonic rivalry between the United States and China. Astutely, China has been developing the digital Yuan and is the first major economy to distribute a CBDC. If China's CBDC successfully migrates to external usage, and depending upon the degree of crucial Chinese domestic reforms, the digital Yuan may offer an opportunity for China to be a disseminator in the digital age. Chinese influence over global networks and governance frameworks would vest China with advantageous structural power in the economic, technological and ideological spheres - the fulcrums of the U.S.-China hegemonic rivalry.	cbdcs;data-driven digitalization;hegemonic rivalry;structural power;governance models

China CBDC has been in research and development since 2014. The process speeded up in 2019. It is currently at the stage of expanding real field experiments. Residents in 11 areas can open e-wallets linked to nine major banks. It is centralized digital cash designed to gradually replace traditional paper cash and coins (M0). It will be supported by the traditional double-layer banking system. It is not blockchain based at issuance but is technology neutral in distribution. Internet and technology companies may join commercial banks in distributing the China CBDC. In the short run, the China CBDC will help improve domestic financial monitoring and policy implementation. In the long run, it may play a role in the RMB's internationalization or even the international monetary system's evolution.	cbdc;digital currency;financial regulation;international monetary system;rmb internationalization;e40;e42

Using Hofstede's cultural framework (i.e. Power Distance, Individualism, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance and Long-term Orientation) to measure different cultural values, we find that countries with more power distance, masculinity and long-term orientation cultures are more eager to adopt a CBDC. By contrast, countries with a cultural value leaning towards uncertainty avoidance are less involved in the adoption of a CBDC. These results hold more for retail CBDC than for wholesale CBDC.	national culture;central bank digital currency;wholesale cbdc;retail cbdcnational culture
1464	市场治理	The Concept of Wealth (mal) in the Shari ah and Its Relation to Digital Assets	The study aims to address the concept of wealth from the perspective of the Shari'ah and its relationship to contemporary digital assets such as cryptocurrency (Bitcoin). The qualitative research approach is adopted for this research. The data is collected from several resources such as books, journal articles, reports, conferences papers, and websites. The data is analyzed through an explanatory research approach by providing scholars' opinions and their arguments on the subject matter. The findings of this study show that Shari'ah provides certain conditions to consider something as asset or currency from the Shari'ah perspective. In regard to cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), the Shari'ah rules vary based on the types of cryptocurrencies and whether cryptocurrency meets the conditions to be considered as currency or assets. Moreover, either cryptocurrency is an asset or currency, it should not contravene any Shari'ah laws, such as ribs (interest) and gharar (uncertainty). Since Shari'ah does not limit the currency to dirhams and dinars, Bitcoin can be considered as an alternative to the current currencies in a digital form. This would enable financial markets to move faster and secure transaction methods in the future. The policymakers might find this study beneficial to issue new guidelines and policy documents. The findings of the study might be interesting for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to have a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency from the Shari'ah viewpoint.	wealth;digital assets;shari'ah;cryptocurrencies;bitcoinblockchain technology;bitcoin;cryptocurrency;challenges;exchange;money

1466	市场治理	A New Hybrid Cryptocurrency Returns Forecasting Method Based on Multiscale Decomposition and an Optimized Extreme Learning Machine Using the Sparrow Search Algorithm	The return series of cryptocurrencies, which are emerging digital assets, exhibit nonstationarity, nonlinearity, and volatility clustering compared to other traditional financial markets, making them exceptionally difficult to forecast. Therefore, accurate cryptocurrency price forecasting is essential for market participants and regulators. It has been demonstrated that improved data forecasting accuracy can be achieved through decomposition, but few researchers have performed information extraction on the residual series generated by data decomposition. Based on the construction of a "decomposition-optimization-integration" hybrid model framework, in this paper, we propose a multi-scale hybrid forecasting model that combines the residual components after primary decomposition for secondary decomposition and integration. This model uses the variational modal decomposition (VMD) method to decompose the original return series into a finite number of components and residual terms. Then, the residual terms are decomposed, and the features are extracted using the completed ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method. The components are predicted by an extreme learning machine optimized by the sparrow search algorithm, and the final predictions are summed to obtain the final results. Forecasts for the returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are significant cryptocurrency assets, are compared with other benchmark models constructed based on different ideas. We find that the proposed quadratic decomposition VMD-Res.-CEEMDAN-SSA-ELM hybrid model demonstrates the optimal and most stable forecasting performance in both one-step and multi-step ahead prediction of the cryptocurrency return series.	predictive models;cryptocurrency;forecasting;data models;prediction algorithms;time series analysis;solid modeling;cryptocurrency;model selection;decomposition-ensemble;extreme learning machine;sparrow search algorithmempirical mode decomposition;performance

1468	实体经济	Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Blockchain-Assisted Software Defined Industrial Energy Market	Energy Internet (EI) is developing and booming rapidly with the increase of distributed energy resources, which is beneficial to address the severe condition of industrial energy. However, there are inevitable credit crises and utility optimization challenges in EI that need to be settled. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted software defined energy Internet (BSDEI), where a distributed energy market smart contract is designed to ensure transactions executed reliably and participants' accounts dealt accurately. In order to jointly optimize the utilities of operators, retailers, and industrial prosumers in BSDEI, we formulate the whole trading process as a three-stage Stackelberg game, with the proof of existence and uniqueness for the Stackelberg equilibrium. Then, we design a hierarchical distributed policy gradient algorithm to solve the Stackelberg game under incomplete information. We implement a blockchain-based industrial energy trading system using a middleware platform. The smart contract is deployed on the consortium blockchain, providing website interfaces for participants to operate. Furthermore, we conduct experiments for analyzing economic benefits. Our system prototype demonstrates the feasibility of BSDEI and the algorithm exceeds about 18% in total mean reward than comparing algorithms.	games;blockchains;smart contracts;software;costs;optimization;reinforcement learning;blockchain;industrial energy market;reinforcement learning;software defined network (sdn);stackelberg gameinternet

To this end, this study combines science mapping and bibliometric analysis of 696 articles published between 2015 and 2021 obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database. By drawing the reference co-citation map, bibliographic coupling map and co-word map with CiteSpace and VOSviewer tools, we identify the foundational themes, current status, and future research directions of blockchain literature in B&M. The results indicate that the blockchain research evolves from decentralized transaction and smart contract, and future research is focusing on the role of blockchain in financial risk management, organizational structure and the digital transformation of society.	blockchains;business;production;market research;couplings;software;visualization;business and management;blockchain technology;bibliographic coupling;co-citation analysis;co-word analysis;science mappingsupply chain;public-sector;governance;evolution;framework;dynamics;internet;trends;impact;fraud
1470	核心技术	A Multipath Payment Scheme Supporting Proof of Payment	Blockchain technology has always been plagued by performance problems. Given this problem, many scaling schemes have been put forward. A layer 2 network is a technology that solves the performance problem of blockchain. Connected parties in this network can set up channels to send digital currency to each other. Since the interaction with the blockchain is only required when the channel is established and closed, a large number of transactions do not need to be recorded on the blockchain, thus reducing the blockchain capacity. Due to the special structure of the payment channel, the distribution of funds in the channel is often unbalanced, which limits the route payment to a certain extent. This paper improves the original payment method in the second layer network by introducing new scripts. The new payment scheme supports proof of payment which is integral to the nature of the lightning network and divides the payment into several subpayments, so the large payment can be divided into relatively small payments. Due to the capacity limitation of the payment channel, theoretically, the success rate of the micropayment route is higher. This paper tests the new payment scheme on the simulated network and validates the nature of this solution to have a high routing success rate while supporting proof of payment.	
1471	虚拟经济	Development and Supervision of Financial Technology Based on Blockchain	Decentralization, stability, security, and immutability are all features of blockchain technology. Blockchain, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin's digital monetary system, is currently sweeping the globe. Blockchain is a revolutionary decentralized database technology that employs encryption, a timestamp chain data structure, a distributed consensus mechanism, and other technologies to achieve decentralization, tamper resistance, easy tracking, and programmable smart contracts. In the face of rising financial technology, we must maintain inclusive, technological, and invasive regulatory principles that not only foster financial innovation, but also conduct dynamic supervision to avoid systemic financial hazards. The consensus algorithm is one of the main blockchain technologies that has a direct impact on the system's functioning. As a result, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based development and supervision method for financial technology, as well as an application of this technology to commercial settlement, which can significantly reduce data complexity, time consumption, and the structural chain phenomenon in existing transaction settlement. We bring the idea of pow competition into DPoS, construct a consensus algorithm with an upgrade mechanism, and call it delegated proof of work, based on an in-depth investigation of the working principle of pow (proof of work) (dDPoS). The blocking efficiency of the dDPoS consensus method is around one block every 10 seconds, which is significantly higher than the blocking efficiency of the POW and POS consensus algorithms. As a result, it offers a potential answer to traditional centralized institutions' concerns of high brokerage costs and insecure central storage, as well as a wide range of application possibilities.	framework
1472	虚拟经济	Graph-Based LSTM for Anti-money Laundering: Experimenting Temporal Graph Convolutional Network with Bitcoin Data	Elliptic data-one of the largest Bitcoin transaction graphs-has admitted promising results in many studies using classical supervised learning and graph convolutional network models for anti-money laundering. Despite the promising results provided by these studies, only few have considered the temporal information of this dataset, wherein the results were not very satisfactory. Moreover, there is very sparse existing literature that applies active learning to this type of blockchain dataset. In this paper, we develop a classification model that combines long-short-term memory with GCN-referred to as temporal-GCN-that classifies the illicit transactions of Elliptic data using its transaction's features only. Subsequently, we present an active learning framework applied to the large-scale Bitcoin transaction graph dataset, unlike previous studies on this dataset. Uncertainties for active learning are obtained using Monte-Carlo dropout (MC-dropout) and Monte-Carlo based adversarial attack (MC-AA) which are Bayesian approximations. Active learning frameworks with these methods are compared using various acquisition functions that appeared in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, MC-AA method is the first time to be examined in the context of active learning. Our main finding is that temporal-GCN model has attained significant success in comparison to the previous studies with the same experimental settings on the same dataset. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the provided acquisition functions using MC-AA and MC-dropout and compare the result against the baseline random sampling model.	temporal gcn;uncertainty estimation;active learning;bitcoin data;anti-money laundering
1473	实体经济	Exploiting European GNSS and Ethereum in location proof systems	Location-Based Services (LBSs) are essential in many application contexts like ride-sharing or navigation apps. There are cases where users could gain an advantage by submitting fake locations. The problem faced in this paper concerns the possibility that the geographic location declared by a user is not the actual location in which the user is placed. Some solutions are based on centralized or distributed verification in the literature, and other solutions are based on witnesses or infrastructure. In this paper, we highlight the limitations of such approaches and propose a new scheme that exploits signals coming from satellites to provide trustworthy location proofs, also respecting users' privacy. The proposed approach is decentralized because location proofs are stored by users in a suitably-encrypted way, and a blockchain is adopted to guarantee data integrity and authenticity. We show that the proposed approach overcomes the state of the art through a detailed analysis.	localization;location privacy;location-based services;blockchain;galileosecure
1474	实体经济	Blockchain in construction management: Applications, advantages and limitations	Blockchain technology (BCT) has been implemented in different industries, including healthcare, manufacturing and construction. Integrating recent technologies such as the internet of things (IoT), building information modeling (BIM), and artificial intelligence with BCT creates the potential for overcoming many limitations within the construction industry. Blockchain smart contracts, for example, can solve problems related to traditional contract forms. In construction projects, smart contracts based on BCT can enhance payment transparency, protect transaction histories, and provide secure access to information. Since BCT platforms are decentralized, reducing unnecessary bureaucracy will improve open communications, and BCT application can prevent disputes rooted in communication issues, inaccurate documentation, and payment problems. This study focuses on reviewing BCT characteristics to evaluate impacts on mitigating disputes. Based on a systematic review of the publications, a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications in managing construction disputes is presented. This review identifies gaps in research and opportunities for future studies in the construction domain.	artificial intelligence (ai);blockchain technologies;building information modeling;construction and infrastructure;contractual disputes;project stakeholders;review article;smart contractssmart contract;big data;internet;technology;industry;system;claims;trust
1475	实体经济	Revolutionizing E-Commerce Using Blockchain Technology and Implementing Smart Contract	The days of storing data manually are behind us. We are opting for the online form of data storage and transfer. The new era of data digitization comes with its own perks and detriments. Cybersecurity is still a crucial concern today. As more data transfer occurs through an online medium, the risks of a breach and cyberattacks are inevitable. The whole foundation of e-commerce is based on the online transfer of goods and transactions without the need to travel. Transferring transactional data and transactions in e-commerce are prone to cyber threats. Our research's major objective is to develop a system that protects against such mishaps, especially during the transfer of transactional data, and also implement an automated system that ensures these transactions occur without any errors. To implement this, we are taking advantage of new emerging technologies called blockchain and smart contract. Blockchain allows a decentralized, immutable digital ledger to safely store and transfer data across the network. Blockchain technology is used in e-commerce to transfer transactions in a safe, secure, and faster way. Blockchain enables a peer-to-peer transaction system and data encryption that enables the safe transfer of transactional data. Blockchain is used to transfer transactional data. A smart contract is a special program that enables, verifies, and enforces the terms of a contract digitally. It provides transactional security as the contact is in place. The blockchain, coupled with smart contracts, will revolutionize the future of e-commerce. We have combined blockchain technology to ensure data security and user privacy with smart contracts to ensure that the protocol for the transaction is maintained. The results are presented by building and implementing the proposed system that provides the solution for transactional data privacy.	
1476	协同技术	Redactable Blockchain Trust Scheme Based on Reputation Consensus for MEC	Blockchain technology can build trust, reduce costs, and accelerate transactions in the mobile edge computing (MEC) and manage computing resources using the smart contract. However, the immutability of blockchain also poses challenges for the MEC, such as the smart contract with bugs cannot be modified or deleted. We propose a redactable blockchain trust scheme based on reputation consensus and a one-way trapdoor function in response to the problem that data on the blockchain, which is an error or invalid needs to be modified or deleted. The scheme calculates each user's reputation based on their currency age and behavior. The SM2 asymmetric cryptography algorithm is used as the one-way trapdoor function to construct a new Merkle tree structure, which guarantees the legitimacy of the modification or deletion after verification and vote. The simulation experiments show that the modification or deletion does not change the existing blockchain structure and the links of blocks. Furthermore, the consensus verification accurately passes after the modification or deletion operations, which indicates the proposed scheme is feasible.	
1477	协同技术	Secure and Personalized Edge Computing Services in 6G Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks	The customization of edge computing services is one of the key research fields in sixth-generation (6G) heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNETs). With various personalized requirements of vehicles on computation-intensive applications, how to explore the heterogeneous computing resources in the 6G HetVNETs to guarantee vehicles with the customized Quality of Experience (QoE), therefore, becomes a challenge. In this article, we develop a novel secure scheme to provide personalized edge computing services for moving vehicles (MVs) in 6G HetVNETs. In the scheme, a smart-contract-based secure edge computing architecture is designed by jointly considering the attack models and the characteristics of the 6G network infrastructures (e.g., satellites, drones, base stations, and roadside units), where each network infrastructure manages a number of parking vehicles to complete computing services collaboratively. With this architecture, based on the available computing resources owned by different network infrastructures, the collaborative computing resource allocation algorithm is designed to help each network infrastructure decide a customized service strategy (CSS) to satisfy the QoE of MVs. After deciding the CSSs, a model based on the second price-sealed auction is formulated to describe the competition among the network infrastructures, where the Nash equilibrium of the game is obtained to guide their optimal bidding strategies to obtain the chance for completing the services. The security analysis and the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can defend against the attacks and lead to a lower cost for completing the services than the conventional schemes.	6g mobile communication;edge computing;computational modeling;task analysis;quality of experience;satellites;drones;game theory;personalized edge computing;sixth-generation (6g) heterogeneous vehicular networks (hetvnets);smart contract;space-air-ground-integrated networks (sagins)intelligent;consensus;challenges;blockchain

Its collections can be opened toand shared with the people through the Internet. However, centralized authoriza-tion, untransparent transaction information and risk of tampering data in tradi-tional digital rights management have a strong impact on system normaloperation. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based digital rights manage-ment scheme (BMDRM) that realizes a distributed digital rights managementand authorization system by introducing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and smartcontracts. To ensure the security and efficiency of transactions and authorization,we store all processing data in a high-security distributed ledger based on crypto-graphic signatures. We test our scheme on Ethereum private network and theexperimental results show that BMDRM is feasible and secure for digital rightsmanagement in museums.	museum;blockchain;non-fungible tokens (nfts);smart contract;digital rights management (drm)efficient;secure;iot
1479	虚拟经济	Toward Trustworthy DeFi Oracles: Past, Present, and Future	With the rapid development of blockchain technology in recent years, all kinds of blockchain-based applications have emerged. Among them, the decentralized finance (DeFi) is one of the most successful applications, which is regarded as the future of finance. The great success of DeFi relies on the real-world data which is not directly available on the blockchain. However, due to the deterministic nature of blockchain, the blockchain cannot directly obtain indeterministic data from the outside world (off-chain). Thus, oracles have appeared as a viable solution to feed off-chain data to blockchain applications. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study on oracles, especially on DeFi oracles. We first briefly introduce the application scenarios of DeFi oracles, and then we talk about the past of DeFi oracles by categorizing them into several types based on their design features. After that, we introduce five popular DeFi oracles currently in use (such as Chainlink and Band Protocol), with the focus on their system architecture, data validation process, and their incentive mechanisms. Then, we compare these present DeFi oracles from their data trustworthiness, data source trustworthiness and their overall trust models. Finally, we propose a set of metrics for designing trustworthiness DeFi oracles, and propose a potential trust architecture and a few promising techniques for building future trustworthiness oracles.	blockchains;insurance;soft sensors;feeds;flowcharts;finance;smart contracts;defi;oracles;blockchain;trustworthiness
1480	协同技术	Privacy-Preserving Data Mining on Blockchain-Based WSNs	Currently, the computational power present in the sensors forming a wireless sensor network (WSN) allows for implementing most of the data processing and analysis directly on the sensors in a decentralized way. This shift in paradigm introduces a shift in the privacy and security problems that need to be addressed. While a decentralized implementation avoids the single point of failure problem that typically applies to centralized approaches, it is subject to other threats, such as external monitoring, and new challenges, such as the complexity of providing decentralized implementations for data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a solution for privacy-aware distributed data mining on wireless sensor networks. Our solution uses a permissioned blockchain to avoid a single point of failure in the system. Contracts are used to construct an onion-like structure encompassing the Hoeffding trees and a route. The onion-routed query conceals the network identity of the sensors from external adversaries, and obfuscates the actual computation to hide it from internally compromised nodes. We validate our solution on a use case related to an air quality-monitoring sensor network. We compare the quality of our model against traditional models to support the feasibility and viability of the solution.	wsn;air quality;privacy;blockchain;data miningwireless sensor networks;data aggregation;inference
1481	协同技术	Research on Privacy Data Protection Based on Trusted Computing and Blockchain	Aiming at the problems of low protection accuracy and long time consumption in traditional privacy data protection methods, a privacy data protection method based on trusted computing and blockchain is proposed. Set up the Internet node secure transmission protocol through the trusted node uplink transmission protocol and the downlink transmission protocol, and according to the transmission protocol, combined with the blockchain technology, the ECC elliptic curve encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the amount of data existing in the blockchain, and the AES symmetric encryption algorithm is used to encrypt the private data that exists in the nonblockchain, thereby completing the protection of network private data. The simulation experiment results show that the privacy data protection accuracy of the proposed method is higher and the work efficiency is faster.	
1482	实体经济	Addressing the Challenges of Electronic Health Records Using Blockchain and IPFS	Electronic Health Records (EHR) are the healthcare sector's core digital strategy meant to improve the quality of care provided to patients. Despite the benefits afforded by this digital transformation initiative, adoption among healthcare organizations has been slower than desired. The sheer volume and sensitive nature of patient records compel these organizations to exercise a healthy amount of caution in implementing EHR. Cyberattacks have also increased the risks associated with non-optimal EHR implementations. An influx of high-profile data breaches has plagued the sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, which put the spotlight on EHR cybersecurity. One objective of this research project is to aid the acceleration of EHR adoption. Another objective is to ensure the robustness of the system to resist malicious attacks. For the former, a systematic review was used to unearth all the possible causes why the adoption of EHR has been anemic. In this paper, sixty-five existing proposed EHR solutions were analyzed and it was found that there are fourteen major challenges that need to be addressed to reduce friction and risk for health organizations. These were privacy, security, confidentiality, interoperability, access control, scalability, authentication, accessibility, availability, data storage, data ownership, data validity, data integrity, and ease of use. We propose EHRChain, a new framework that tackles all the listed challenges simultaneously to address the first objective while also being designed to achieve the second objective. It is enabled by dual-blockchains based on Hyperledger Sawtooth to allow patient data decentralization via a consortium blockchain and IPFS for distributed data storage.	blockchain;cryptography;electronic health record;privacy;security;distributed file systemehr;implementation;security;adoption;systems;scheme;issues
1483	协同技术	A Brief Review on Internet of Things, Industry 4.0 and Cybersecurity	The advance of industrialization regarding the optimization of production to obtain greater productivity and consequently generate more profits has led to the emergence of Industry 4.0, which aims to create an environment called smart manufacturing. On the other hand, the Internet of Things is a global network of interrelated physical devices, such as sensors, actuators, intelligent applications, computers, mechanical machines, objects, and people, becoming an essential part of the Internet. These devices are data sources that provide abundant information on manufacturing processes in an industrial environment. A concern of this type of system is processing large sets of data and generating knowledge. These challenges often raise concerns about security, more specifically cybersecurity. Good cybersecurity practices make it possible to avoid damage to production lines and information. With the growing increase in threats in terms of security, this paper aims to carry out a review of existing technologies about cybersecurity in intelligent manufacturing and an introduction to the architecture of the IoT and smart manufacturing.	cybersecurity;industry;internet of things;literature reviewsecurity-vulnerabilities;iot;blockchain;network
1484	协同技术	Blockchain-Envisioned Secure Authentication Approach in AIoT: Applications, Challenges, and Future Research	The Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is the amalgamation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, which are deployed there to improve the overall performance of the system. AIoT can be deployed to achieve more efficient IoT operations; thereby can improve human-machine interactions and provide better data analysis. AI methods can be used to transform IoT data into useful information for the better decision-making processes, and it further increases the overall usability of the system. AIoT frameworks are very useful and applicable in a variety of applications, like security and surveillance system, smart home, intelligent transportation system, smart farming, secure and safe healthcare monitoring, industrial automation and control, eCommerce, logistics operations and control, and many more. However, AIoT frameworks may have issues related to data security and privacy as they are vulnerable to various types of information security-related attacks. These issues further cause the serious consequences, like the unauthorized data leakage and data update. Blockchain is a specific type of database. It is a digital ledger of transactions, which is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems. It stores data in the form of some blocks, which are then chained together. Blockchain is tamper proof and provides more security as compared to the traditional security mechanisms. Hence, blockchain can be integrated in various AIoT applications to provide more security. A generalized blockchain-envisioned secure authentication framework for AIoT has been proposed. The adversary model of blockchain-envisioned secure authentication framework for AIoT is also highlighted that covers most of the potential threats of a kind of communication environment. Various applications of the proposed framework are also discussed. Furthermore, different issues and challenges of the proposed framework are highlighted. In the end, we also provide some future research directions relevant to the proposed framework.	artificial-intelligence;things;internet;iot;management;framework;scheme;threat;technologies;agriculture
1485	实体经济	Blockchain for Future Wireless Networks: A Decade Survey	The emerging need for high data rate, low latency, and high network capacity encourages wireless networks (WNs) to build intelligent and dynamic services, such as intelligent transportation systems, smart homes, smart cities, industrial automation, etc. However, the WN is impeded by several security threats, such as data manipulation, denial-of-service, injection, man-in-the-middle, session hijacking attacks, etc., that deteriorate the security performance of the aforementioned WN-based intelligent services. Toward this goal, various security solutions, such as cryptography, artificial intelligence (AI), access control, authentication, etc., are proposed by the scientific community around the world; however, they do not have full potential in tackling the aforementioned security issues. Therefore, it necessitates a technology, i.e., a blockchain, that offers decentralization, immutability, transparency, and security to protect the WN from security threats. Motivated by these facts, this paper presents a WNs survey in the context of security and privacy issues with blockchain-based solutions. First, we analyzed the existing research works and highlighted security requirements, security issues in a different generation of WN (4G, 5G, and 6G), and a comparative analysis of existing security solutions. Then, we showcased the influence of blockchain technology and prepared an exhaustive taxonomy for blockchain-enabled security solutions in WN. Further, we also proposed a blockchain and a 6G-based WN architecture to highlight the importance of blockchain technology in WN. Moreover, the proposed architecture is evaluated against different performance metrics, such as scalability, packet loss ratio, and latency. Finally, we discuss various open issues and research challenges for blockchain-based WNs solutions.	wireless networks;security;privacy;blockchain;distributed ledger technologyresource-management;trust management;5g networks;security;attack;challenges;internet;privacy;access;framework
1486	市场治理	Sharing Economy for Tackling Crypto-Laundering: The Europol Associated 'Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptocurrencies'	This article examines the compatibility of the Global Conference on Criminal Finances and Cryptocurrencies with a sharing economy model. The analysis is based on the claims presented in Europol documents and public statements of Europol executives that this initiative serves as a platform for knowledge exchange and building professional networks between public and private actors to tackle crypto-laundering. The article investigates the validity of these statements with the most prominent sharing economy concepts: low barrier accessibility, transaction cost and trust-building. The article employs each sharing economy concept on two beneficiaries of the platform-law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and non-governmental organizations-while scaling the platform's sharing economy level. Based on Europol documents, an expert interview and participant observation of the 5th Global Cryptocurrency Conference, the article's core argument is that these cryptocurrency conferences can be categorized as a 'partial' sharing economy platform. They reduce the transaction cost for public and private actors to share knowledge about the latest trends and threats about crypto-laundering and reduce transaction costs for networking. However, co-founders should consider integrating robust trust-building mechanisms that allow low barrier entry to the conference, which will facilitate more inclusive and optimized public-private partnerships (P3).	sharing economy;crypto-laundering;europol;public-private partnershipsconsumption;marketplaces;reputation;platforms;emergence;pathway;system
1487	市场治理	A Chemical Analysis of Hybrid Economic Systems-Tokens and Money	With the influence of digital technology in our daily lives continuously growing, we investigate methods with the purpose of assessing the stability, sustainability, and design of systems of token economies that include tokens and conventional currencies. Based on a chemical approach, we model markets with a minimum number of variables and compare the transaction rates, stability, and token design properties at different levels of tokenisation. The kinetic study reveals that in certain conditions, if the price of a product contains both conventional money and tokens, one can treat this combination as one composite currency. The dynamic behaviour of the analysed systems is proven to be dynamically stable for the chosen models. Moreover, by applying the supply and demand law to recalculate the prices of products, the necessity of previous knowledge of certain token attributes-token divisibility and token-money exchange rates-emerges. The chemical framework, along with the analytic methods that we propose, is flexible enough to be adjusted to a variety of conditions and offer valuable information about economic systems.	digital technology;blockchain;cryptoeconomic design;economic system;chemical analysis;tokens;token engineering
1488	核心技术	Quick Block Transport System for Scalable Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Over D2D-Assisted 5G Networks	This paper presents a quick block transport system for scalable Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) blockchain over device-to-device (D2D)-assisted 5G networks. The objective of the proposed system is to increase the transaction throughput and further enable the application of the blockchain to delay-sensitive 5G services. To this end, the system rapidly disseminates the block data to all the peers on the blockchain network. The blockchain network is organized with mobile edge cloud (MEC) server and mobile peers in the 5G network. To ensure a scalable and reliable blockchain architecture, the core functionalities of the HLF blockchain are appropriately distributed among the mobile edge cloud and each mobile peer. The MEC server handles core functionalities for the blockchain network, such as block generation and membership management. In addition, it is responsible for gathering the network status of all peers and organizing the overlay structure to be utilized to rapidly propagate the block with a low network cost. On the other hand, the mobile peers handle the endorsing and validating functionalities to prevent block data tampering in the blockchain network. Furthermore, locality-aware device-to-device networking is utilized in 5G network coverage to achieve faster block dissemination. The proposed system is designed to work seamlessly in an existing HLF blockchain framework with consideration of scalability and compatibility. It is fully implemented using the open-source HLF and OpenAirInterface. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed block transport system, it was evaluated in an actual 5G network as well as 802.11 network. The experimental results verified its feasibility.	blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;5g mobile communication;scalability;reliability;fabrics;throughput;blockchain;hyperledger fabric;overlay networks;d2d communications;mobile edge cloud;5g networksinternet
1489	实体经济	State-of-the-art solutions of blockchain technology for data dissemination in smart cities: A comprehensive review	The concept of a smart city has been introduced to address the shortfalls of urbanization. The aid of technologies in smart cities is envisioned to be the key initiative to mitigate these challenges. However, the technologies exposure imposes challenging issues for the traditional centralized data dissemination schemes in smart cities. Consequently, smart city is undergoing a transition to a decentralized system through the implementation of blockchain technology. This paper presents an extensive survey of blockchain applicability for data dissemination in smart cities. We focus on the components of smart: transportation, healthcare, education, energy and building in smart cities and analyze state-of-the-art work on the integration of these components with blockchain. We discuss the advantages and shortcomings of existing literature and evaluate the performance efficiency and the extent of security and privacy achieved. The analysis leads to our new design of a secure smart city data dissemination framework using blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive abstraction in the literature that can be utilized for the designation of future blockchain-smart cities data dissemination schemes with the inclusion of participating entities.

1491	实体经济	Fairness-Enabling Practices in Agro-Food Chain	Fairness in the agro-food system is an increasingly important issue. Ensuring fair and ethical practices in the agro-food chain is essential for sustainable, effective, and resilient agro-food systems. Identifying and understanding fairness-enabling practices and existing business applications in the agro-food chain is crucial to create a sustainable system. This research study is an extensive literature review analyzing academic and grey literature. Thus, this study aims: (i) to conceptualize fairness in the agro-food system; (ii) to identify the fairness-enabling practices contributing to a fair agro-food system; and (iii) to explore existing agro-food chain business applications relevant to achieving a sustainable and fair agro-food chain. Fairness-enabling practices have a vital role in achieving fairness in the upstream and downstream operational stages of the agro-food chain. On the one hand, the upstream cycle includes many elements, from a ban on unfair trading practices to ethical treatment to farmers, from transparency through technology and innovation to ensuring fair remuneration. The key goal is to improve the position of farmers in the chain. The study considers the following five upstream focused business applications to enable fairness practices: blockchain, cooperatives, interbranch organizations, business applications for small-scale farmers, and Fairtrade. On the other hand, achieving success in the downstream operational stage of the chain depends on fairness-oriented consumer food choice, consumer intention to buy fair food, consumer perceived value of fair food, and increased information and transparency on agro-food costs and price. This paper takes into account two consumer-focused business applications which provide downstream fairness practices: dual entitlement and dynamic pricing. To conclude, agro-food chain actors should learn how to find profit in fairness, and turn fairness-related costs into profitable business models.	fairness;ethics;business model;agro-food chainprice fairness;supply chain;buyer-driven;food-chains;justice;consumer;cost;perceptions;governance;inequity

1493	核心技术	Blockchain on Security and Forensics Management in Edge Computing for IoT: A Comprehensive Survey	Security and forensics represent two key components for network management, especially to guarantee the trusted operation of massive access networks such as the Internet of Things (IoT). As a core technology to provide low latency and high communication for IoT, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) pulls computing resources from remote cloud centers to devices. The process of MEC service involves three types of entities: devices, data generated by devices and digital evidence generated after the data interaction. These entities are fully distributed and difficult to protect through traditional, highly centralized security and authentication mechanisms. As a decentralized shared ledger and database, the emerging blockchain is considered to provide cooperative trust and collaborative action among multiple subjects while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data. Because of its anonymity, non-tampering and traceability, the blockchain arouses research on the combination of blockchain and edge computing for device security, data security and forensics in IoT. This survey analyzes the application of blockchain in MEC-IoT systems and mainly focuses on approaches and technologies to manage the security and forensics issues for IoT.

1494	核心技术	Assuring Anonymity and Privacy in Electronic Voting with Distributed Technologies Based on Blockchain	Anonymity and privacy in the electoral process are mandatory features found in any democratic society, and many authors consider these fundamental civil liberties and rights. During the election process, every voter must be identified as eligible, but after casting a vote, the voter must stay anonymous, assuring voter and vote unlinkability. Voter anonymity and privacy are the most critical issues and challenges of almost all electronic voting systems. However, vote immutability must be assured as well, which is a problem in many new democracies, and Blockchain as a distributed technology meets this data immutability requirement. Our paper analyzes current solutions in Blockchain and proposes a new approach through the combination of two different Blockchains to achieve privacy and anonymity. The first Blockchain will be used for key management, while the second will store anonymous votes. The encrypted vote is salted with a nonce, hashed, and finally digitally signed with the voter's private key, and by mixing the timestamp of votes and shuffling the order of cast votes, the chances of linking the vote to the voter will be reduced. Adopting this approach with Blockchain technology will significantly transform the current voting process by guaranteeing anonymity and privacy.	privacy;anonymity;electronic voting;blockchain;vote;distributed technologiescomprehensive survey;challenges
1495	核心技术	Flexible Threshold Ring Signature in Chronological Order for Privacy Protection in Edge Computing	Edge computing can process data at the network edge rather than in the remote cloud. To protect the security of the collected data, blockchain can be used in edge computing. Any request sent from an edge server requesting data storage is a transaction added into the blockchain, which should include the data owners' signature. For protecting the privacy of data owners, a threshold ring signature can be utilized for the blockchain. In this article, we propose a flexible threshold ring signature scheme in chronological order that has two advantages for solving the update problem and chronological problem in practice. Our scheme is a nontrivial extension of Yuen et al.'s signature scheme and has three security properties: unforgeability, anonymity, and chronological sorting. We prove our scheme without random oracles and test our scheme over the Intel Edison development platform simulating practical edge servers.	flexible threshold;chronological order;ring signature;privacy protection;edge computing;blockchainiot applications;internet

Therefore, to focus on seafood safety from firm and government in this event, we construct a game model to explore the technology-enabled ways to resolve conflict from domestic product and polluted product. Our analysis reveals the potential equilibrium strategy for the domestic product only and two types of products, respectively. Moreover, from the perspective of government punishment, the result shows the existing motivation of polluted product in the market. Finally, we also investigate the five aspects to find the changes of market share for domestic product, including customer choice, product freshness, market uncertainty, geographical distance, and shoddy product, respectively. In summary, this research provides management implications to resolve conflict between two types of products and to realize the multi-party balance of interests and technology-enabled value.	nuclear polluted food;government punishment;social cognition;equilibrium strategy;blockchain-enabled market;market shareenvironment;design;power
1497	实体经济	Information Traceability Model for the Grain and Oil Food Supply Chain Based on Trusted Identification and Trusted Blockchain	The grain and oil food supply chain has a complex structure, long turnover cycles, and many stakeholders, so it is challenging to maintain the security of this supply chain. A reliable traceability system for the whole grain and oil food supply chain will help to improve the quality and safety of these products, thus enhancing people's living standards. Driven by the trusted blockchain and trusted identity concepts, this paper constructs an information traceability model for the whole grain and oil food supply chain, and it describes how contract implementation and example verification are performed. First, an information traceability model framework of the whole grain and oil food supply chain is established based on the survey and analysis of the grain and oil food supply chain. Second, trusted identification, blockchain master-slave multi-chain storage, and trusted traceability mechanisms are designed. The trusted identification mechanism is used to track the data information of the whole grain and oil food supply chain. The blockchain master-slave multi-chain storage solves the problem of miscellaneous information caused by many links in the whole grain and oil supply chain, while the credible traceability mechanism ensures the credibility of information collection, storage, and transmission. Finally, based on the data flow, the model operation process is analyzed. Using the information traceability model, the grain and oil food trusted traceability system is designed and developed with the Hyperledger Fabric open-source framework, and a case study is conducted to verify the system. The results show that the model and system constructed in this study solve the problems of low data security and poor sharing, which exist widely in the traditional traceability mechanism, and enable the trusted uplink, storage, processing, and traceability of multi-source heterogeneous information in the lifecycle of the whole grain and oil food supply chain. The proposed system improves the granularity and accuracy of grain and oil food traceability, and provides support for the strategic security of grain stock.	grain and oil food;information traceability model;trusted blockchain;trusted identification;hyperledger fabric;food safetywhole grains;system;supervision;internet;things

The question of how to realize the research on the innovation mode of logistics management of the e-commerce platform with the integration of "Internet of things + blockchain" is the current development trend. Based on this, this paper studies the influencing factors of logistics management of an e-commerce platform under the discrete analysis strategy of "Internet of things + blockchain." First, the logistics management analysis model of an e-commerce platform integrating "Internet of things + blockchain" is proposed.

The author designed a strategy management contract based on the Bloom filter, as a probabilistic data structure with extremely high space utilization efficiency and proposed the strategic management contract (PAP CONTRACT) and the strategic decision contract (PDP CONTRACT). In this way, the nontampering, auditability, and verifiability of the access control information are guaranteed; then, the access control method based on smart contracts is adopted to realize the user-driven, whole-process transparent, and dynamic and automatic access control of big data resources. The simulation results show that the greater the ratio of n/k, the better the optimization effect, and the greater the ratio, the lower the corresponding misjudgment rate, but it will also take up more space costs. At the same time, the true value of the false positive rate is generally less than the theoretical value of the false positive rate. When the performance of Hash (strategy to retrieve) is better, the result of Hash distribution is more uniform. Under the condition of m = 3, the misjudgment rate acceptable for the expected use can be achieved, and the increase in the number of Hashes will not bring a significant increase in revenue. Freed from the traditional model of providing access control services based on third parties, solve the problem of transparency of authority judgments; at the same time, through smart contracts, based on the strategy published by the resource owner on the blockchain, realize automatic access control to big data resources; and make the judicial process more flexible and the judgment result more credible. The BBAC-BD mechanism realizes a safe, reliable, and transparent new access control architecture, and it can effectively promote the safe circulation and sharing of big data.	scheme;management

1502	协同技术	Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Networking Strategy for Dynamic Wireless Charging of EVs	Dynamic wireless charging of electric vehicles (EVs) enables the exchange of power between a mobile EV and the electricity grid via a set of charging pads (CPs) deployed along the road. Accordingly, dynamic charging coordination can be introduced for a group of mobile EVs to specify where each EV can charge (i.e., from which CPs). This coordination mechanism maximizes the satisfied charging requests given the limited available energy supply. Upon specifying the optimal set of pads for a given EV, a fast authentication mechanism is required between the EV and the CPs to start the charging process. However, both the coordination and authentication mechanisms require exchanging private information, e.g., EV identities and locations. Hence, there is a need for a strategy that enables privacy-preservation in dynamic charging via supporting: (i) user anonymity and (ii) data unlinkability. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and scalable networking strategy based on a specially designed private blockchain that can support the privacy requirements of dynamic charging coordination, authentication, and billing. The proposed networking strategy relies on group signature and distributed random number generators to support the desirable features. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and low complexity of the proposed blockchain-based networking strategy.	authentication;blockchains;privacy;vehicle dynamics;costs;roads;homomorphic encryption;blockchain;dynamic charging;privacy;authentication;distributed random number generationelectric vehicles;secure framework;scheme;authentication;internet;systems;iot
1503	实体经济	Efficient Medical Big Data Management With Keyword-Searchable Encryption in Healthchain	Along with applying blockchain technology in the health care service system (HSS), many distributed solutions have been proposed to solve the centralized, data island problems. Although blockchain-enabled HSS has significantly changed the traditional management mode of medical Big Data [e.g., electronic medical records (EMRs)], some new problems such as ledger corpulence, data searchable security, and quantum attack threat are exposed. In this article, we first introduce an efficient EMRs management model called on-chain ledger and off-chain storage (OLOS), in which the indexes of EMRs are uploaded on public blockchain and the real EMRs data are stored in native server. This model can relieve the public ledger and save the public cloud space. Meanwhile, it can protect data security by keeping off the direct operation on real EMRs data. Then, to protect the cross-institutional EMRs sharing security and improve the quantum-resist ability, we proposed a secure keyword-searchable attribute-based encryption (KS-ABE) scheme based on lattice cryptography. Moreover, the scheme can prove to be secure against adaptive chosen-keyword attack and adaptive chosen-policy attack in the random oracle model. Besides, comparison analysis and experimental results show that our KS-ABE scheme has fewer communication costs and smaller key sizes than similar literary works.	security;lattices;cryptography;access control;blockchains;indexes;servers;blockchain;data searchability;health care service system (hss);medical big data;quantum-resist securityattribute-based signcryption;blockchain;internet;lattice;scheme

1505	协同技术	Stochastic Analysis of Double Blockchain Architecture in IoT Communication Networks	In this article, we present practical stochastic modeling and detailed performance analysis of our double blockchain (DBC) from Hao et al. (2021) for secure information and reputation data management in large-scale wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Specifically, the DBC is a private blockchain deployed on a cloud-fog communication network which is composed of an information blockchain (IBC) storing large amounts of IoT data in the cloud layer and a reputation blockchain (RBC) storing reputation data of the IoT devices in the near-terminal fog layer. The locations of the fog layer nodes are modeled according to a random Poisson point process (PPP) over a given 2-D area to approximate the stochastic property of real-world wireless node deployments. Furthermore, we assume that the number of IoT devices transmitting to the fog nodes also follow a random Poisson distribution. Based on these models, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the storage size, transmission latency, and tampering time of the IoT fog nodes in our DBC architecture. Numerical simulations highlight high storage scalability, low latency, and superior security of the DBC design, and provide insights into the performance gains for different fog node and IoT device densities.	blockchains;internet of things;interference;stochastic processes;smart contracts;scalability;security;double blockchain (dbc);poisson point process (ppp);trusted and secure internet of things (iot) networks;wireless communicationsinternet
1506	协同技术	Ensuring Data Freshness for Blockchain-Enabled Monitoring Networks	The Age of Information (AoI) is a recently proposed metric for quantifying data freshness in real-time status monitoring systems, where timeliness is of importance. In this article, the problem of characterizing and controlling the AoI is studied in the context of blockchain-enabled monitoring networks (BeMNs). In BeMN, status updates from sources are transmitted and recorded in a blockchain. To investigate the statistical characteristics of the AoI in BeMN, the transmission latency and the consensus latency are first rigorously modeled. Then, the average AoI, the AoI violation probability, and the peak AoI violation probability are derived in a closed form so as to quantify the performance of BeMN. Furthermore, a simplified form is derived for the AoI violation probability, and it is shown that this quantity can capture the upper or lower bounds of the actual AoI violation probability. Simulation results show that each BeMN parameters (i.e., target successful transmission probability, block size, and timeout) can have conflicting effects on the AoI-related performance. Subsequently, design insights are provided to maintain the freshness of the status data in BeMN. Then, experimental results with a real Hyperledger Fabric platform further validate the accuracy of our modeling and analysis.	blockchains;monitoring;data integrity;peer-to-peer computing;distributed ledger;probability;real-time systems;age of information (aoi);blockchain;hyperledger fabric (hlf);latency;stochastic geometrysensor network;age;information;iot;internet
1507	协同技术	Advanced encryption schemes in multi-tier heterogeneous internet of things: taxonomy, capabilities, and objectives	The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming widespread in different areas such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. IoT networks comprise many diverse entities, including smart small devices for capturing sensitive information, which may be attainable targets for malicious parties. Thus security and privacy are of utmost importance. To protect the confidentiality of data handled by IoT devices, conventional cryptographic primitives have generally been used in various IoT security solutions. While these primitives provide just an acceptable level of security, they typically neither preserve privacy nor support advanced functionalities. Also, they overly count on trusted third parties because of some limitations by design. This multidisciplinary survey paper connects the dots and explains how some advanced cryptosystems can achieve ambitious goals. We begin by describing a multi-tiered heterogeneous IoT architecture that supports the cloud, edge, fog, and blockchain technologies and assumptions and capabilities for each layer. We then elucidate advanced encryption primitives, namely wildcarded, break-glass, proxy re-encryption, and registration-based encryption schemes, as well as IoT-friendly cryptographic accumulators. Our paper illustrates how they can augment the features mentioned above while simultaneously satisfying the architectural IoT requirements. We provide comparison tables and diverse IoT-based use cases for each advanced cryptosystem as well as a guideline for selecting the best one in different scenarios and depict how they can be integrated.	cryptosystems;internet of things;privacy preserving;blockchain;confidentiality;securityproxy re-encryption;generalized key delegation;access-control;iot security;homomorphic encryption;computing paradigm;mobile iot;blockchain;cloud;challenges

As a result, studying IoT security dangers and viable countermeasures can aid academics in discovering acceptable solutions to various cybercrime investigation challenges. In this study, various security vulnerabilities at each layer are also examined in-depth and corrective options for smart city applications and Industry 4.0. A comparison analysis of IoT/IIoT wireless communication features and security challenges in IoT systems is also part of this study. The relevance of IoT forensics in cybercrime investigation in many areas such as smart homes, smart cities, automated cars, and healthcare is also discussed in this study.

1509	协同技术	Blockchain-Enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Performance Optimization on the Internet of Things	Internet of Things (IoT) networks are rapidly expanding, which requires adequate and reliable infrastructure and a large amount of data. The IoT device security and technical confidentiality may benefit from using Blockchain, a decentralised and trustworthy ledger. Increasing transaction throughput and coping with big data transfer situations is critical when dealing with significant volumes of IoT data on the Blockchain. Consequently, this research investigates the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) crucial functioning of the blockchain-enabled IoT structure, wherever transactions are instantaneously expanded and public divisibility is confirmed. It is important to note that DRL and Blockchain are two separate advancements devoted to the reliability and usefulness of system operation. These are both transactional systems. Technology integration into information exchange and research solutions is becoming increasingly critical. As a result of Blockchain, information may be exchanged securely and decentralised. When used in tandem with DRL, it can significantly improve communication efficiency. By combining DRL and Blockchain throughout the IoT, the author first presents a decentralised and efficient communication structure that allows for scalable and trustworthy information allocation and better performance than earlier options. The DRL approach assesses whether to offload and which service to dump to improve performance up to 87.5%. Furthermore, this method focuses on constructing an effective offloading mechanism for Blockchain-based communication systems to boost performance.	blockchain technology;deep reinforcement learning;internet of things;wireless communications;performance optimisationindustrial internet

Researchers from different disciplines (e.g., computer science, political science, information science, and linguistics) have also studied the dissemination, detection, and mitigation of fake news; however, it remains challenging to detect and prevent the dissemination of fake news in practice. In addition, we emphasize the importance of designing artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems that are capable of providing detailed, yet user-friendly, explanations of the classification / detection of fake news. Hence, in this article, we systematically survey existing state-of-the-art approaches designed to detect and mitigate the dissemination of fake news, and based on the analysis, we discuss several key challenges and present a potential future research agenda, especially incorporating AI explainable fake news credibility system.	fake news;feature extraction;social networking (online);artificial intelligence;computer science;taxonomy;support vector machines;artificial intelligence (ai) explainability;blockchain-based detection;deceptive content;deep fakes;fake news;misinformation;news propaganda;social bots;social mediaauthentication;vaccine;architecture;framework;consumers;security;covid-19;threat;media

Recently, many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used for COVID-19 detection, but they often require public data sharing with cloud data centers and thus, remain privacy concerns. This article proposes a new federated learning (FL) scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images for facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first propose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are trained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new FL solution, which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange learned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model for generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual data. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate a differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we propose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data analytics by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low running latency. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of our approach for COVID-19 detection over the state-of-the-art schemes.	covid-19;training;generative adversarial networks;data models;hospitals;servers;pandemics;covid-19;edge cloud;federated learning (fl);generative adversarial network (gan)blockchain;framework;consensus;internet;secure;ai
1512	实体经济	Exploring Implementation of Blockchain for the Supply Chain Resilience and Sustainability of the Construction Industry in Saudi Arabia	The construction industry plays an essential role in economic development since it is one of the largest industries all over the world. Blockchain has the potential to reshape the structure of all accessible networks in the future. Construction businesses are increasingly interested in embracing blockchain technology to improve supply chain sustainability performance and supply chain resilience in times of globally increasing risks and volatility. This study evaluates the readiness of actors involved in the producing of concrete goods to emphasize the necessity to bring blockchain into the construction industry, as it may be a solution for supply chain resilience and long-term sustainable growth. Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used in collecting and analyzing the data and testing the hypotheses. Data were collected using an online questionnaire distributed to 300 employees who work within the biggest concrete producing companies in Saudi Arabia. 120 respondents completed the questionnaires. Additionally, confirmatory semi-structured interviews with experts in supply chain financing, IT departments, and procurement departments have been conducted; the study's findings revealed a low level of blockchain knowledge within Saudi Arabia's construction industry, since (90%) of respondents have not worked with Blockchain technology. Several technologists barely understand it, and the level of readiness is very low. However, there is a lot of potential, and it is worth investing in it combined with other technologies such as BIM technology. In this study, the authors have sought to provide a measure of Saudi professionals' attitudes and understanding of blockchain technology solutions within the construction industry in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, the study's novelty aimed to provide a grasp of the conceptual, theoretical, and fundamental features of blockchain technology in the construction industry, as blockchain solutions could benefit the global economy by increasing levels of monitoring, tracing, and confidence in international supply chain resilience.	blockchain technology;sustainability;concrete producing;supply chain management;supply chain financing;construction industrytechnology;finance;challenges;model
1513	核心技术	PoTA: A hybrid consensus protocol to avoid miners' collusion for BaaS platform	The emergence of the blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform reduces the application barrier of blockchain technology. However, in BaaS, the transaction processing demand generated by BaaS users is continuous isolating from the transaction processing capability that comes from blockchain miner community. This results in the phenomenon that miner community spontaneously reduces the transaction processing capacity to obtain higher revenue, which is called the miners' collusion. The BaaS platform requires a new consensus protocol that prevent the miners' collusion while remain the security and immutability of blockchain. Based on this challenge, in this article, we propose a hybrid consensus protocol for BaaS called the Proof-of-Transaction Amount (PoTA). First, we theoretically analyze and formally define the miners' collusion. The existence of Nash-equilibrium collusion strategy has been proven. Second, the calculation method of the miner's effective collusion strategy space is provided to help determine whether the BaaS is facing the threat of collusion. Third, by organizing a transaction packaging committee (TPC) based on transaction amount, PoTA successfully avoids single-identity miners who have greater effective collusion strategy space obtaining the authority of transaction packaging. In the meanwhile, we redefine the reference relationship of blocks to enable cross-verification of PoW and PoS consensus. Finally, we prove our protocol can effectively avoid the occurrence of the miners' collusion. Control experiments prove the outperforms security and performance of PoTA in the comparison with PoW, PoS and other hybrid protocols.	blockchain-as-a-service;miners' collusion;game theory;consensus protocol
1514	实体经济	The role of traceability in end-to-end circular agri-food supply chains	The transition to a circular supply chain is a prerequisite for the agri-food sector to address growing consumer pressure for sustainability while meeting the required standards of quality and safety. Although traceability systems contribute notably to agri-food sustainability, their function as a core mechanism for monitoring and managing the transition from linear to circular supply chains has been neglected. Our objective in this study is to explore the role of traceability in the transition to sustainability-driven circular agri-food supply chains. We employ an end-to-end supply chain investigation, using a consumer-focused survey and a Delphi study of supply chain stakeholders from farm to shelf. Our results suggest that traceability plays a pivotal role in this process. The acceptance of traceability systems begins with the consumer and moves upstream, from fork to farm, acting as a catalyst through stakeholders' adoption towards a circular economy. A change at the consumer level drives changes in the supply chain and eventually at the company level. This study is the first to introduce a traceability angle to the current literature on sustainable agri-food supply chains and its transition to the circular economy.	categorical regression;holistic approach;blockchain;greece;consumer centric supply chainsustainable development;consumer perceptions;user acceptance;economy;system;waste;management;delphi;information;future

Such attributes formulate hindrances while analyzing and storing the data to generate apt aftermaths. Privacy and security are the colossal perturb in the domain space of extensive data analysis. In this paper, our foremost priority is the computing technologies that focus on big data, IoT (Internet of Things), Cloud Computing, Blockchain, and fog computing. Among these, Cloud Computing follows the role of providing on-demand services to their customers by optimizing the cost factor. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are the major cloud providers today.

The prospect of this research paper is to present the critical analysis and review it under the umbrella of existing extensive data systems. In this paper, we attend to critics' reviews and address the existing threats to the security of extensive data systems. Moreover, we scrutinize the security attacks on computing systems based upon Cloud, Blockchain, IoT, and fog.

1518	核心技术	Hybrid Smart Contracts for Securing IoMT Data	Data management becomes essential component of patient healthcare. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) performs a wireless communication between E-medical applications and human being. Instead of consulting a doctor in the hospital, patients get health related information remotely from the physician. The main issues in the E-Medical application are lack of safety, security and privacy preservation of patient's health care data. To overcome these issues, this work proposes block chain based IoMT Processed with Hybrid consensus protocol for secured storage. Patients health data is collected from physician, smart devices etc. The main goal is to store this highly valuable health related data in a secure, safety, easy access and less cost-effective manner. In this research we combine two smart contracts such as Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance with proof of work (PBFT-PoW). The implementation is done using cloud technology setup with smart contracts (PBFT-PoW). The accuracy rate of PBFT is 90.15%, for PoW is 92.75% and our proposed work PBFT-PoW is 99.88%.	pow;byzantine fault tolerance;iomt;cloud computing;health care datablockchain;challenges;framework;algorithm;internet;scheme
1519	虚拟经济	Home Environment Augmented Reality System Based on 3D Reconstruction of a Single Furniture Picture	With the popularization of the concept of "metaverse", Augmented Reality (AR) technology is slowly being applied to people's daily life as its underlying technology support. In recent years, rapid 3D reconstruction of interior furniture to meet AR shopping needs has become a new method. In this paper, a virtual home environment system is designed and the related core technologies in the system are studied. Background removal and instance segmentation are performed for furniture images containing complex backgrounds, and a Bayesian Classifier and GrabCut (BCGC) algorithm is proposed to improve on the traditional foreground background separation technique. The reconstruction part takes the classical occupancy network reconstruction algorithm as the network basis and proposes a precise occupancy network (PONet) algorithm, which can reconstruct the structural details of furniture images, and the model accuracy is improved. Because the traditional 3D registration model is prone to the problems of model position shift and inaccurate matching with the scene, the AKAZE-based tracking registration algorithm is improved, and a Multiple Filtering-AKAZE (MF-AKAZE) based on AKAZE is proposed to remove the matching points. The matching accuracy is increased by improving the RANSAC filtering mis-matching algorithm based on further screening of the matching results. Finally, the system is verified to realize the function of the AR visualization furniture model, which can better complete the reconstruction as well as registration effect.	3d reconstruction;instance segmentation;3d registration;furniture objectsregistration method
1520	技术治理	Phish Block: A Blockchain Framework for Phish Detection in Cloud	The data in the cloud is protected by various mechanisms to ensure security aspects and user???s privacy. But, deceptive attacks like phishing might obtain the user???s data and use it for malicious purposes. In Spite of much technological advancement, phishing acts as the first step in a series of attacks. With technological advancements, availability and access to the phishing kits has improved drastically, thus making it an ideal tool for the hackers to execute the attacks. The phishing cases indicate use of foreign characters to disguise the original Uniform Resource Locator (URL), typosquatting the popular domain names, using reserved characters for re directions and multi-chain phishing. Such phishing URLs can be stored as a part of the document and uploaded in the cloud, providing a nudge to hackers in cloud storage. The cloud servers are becoming the trusted tool for executing these attacks. The prevailing software for blacklisting phishing URLs lacks the security for multi-level phishing and expects security from the client???s end (browser). At the same time, the avalanche effect and immutability of block-chain proves to be a strong source of security. Considering these trends in technology, a block-chain based filtering implementation for preserving the integrity of user data stored in the cloud is proposed. The proposed Phish Block detects the homographic phishing URLs with accuracy of 91% which assures the security in cloud storage.	cloud server;phishing urls;phish detection blockchain;safe files;smart contract
1521	实体经济	Blockchain Framework for Cognitive Sensor Network Using Non-Cooperative Game Theory	The incorporation of technology in healthcare and hospital management has given a new perception to the medical procedures, and drug management for patient-centric care. Emerging technologies like blockchain, Internet of Things, and cognitive computing are most adaptable for designing smart healthcare systems. However, due to the diversified tasks involved, a design approach with broader understanding involving multiple factors that represent each area of the healthcare is the need of the hour. Game theory has gained prominence in modeling multi-player problems designated by strategic interdependency. This paper proposes a non-cooperative game strategy between players (stakeholders) to inspect how rationality is exhibited among the players who seamlessly try to get benefitted from the actions of other players. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed model, a prototype was designed based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain employing Raspberry pi IoT devices and sensor-based cognition. Use of blockchain brings in trust, security and transparency to the system. The simulation results show that the proposed model provides better outcomes in terms of latency (approximate to 15 min), throughput and scalability with an increased number of transactions. The comparative analysis elucidates the fact that the proposed method outperforms the existing healthcare systems with a significant improvement of 10-15% in terms of resource utilization and provides faster and accurate patient-centric services.	blockchain;cognitive sensors;game theory;healthcare;internet of things;securitychallenges;management
1522	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Identity Management Systems in Health IoT: A Systematic Review	Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems are crucial for any information system, such as healthcare information systems. Health IoT (HIoT) applications are targeted by attackers due to the high-volume and sensitivity of health data. Thus, IAM systems for HIoT need to be built with high standards and based on reliable frameworks. Blockchain (BC) is an emerging technology widely used for developing decentralized IAM solutions. Although, the integration of BC in HIoT for proposing IAM solutions has gained recent attention, BC is an evolving technology and needs to be studied carefully before using it for IAM solutions in HIoT applications. A systematic literature review was conducted on the BC-based IAM systems in HIoT applications to investigate the security aspect. Twenty-four studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria and passed the quality assessment were included in this review. We studied BC-based solutions in HIoT applications to explore the IAM system architecture, security requirements and threats. We summarized the main components and technologies in typical BC-based IAM systems and the layered architecture of the BC-based IAM system in HIoT. Accordingly, the security threats and requirements were summarized. Our systematic review shows that there is a lack of a comprehensive security framework, risk assessments, and security and functional performance evaluation metrics in BC-based IAM in HIoT applications.	security;medical services;systematics;bitcoin;internet of things;regulation;cloud computing;access control;blockchain;e-health;health iot;identity management;security;systematic literature reviewaccess-control;internet;things;technologies;challenges;framework;care
1523	实体经济	Proof of Activity Protocol for IoMT Data Security	The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an online device that senses and transmits medical data from users to physicians within a time interval. In, recent years, IoMT has rapidly grown in the medical field to provide healthcare services without physical appearance. With the use of sensors, IoMT applications are used in healthcare management. In such applications, one of the most important factors is data security, given that its transmission over the network may cause obtrusion. For data security in IoMT systems, blockchain is used due to its numerous blocks for secure data storage. In this study, Blockchain-assisted secure data management framework (BSDMF) and Proof of Activity (PoA) protocol using malicious code detection algorithm is used in the proposed data security for the healthcare system.

1524	协同技术	Blockchain enabled optimal Hopfield Chaotic Neural network based secure encryption technique for industrial internet of things environment	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) denotes a network of interlinked sensors, instruments, and other devices for industrial applications in the domains of manufacturing, logistics, transportation, etc. IIoT security is a major crucial research area for several applications. Image encryption techniques gained popularity in the recent years, thanks to increasing requirements for secure image transmission in IIoT environments. At the same time, conventional security solutions built for sensitive data protection are getting outdated in IIoT environment due to the participation of third party. Blockchain (BC) is one of the recent solutions used for security purpose which eliminates the involvement of a third party. With this motivation, the current research article presents a new BC-Enabled Shark Smell Optimization with Hopfield Chaotic Neural Network (SSO-HCNN) for secure encryption in IoT environment. The proposed SSO-HCNN model exploits a composite Chaotic Map (CM) which is integrated into staged logistic and tent maps to initially process the images and develop the variables needed for Arnold mapping. In addition, the SSO algorithm is developed with maximum PSNR and coefficient fitness function to select the optimum secret and public keys of the system amongst the random numbers. Besides, the diffusion phase utilizes HCNN to create a self-diffusion chaotic matrix whereas the jumbled image performs XOR operation using the keys to obtain the cipher image. In SSO-HCNN model, the cryptographic pixel value in the image is saved on BC thus guaranteeing the security and privacy of the images. To examine the superior performance of SSO-HCNN model over state-of-the-art methods, a set of	internet of things;shark smell optimization;self diffusion;chaotic neural;hopfield chaotic neural;networkdesign
1525	技术治理	Quantitative Comparison of Two Chain-Selection Protocols Under Selfish Mining Attack	The longest-chain and Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree (GHOST) protocols are the two most famous chain-selection protocols to address forking in Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain systems. Inclusive protocol was proposed to lower the loss of miners who produce stale blocks and increase the blockchain throughput. This paper aims to make an analytical-model-based quantitative comparison of their capabilities against selfish mining attack. Analytical models have been developed for the longest-chain protocol but less to the GHOST protocol. However, the blockchain dynamics and evolution are different when adopting different chain-selection protocols. Therefore, the corresponding analytical models and/or the formulas of calculating metrics (such as miner profitability and system throughput) may be different. To address these challenges, this paper first develops a novel Markov model and the formulas of evaluation metrics, in order to analyze a GHOST-based blockchain system under selfish mining attack. Then extensive experiments are conducted for comparison and we observe that: (i) The GHOST protocol is more resistant to selfish mining attack than the longest-chain protocol from the aspect of relative revenue of selfish miners. (ii) Inclusive protocol can promote the security (evaluated in terms of miner profitability) improvement of the system which has little total computational power or a high forking probability. Additionally, the longest-chain protocol is more sensitive to inclusive protocol than GHOST protocol. (iii) It is hard for each of the two common-used difficulty adjustment algorithms to achieve higher system throughput and security.	protocols;blockchains;throughput;analytical models;security;measurement;profitability;analytical model;blockchain;ghost protocol;inclusive protocol;proof of work;selfish miningblockchain;bitcoin;authorization
1526	法律治理	The unintended consequences of the regulation of cryptocurrencies	This paper investigates whether the application of the latest guidance of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for regulating cryptocurrencies may engender unintended consequences at odds with the initial purposes of transparency and technology neutrality. For instance, we will ask whether regulation strengthening may incite a category of investors to flight to unregulated and non-compliant decentralised exchange platforms to stay under the radar of regulators. Furthermore, we ask whether regulation may lead to a two-tier industry, fragmented between compliant trading venues that attract mainstream users and non-compliant trading venues that attract privacy-centric users. We argue that somewhat paradoxically, regulation may push part of the crypto-industry to the 'dark side' of financial innovation and drives privacy-centric investors out of the scope of regulators.	cryptocurrencies;decentralised trading;decentralised finance;regulationentrepreneurship;fragmentation;illiquidity;competition;bitcoin;institutions;efficiency;quality
1527	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Trustworthy Energy Dispatching Approach for High Renewable Energy Penetrated Power Systems	Renewable energy sources (RES) and low-carbon technology users play a vital role in modern power systems. However, RES generation is easily affected by the environment. Meanwhile, the load, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and prosumers, accounts for most low-carbon technology users. Their power is usually superimposed on peak loads without dispatching, which also exacerbates the instability of the power system. Current optimal dispatching mechanisms mainly rely on centralized organizations, while their dispatching process is not open and transparent. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based trustworthy dispatching approach for the distribution network in high renewable energy penetrated power systems. We first develop an optimal dispatching model considering EVs' charging behavior and the prosumers' economic benefits. With the model, prosumers can be dispatched to balance power and consume renewable energy, reducing the impact of disorderly charging on the grid and the abandonment of RES generation. An orderly charging iteration optimization (OCIO) algorithm is proposed to implement orderly EV charging while considering the charging cost and the period. We also propose a modified particle swarm optimization (mPSO) algorithm to publish dispatching tasks based on real-time power balance. Furthermore, blockchain is applied as an open and transparent ledger to record each entity's power generation and consumption information, ensuring that the dispatching process is trustworthy. Finally, the effectiveness of the dispatching approach is verified in the modified IEEE 33-bus test system and Ethereum-based smart contracts.	dispatching;blockchains;power system stability;renewable energy sources;distribution networks;costs;stability analysis;blockchain;electric vehicle (ev);optimal dispatching;prosumer;renewable energy power generationvehicles;management;flexibility;electricity;technology;chargers;future;model
1528	虚拟经济	MPCN-RP: A Routing Protocol for Blockchain-Based Multi-Charge Payment Channel Networks	Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are severely limited in transaction throughput and latency due to the need to seek consensus among all peers of the network. A promising solution to this issue is payment channels, which allow unlimited numbers of atomic and trust-free payments between two peers without exhausting the resources of the blockchain. A linked payment channel network enables payments between two peers without direct channels through a series of intermediate nodes that forward and charge for the transactions. However, the charging strategies of intermediate nodes vary with different payment channel networks. Existing works do not yet have a complete routing algorithm to provide the most economical path for users in a multi-charge payment channel network. In this work, we propose MPCN-RP, a general routing protocol for payment channel networks with multiple charges. Our extensive experimental results on both simulated and real payment channel networks show that MPCN-RP significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of time and fees.	peer-to-peer computing;routing;bitcoin;blockchains;lightning;costs;throughput;blockchain;payment channel network;routing

With the crisis created by the pandemic situation for the last two years, new ways of education have taken form to maintain the flow of learning and qualification; thus, the term "distance learning" has been implemented in all types of learning, from primary education all the way to tertiary education. This paper covers the image of tertiary education, mostly at the level of universities. Many changes took form at this level, such as developing new ways for the distance learning implementation by creating new programs dedicated for this new method of education. We will present to you how these changes took form and how they can evolve with the help of various technologies such as Blockchain and XR, and other strategic learning methods such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and gamification. Universities start to create new programs based on their unique crypto coin, which help students pay for their studies, such as articles, new disciplines, and exchange programs. The gamification of these programs raises the interactivity that students have during class hours, thus motivating them and creating an optimal curve of learning, combined with the implementation of XR technology.	blockchain;cryptocurrency;education;moocs;gamification;tertiary educationgamification;moocs
1530	核心技术	On Using Raft Over Networks: Improving Leader Election	Raft is a state-of-the-art consensus algorithm for state replication over a distributed system of nodes. According to Raft, all state updates occurring anywhere in the system are forwarded to the leader, which is elected among the system nodes to collect and replicate these updates to all other nodes. Thus, the time required for the state replication, named as system response time, depends on the delays between the leader and all other nodes. After multiple node failures and leadership transitions, each node can be leader with a probability that affects the expected response time. The leadership probabilities, in turn, are affected by the random intervals that nodes are waiting, after detecting a leader failure and before competing for the successive leadership. The Raft designers suggest the ranges of these intervals to be equal for all nodes. However, this may result in increased expected response time. In this paper, mathematical models are presented for estimating the ranges resulting in the desired leadership probabilities. The presented theoretical results are also confirmed by testbed experimentation with an open-source and widely used Raft implementation.	voting;time factors;leadership;delays;heart beat;protocols;open source software;raft;distributed-system;clustering;testbed-experimentationconsensus
1531	实体经济	A Framework to Make Voting System Transparent Using Blockchain Technology	A widespread mistrust towards the traditional voting system has made democratic voting in any country very critical. People have seen their fundamental rights being violated. Other digital voting systems have been challenged due to a lack of transparency. Most voting systems are not transparent enough; this makes it very difficult for the government to gain voters' trust. The reason behind the failure of the traditional and current digital voting system is that it can be easily exploited. The primary objective is to resolve problems of the traditional and digital voting system, which include any kind of mishap or injustice during the process of voting. Blockchain technology can be used in the voting system to have a fair election and reduce injustice. The physical voting systems have many flaws in it as well as the digital voting systems are not perfect enough to be implemented on large scale. This appraises the need for a solution to secure the democratic rights of the people. This article presents a platform based on modern technology blockchain that provides maximum transparency and reliability of the system to build a trustful relationship between voters and election authorities. The proposed platform provides a framework that can be implemented to conduct voting activity digitally through blockchain without involving any physical polling stations. Our proposed framework supports a scalable blockchain, by using flexible consensus algorithms. The Chain Security Algorithm applied in the voting system makes the voting transaction more secure. Smart contracts provide a secure connection between the user and the network while executing a transaction in the chain. The security of the blockchain based voting system has also been discussed. Additionally, encryption of transactions using cryptographic hash and prevention of attack 51% on the blockchain has also been elaborated. Furthermore, the methodology for carrying out blockchain transactions during the process of voting has been elaborated using Blockchain Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed system shows that the system can be implemented in a large-scale population.	blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;consensus algorithm;smart contracts;licenses;robustness;privacy;e-polling;voting system;blockchain application;blockchain voting;e-voting;electoral system;blockchain;cryptographic hash;secure voting
1532	协同技术	Blockchain and K-Means Algorithm for Edge AI Computing	The current development of blockchain, technically speaking, still faces many key problems such as efficiency and scalability issues, and any distributed system faces the problem of how to balance consistency, availability, and fault tolerance need to be solved urgently. The advantage of blockchain is decentralization, and the most important thing in a decentralized system is how to make nodes reach a consensus quickly. This research mainly discusses the blockchain and K-means algorithm for edge AI computing. The natural pan-central distributed trustworthiness of blockchain provides new ideas for designing the framework and paradigm of edge AI computing. In edge AI computing, multiple devices running AI algorithms are scattered across the edge network. When it comes to decentralized management, blockchain is the underlying technology of the Bitcoin system. Due to its characteristics of immutability, traceability, and consensus mechanism of transaction data storage, it has recently received extensive attention. Blockchain technology is essentially a public ledger. This is done by recording data related to trust management to this ledger. To collaboratively complete artificial intelligence computing tasks or jointly make intelligent group decisions, frequent communication is required between these devices. By integrating idle computing resources in an area, a distributed edge computing platform is formed. Users obtain benefits by sharing their computing resources, and nodes in need complete computing tasks through the shared platform. In view of the identity security problems faced in the sharing process, this article introduces blockchain technology to realize the trust between users. All participants must register a secure identity in the blockchain network and conduct transactions in this security system. A K-means algorithm suitable for edge environments is proposed to identify different degradation stages of equipment operation reflected by multiple types of data. Based on the prediction of the fault state for a single type of data, the algorithm uses the historical data of multiple types of data together with the prediction data to predict the fault stage. During the research process, the average optimization energy consumption of K-means algorithm is 14.6% lower than that of GA. On the basis of designing a resource allocation scheme based on blockchain, the problem of how the participants can realize reliable resource use according to the recorded data on the chain is studied. The article implements the verification of the legality of the use of blockchain resources. In addition, a control node is introduced to master the global real-time information of the network to provide data support for the user's choice.	
1533	技术治理	A Study on Characteristics and Identification of Smart Ponzi Schemes	A smart Ponzi scheme (SPS) is a financial Ponzi scheme that is implemented and deployed in blockchain through smart contract technology. It is built on treachery and lies, by which, the organizers and speculators jointly deceive innocent investors by fostering a belief in obtaining the expected benefits. The occurrence of SPSs is originated from the vulnerability of the supervision mechanism on the blockchain. Although there are many excellent studies, these contributions overemphasized the methods themselves, did not describe the characteristics of the SPS well, and had certain limitations in practice. We made a thorough study on the characteristics of an SPS and brought out the vital features to identify an SPS for an investor. Based on the analysis of the contributions of predecessors, we propose an approach to test whether a contract is an SPS. This approach could deal with two situations, the contracts to be deployed and the long-run contracts respectively. Of the approach, the priori method can be exploited to distinguish whether the contract to be deployed is an SPS for the runner of a blockchain; the posterior method could protect an investor from being trapped in a fraud. At the same time, the posterior method can also be extended to monitor some contracts dynamically to alert users with the probability to be fallen into SPSs.	contracts;smart contracts;blockchains;codes;investment;feature extraction;classification algorithms;blockchain;digital currency;smart contract;smart ponzi scheme

1536	实体经济	K-nearest neighbour-based smart contract for internet of medical things security using blockchain	Due to the fast-pacing development of technology in the healthcare domain, many problems arise surrounding the security and privacy preservation of medical data. Secure authentication on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is essential. The lack of security in critical and sensitive information of IoMT may lead to high-risk issues in patient privacy. When new data is transmitted from the sensor node, it cannot be assured as authenticated data. Therefore, a blockchain-based system is needed. Such a system allows healthcare providers to access the health records of patients in a more secured authentication-based approach across various network connections. In this paper, a new secure authentication approach using machine learning is proposed. To identify the dynamic time attack detection and authentication in an IoMT environment, this work implements K-Nearest neighbour (KNN) and machine learning using smart contract (KNN-MLSC). It improves security, reduces latency, and maintains health data privacy for both physicians and patients. The accuracy of KNN-MLSC got 0.96 compared with KNN using a smart contract. Also, the results showed that KNN-MLSC has the minimum computation time.	security;sensor;iomt;knn;machine learning;dynamic;blockchain;smart contract;health care data security;medical information privacy
1537	协同技术	Function Virtualization Can Play a Great Role in Blockchain Consensus	Bitcoin introduced a cryptocurrency as a form of public ledger consequently that turned into a most popular security technology, Blockchain. Its integrated mining technology lies the key security mechanism. The system allows forming a pool mining group to solve a particular job and share their revenues to their CPU usage while one of them successfully mines a block. To mine a block, a cryptographic puzzle should be solved, which requires significant compute resources that cause huge energy consumption. On the other hand, recent statistics show that low computational energy-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasing exponentially. Although it has low energy and limited computation power, it is large in quantity when it is integrated. So we focus on a stochastic geometry theory, which resolves the issue of block mining computation via utilizing multiple mobile IoT devices, given that these IoT devices are Computation Capable Nodes (CCNs). To further normalize this issue, we propose an efficient mathematical solution that uses smart coordination of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) for IoT devices to enable their CPU usage efficiently. At the same time, the work and credit point distribution policy is smartly handled through virtual pool mining. The proposal renders Network Function Virtualization technology to configure VNF, and Service Function Chain technology is utilized to enable the network flow of such VNFs. New algorithms are presented to solve multiple issues like node discovery, computation offloading, and work credit point distribution. Our goal is to minimize energy consumption within the given time constraint. Implementation results show that although virtual functions for block mining require extensive computations in IoT devices, dividing computation work into small fractions called tasks embedded with VNF, and offloading them to nearby CCNs, tend to minimize the cost and energy consumption of individual shared miners. The overall mining process is proved efficient and faster.	internet of things;task analysis;virtualization;blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;hardware;business;internet of things;network function virtualization;virtual network function;service function chain;blockchain;bitcoin;pool miningmobile;resource

Consequently, anonymity-related regulatory questions have naturally started to arise in terms of Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing compliance.

First, we can obtain different shocks of Bitcoin and crude oil returns based on empirical quantiles. Second, considering the different role that these shocks played in the causality between Bitcoin and crude oil, we conduct our research by testing the causality among different pairwise shocks. Further, given that these relationships may be changed at different time horizons, we also detect them from a frequency-domain perspective. Hence, we not only find the strong evidence of extreme risk transmission between Bitcoin and crude oil but also investigate the time-varying characteristic of this transmission, which may have a great impact on market participants and scholars related to Bitcoin-oil relations.	bitcoin;crude oil markets;granger causality;extreme risk transmission;time-frequency domainstock returns;energy;cryptocurrencies;price;causality;models;hedge
1541	市场治理	Examination of Bitcoin Exchange Through Agent-Based Modeling: Focusing on the Perceived Fundamental of Bitcoin	Bitcoin prices have fluctuated greatly, and news media have warned investors about a possible price bubble, arguing that the fluctuation arises mainly from people's blind pursuit of short-term trends. Despite these increasing concerns, however, only a few studies have addressed them. This article examines the problem using agent-based modeling. In our model, agents are designed to interact with one another in two ways: Price and social interactions. In their price interactions, agents adopt one of three strategies (fundamentalist, momentum trading, and contrarian trading) in investing at each time and adopt a strategy to maximize their expected benefits. In their social interactions, uninvolved agents become involved at various times based on their network properties (word-of-mouth effect). To examine the distinctive properties of Bitcoin from a comparative perspective, two representative currencies (Euro and Turkish lira) and two financial assets (Nasdaq and Nasdaq leverage index) are used in the agent-based model. The results show that the fraction of fundamentalists and price volatility have mutual Granger causal relationships overall. Also, no significant differences are found in the parameters of social interaction. These results are contrary to commonly held beliefs that Bitcoin prices are merely a result of blind pursuit and herding behavior.	bitcoin;agent-based modeling;market research;stock markets;agent-based modeling;bitcoin;computational finance model;simulation;word of mouthof-mouth ewom;network

We find that both market and funding liquidity shocks forecast future volatility. More importantly, liquidity shocks have a stronger and persistent effect on the longterm trend component of volatility. Exploiting the predictability of liquidity shocks, we propose a risk-managed strategy to manage extremely high volatility and avoid occasional large crashes in cryptocurrency markets. This novel strategy virtually eliminates crashes and improves the Sharpe ratio substantially against the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy. The outperformance is much stronger during the turbulent periods of cryptocurrencies. Hence, this paper provides important insights into cryptocurrency investment and portfolio management combining traditional assets and cryptocurrencies.	liquidity shocks;price volatilities;risk-managed trading strategy;cryptocurrenciesstock returns;market;uncertainty;exchange;predict;volume;model
1543	平台项目	ESS: An Efficient Storage Scheme for Improving the Scalability of Bitcoin Network	With the continuous development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin as the first cryptocurrency has drawn massive attention from various sectors. Bitcoin on-chain data storage is over 338GB as of September 1, 2021. According to the exponential growth trend of block data, the size of a Bitcoin full node will exceed 500GB in two years. The huge storage problem makes it difficult for general users to store complete Bitcoin data conveniently, which weakens the decentralization capability of Bitcoin network. In this work, we propose an efficient storage scheme (ESS) based on the distribution characteristics of the unspent transaction outputs in Bitcoin network. ESS sets a UTXO-weight for each block. According to UTXO-weight, it dynamically prunes the blocks which have lower query frequency, improving the scalability of the Bitcoin network. When a new block is generated, ESS enables joining nodes to verify most of the transaction inputs instantly. Only a small amount of transaction outputs of older blocks need to be retrieved from the full node for payment verification. Experimental results demonstrated that ESS can reduce the size of a normal node in current Bitcoin network by about 82.14% at a low communication cost.	blockchains;bitcoin;peer-to-peer computing;scalability;costs;throughput;technological innovation;blockchain;bitcoin;storage;prune;scalabilityblockchain;optimization
1544	核心技术	A Theoretical Model for Block Propagation Analysis in Bitcoin Network	Blockchains are currently gaining attention as a newly emerging technology in both academia and industry, capable of impacting a variety of domains beyond cryptocurrencies. Performance modeling can be used to provide us with a deeper understanding of the behavior and dynamics within blockchain peer-to-peer networks. Blockchain system architects can leverage network models to properly tune their system and to reduce design costs significantly. In this article, we focus on the original and well-established Bitcoin blockchain network. In particular, we propose a random graph model for performance modeling and analysis of the inventory-based protocol for block dissemination. This model addresses the impact of key blockchain parameters on the overall performance of Bitcoin. We derive some explicit and closed-form equations for block propagation delay and traffic overhead in the Bitcoin network. We also adapt our model to study the impact of deploying a relay network and investigate the effect of the relay network size on the network performance and decentralization. We implement our model using the popular network simulator OMNet++. We validate the accuracy of our theoretical model and its implementation with our dataset mined from the Bitcoin network. Our results show the tradeoff between the default number of connections per node, network bandwidth, and block size in order to compute the optimal block propagation delay over the network. Additionally, we found that bigger relay networks can jeopardize the decentralization of the Bitcoin network.	bitcoin;analytical models;propagation delay;relay networks (telecommunications);mathematical model;peer-to-peer computing;bitcoin;blockchain;cryptocurrency;distributed ledger technologies (dlts);peer-to-peer network;performance modeling;relay networks

P2P energy trading is beneficial to the grid as well as the connected peers. A blockchain-based smart contract is well suited to transparently facilitate trades between energy consumers and producers without the services of intermediaries. In this paper, Ethereum-based smart contracts that facilitate double energy auction and spinning reserve trading are developed with Solidity, compiled, and deployed within the Remix IDE. Willing energy sellers/buyers submit offers/bids to a contract that implements the double auction procedure. In order to fulfil energy supply obligations, sellers are also able to purchase spinning reserves via another smart contract. The smart contracts' effectiveness in performing the auction procedure and making payments is confirmed using an energy/reserve market scenario. The proposed scheme encourages further adoption of distributed energy resources and participation in local P2P energy trading.	blockchain;double auction;p2p energy trading;spinning reserve;smart contractmarket;system;power;model
1546	核心技术	Three-Dimensional Tradeoffs for Consensus Algorithms: A Review	Blockchain has been applied in many fields to solve the problems of trust, security, efficiency benefiting from its tamper-proof and traceability of data. However, it is still necessary to consider the technical constraints that limit the large-scale application of blockchain: scalability, security, and decentralization cannot be achieved altogether. Consensus algorithm is the core of blockchain, which determines the performance of blockchain system to a certain extent. The existing reviews or surveys mainly focus on processes of consensus algorithms, but fall short in covering the current trends and scenarios, thereby lacking intrinsic understanding of their design philosophy. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional tradeoff model and unearth various indicators of different dimensions to guide the construction of consensus algorithms. To summarize the existing efforts, we compare and analyze various classical consensus algorithms, and focus on the design principles of these algorithms under the multi-dimensional tradeoff model. According to different requirements, each algorithm has different tradeoffs. Furthermore, we provide different solutions for blockchain in different dimensions. Finally, we summarize the development trend of consensus design and the key technology prospects of blockchain. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first survey that accomplishes such goals.	blockchains;security;consensus algorithm;scalability;throughput;bitcoin;technological innovation;scalability;decentralization;security;consensus

However, few scholars have combined the blockchain with supply chain management. Based on blockchain, this paper explores the collaborative management of material supply chain for production and manufacturing job-shops (PMJs). Specifically, a collaborative management model was constructed, and the execution of the smart contract between PMJ and production material supplier (PMS) was explained. Then, the Stackelberg game between PMJ and PMS in the model was analysed, and the calculation method of the total benefit of PMS and PMJ was derived, under the information sharing mode of the blockchain-based PMSC model. Through trust evaluation, the dishonest companies were identified in the PMSC. To ensure the safe and reliable data sharing between the companies in our model, the probability for the dishonest companies to participate in smart contract was reduced, making it less likely for false shared data to appear in the chain. The effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based model for the collaborative management of PMSC was proved through simulations.	blockchain;production materials;supply chain;collaborative management

These constructs enable transactions in trustless environments using consensus algorithms and software-controlled verification rules. In the current state of the art, there is a shortage of works on the adaptability of smart contracts, and the re-use of their source code is limited mainly to cloning. The paper discusses the pattern of smart contract design and implementation with the overt declaration of verification rules. The author introduces two advantages of the pattern: Firstly, run-time reconfigurability of the list of smart contract verification rules to adjust for various transaction types. Secondly, the re-use of verification rules between different configurations of the smart contract, and among diverse smart contracts. The paper uses blockchain platform-independent stereotypes from a dedicated Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for designing smart contracts and verification rules. The implementation of the pattern is developed in object-oriented Java language. The pattern exploits polymorphism and controls inheritance by using sealed classes with permission for specialization only for selected final ones. Thus, the pattern ensures two recently highly desired properties in smart contract design and development: re-use and security. Moreover, the declared verification rules list facilitates test automation and reduces test preparation effort due to the re-use of test classes among smart contract configurations. The pattern usage is illustrated in the example of renewable energy exchange within the prosumers community and amid various communities.	smart contract;verification rule;object-oriented programming;design patternblockchain

Contemporary blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric offer support for smart contracts through consensus mechanisms such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) or other types of transaction validation and ordering services. This article exploits smart contracts in the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) blockchain platforms. In particular, we explore Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu, BFT blockchain platforms, and apply them to a decentralized e-prescription case study to evaluate their effectiveness. We adopt Hyperledger Besu and Tendermint in this research, given that both are BFT-based blockchains. Also, it is noteworthy that smart contracts in BFT blockchain platforms such as Tendermint are not well established and not widely adopted yet. Our article empirically evaluates the performance of smart contracts in Tendermint and Hyperledger Besu using a decentralized medical prescription case study and compares their results with Ethereum, a PoW blockchain. Our results demonstrate that BFT blockchain platforms are efficient for multistakeholder applications such as e-prescription and supply chains.

The cost-conscious and tech-savvy behavior of travelers has been resurrected in the 'new normal'; however, the fear of missing out (FOMO) is now dictating travelers' choices for newness, immersive and rewarding travel experiences. To address these emerging trends, promising new technologies, and untested relationships, the present study explored the effects of COVID-19 travel anxiety on the readiness for metaverse space travel. In addition, the moderating influence of tech savviness and travel FOMO was tested on this relationship. Drawing on data of international expats (N = 386) in UAE, the finding based on structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the international expat's readiness for metaverse space travel is positively influenced by their COVID-19 travel anxiety. Moreover, expats with high tendencies of travel FOMO and tech savviness will experience a stronger impact of COVID-19 travel anxiety on their readiness for metaverse space travel. These novel findings guided by prominent theories (e.g., self-determination, SOR, and protection motivation) offer new insights for policy makers and practitioners to strategically achieve digital-tourism transformation and sustainability through emerging and immersive metaverse technologies.	metaverse;space travel;digital tourism sustainability;tech savviness;travel fomo;covid-19 travel anxiety;virtual reality;post-covid-19 tourismtourism;technology;destination;motivation;model
1553	虚拟经济	Strategy for improving the football teaching quality by AI and metaverse-empowered in mobile internet environment	The metaverse has influenced the development of science and technology since it was proposed. While artificial intelligence (AI) is still one of the important technologies to solve problems in metaverse. The success of AI in various fields and the development of information technology make the integration of sports industry and AI an inevitable trend. Currently, the traditional physical education is experiencing qualitative changes, and the demand of integrating AI and metaverse into physical education is becoming more and more obvious. Football teaching is an important part of physical education, and Virtual Reality (VR) has the characteristics of immersion, interaction and imagination, which can build virtual and realistic football teaching process. In this study, through 360-degree panoramic VR football teaching videos empowered by the metaverse and K-means algorithm based on machine learning under AI, we study the strategies for improving the quality of football teaching in the mobile Internet environment. Therefore, we propose K-means based optimized 360-degree panoramic VR football teaching video delivery strategy. In addition, we conduct simulation experiments under content delivery networks simulator, and the simulation results show that the proposed strategy is superior to the baselines in terms of proxy server hit ratio, byte hit ratio, mean response time and students quality of experience. Moreover, through the 360-degree panoramic VR football teaching videos learning, students can intuitively analyze the actions and improve the teaching quality. The reconstruction of football teaching environment is beneficial to promote the combination of football teaching and smart learning.	artificial intelligence;virtual reality;metaverse;mobile internet;video delivery;football teaching;content delivery networks

The automation of programming and artistic functions is increasingly baked into game engines that work with other software applications in 3D production ecosystems, which are laying the foundations for what is being pitched by platform companies as the future metaverse. Platform studies has analyzed automated decision-making through the politics of classification. Game studies has investigated engines such as Unreal and Unity as platform tools that consolidate power through asymmetries of interconnectivity and interoperability. This commentary discusses the automaticity of game engines as platform tools for designing and simulating interactive 3D worlds within and beyond games. Outlining the structuring force of game engines from game development and entertainment media to architecture, engineering, construction, and manufacturing, I speculate on the implications of engines for game workers and game studies.	game engines;platform tools;3d real-time;metaverse;automation
1555	实体经济	Block-HPCT: Blockchain Enabled Digital Health Passports and Contact Tracing of Infectious Diseases like COVID-19	Due to its significant global impact, both domestic and international efforts are underway to cure the infection and stop the COVID-19 virus from spreading further. In resource-limited environments, overwhelmed healthcare institutions and surveillance systems are struggling to cope with this epidemic, necessitating a specific strategic response. In this study, we looked into the COVID-19 situation and to establish trust, accountability, and transparency, we employed blockchain's immutable and tamper-proof properties. We offered a smart contract (SC)-based solution (Block-HPCT) that has been successfully tested to preserve a digital health passport (DHP) for vaccine recipients; also, for contact tracing (CT) we employed proof of location concept, which aids in a swift and credible response directly from the appropriate healthcare authorities. To connect on-chain and off-chain data, trusted and registered oracles were integrated and to provide a double layer of security along with symmetric key encryption; both Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric were merged as storage center. We also provided a full description of the suggested solution's system design, implementation, experiment results, and evaluation (privacy and cost analysis). As per the findings, the suggested approach performed satisfactorily across all significant assessment criteria, implying that it can lead the way for practical implementations and also can be used for similar types of situations where contact tracing of infectious can be crucial.	digital health passports;contact tracing;vaccination certificates;covid-19;infectious disease;blockchain;smart contracts;ipfs;hyperledger fabricvaccination certificates
1556	协同技术	A secure blockchain system for Internet of Vehicles based on 6G-enabled Network in Box	Network in Box (NIB) is a self-organizing and portable device. The six-generation wireless communication technologies (6G) can empower NIB with better spectrum efficiency by integrating satellite broadcasting. 6G enabled NIB is promising to promote the communication efficiency of Internet of Vehicles (IoV). IoV has emerged as the concrete practice of intelligent transportation. However, IoV is vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers because they use traditional RSA and elliptic cure cryptographic systems. Therefore, it is critical to improving the security of IoV against quantum computer attacks. This paper proposes the first secure scheme based on post-quantum techniques for 6G-enabled NIB to protect IoV against quantum attacks. On the one hand, a blockchain-based public key infrastructure is proposed to authenticate the IoV devices securely. On the other hand, we design a blockchain-based multi-party key agreement and communication system to support multi-party communication among IoV devices. The extensive theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed blockchain system based on 6G-enabled NIB can achieve high security and efficiency for IoV.	blockchain;internet of vehicles;6g-enabled network in box;multi-party communication;post-quantum secure schemesybil attack;management;state;transportation;infrastructure;scheme;model

A quantitative survey with 1034 respondents was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM). Empirical results indicate that multiple antecedents are associated with privacy concerns in the digital euro that in turn influence intention to adopt a digital euro. Especially soft trust factors such as credibility and image are found to influence both privacy concerns and the intention to adopt a digital euro. It contributes to the current literature by introducing trust as a second-order construct composed of hard and soft trust factors for digital currencies. The results provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners aiming at designing and implementing CBDCs by demonstrating which factors need to be considered in order to achieve widespread adoption by citizens.	digital euro;central bank digital currency;cbdc;trust;privacy concerns;electronic payment systemsinformation privacy;protection motivation;pls-sem;user acceptance;self-disclosure;mobile payment;calculus model;e-commerce;adoption;personality

Evidence from Twitter	Researchers and practitioners increasingly use posts on Twitter as an additional source of information to analyze cryptocurrency price movements. Previous studies that focus on the stock markets have shown that corporate sentiment disclosure impacts stock returns and trading volume. This study explores the reaction of the cryptocurrency market to the Twitter sentiments of issuers. It is found that cryptocurrency prices react positively to Twitter sentiments, while the trading volume reacts positively to the absolute value of the Twitter sentiments in a timely manner (within a period of 24 h). Further analysis in this study reveals that the market reactions are mainly driven by the incremental change in sentiments found in Twitter posts.

1559	核心技术	A blockchain-based secure data-sharing framework for Software Defined Wireless Body Area Networks	In the past few years, blockchain has proven its necessity and unprecedented prospects in providing a secure environment for information exchange between two parties. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) with blockchain has enabled a digital transformation in many areas such as healthcare, supply chain, and financial services. Like blockchain, the programmable Software-Defined Network (SDN) is also achieving popularity due to its ability to reduce network management complexity. It is evident that incorporating SDNs with IoT-based healthcare systems can significantly improve healthcare management services. However, there are a number of challenges such as data confidentiality, user-centric design, integrity and privacy that makes it difficult to share sensitive information among different parties in a healthcare system. To overcome these challenges, we propose an architectural framework that incorporates blockchain with Software-Defined Wireless Body Area Networks (SDWBANs) to facilitate secure data sharing. We have also designed and integrated a smart contract based fine-grained access control policy to ensure that only data owners will have full control over their health data. The experimental outcomes show that the proposed model achieves good throughput and incurs a very low overhead in terms of latency compared to traditional cloud-based systems.	blockchain;sdn;wban;sdwban;data sharing;smart contract;access control
1560	实体经济	A game theoretic approach of optimal adoption time of blockchain: A case of ship operators	With increasing uncertainties in the global economy, companies are facing fierce competition. Blockchain has the potential to enhance companies' competitiveness by streamlining processes, improving productivity and reducing costs. It is meaningful to study whether and when companies would adopt blockchain and under what conditions. We develop a game theoretic model to analyse the introduction of blockchain to companies from a big customer with bargaining power. In this study, ship operators need to decide their optimal adoption time when facing a request from a big shipper to adopt blockchain with a threat of substitution policy from the shipper. An algorithm is developed to obtain the numerical solutions of ship operators' optimal adoption time. Our analysis suggests that 1) the substitution policy only matters to small companies and is only necessary under fixed pricing model; 2) a threshold applies for substitution ratio and cut-off time to effectively induce small companies to adopt blockchain early; 3) blockchain developers should consider mixed pricing model instead of fixed pricing model for faster and wider blockchain adoption; 4) blockchain initiators should focus more on improving the technology's cost-effectiveness rather than rely heavily on externalities like substitution policies to promote blockchain adoption.	blockchain;adoption time;game theory;maritimetechnology;management;decisions;diffusion;framework;market

Massive amounts of data with different types involved in the oil and gas industry can be obtained through IoT (Internet of Things) devices, supported by Blockchain technology with characteristics of immutability and credibility in distributed storage. Hence, credible data will be rationally used in Big Data analysis and Artificial Intelligence implementation.

1562	协同技术	A privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning method based on blockchain	As a novel distributed learning mechanism, federated learning has drawn widespread attention by allowing multiple parties to train an accurate model collaboratively without collecting their raw data. However, it relies on a trustworthy central server that still suffers from severe security challenges, such as model inversion attack and single point of failure. Thereby, a privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning method based on blockchain is proposed to enable fully decentralized and reliable federated learning in untrusted network. In our scheme, we propose a secure aggregation protocol to guarantee the confidentiality of gradients while supporting clients dropping out during the workflow, and design a novel blockchain structure enabling global gradient verification to defend against potential tampering attack. In addition, a gradient compression method is proposed to reduce the communication overhead. Security analysis shows that our scheme can preserve the privacy by adding pairwise random masks to the gradients, and prevent Sybil attack by reasonable threshold setting in verifiable secret sharing. Experimental results on two real-world datasets illustrate that when the clients' dropout rate is less than 20%, our scheme can achieve almost the same accuracy as original federated learning, and performs better than similar blockchain-based federated learning methods in terms of computation overhead and communication overhead.	federated learning;blockchain;verifiable secret sharing;polynomial commitment;tampering attacksecure;internet
1563	实体经济	A Scientific Research Information System via Intelligent Blockchain Technology for the Applications in University Management	The scientific research information system plays an essential role in improving management efficiency and promoting technological innovation in universities. With the increasing computational demand for human-centric research management, blockchain technology, with distributed storage, consensus sharing, and security traceability, has efficiently assisted the research information system in dealing with various issues such as big-data scale, information security, interconnection, rapid response, and private security. A novel scientific information system framework based on intelligent blockchain technology is proposed to promote university scientific research's information level and management efficiency. Moreover, four smart data contracts, including data collection, verification, sharing, and supervision, are custom-designed under an efficient scientific research information system. Those intelligent contracts provide reliable data security and traceability algorithms to guarantee the practical application of the scientific research information system. The results show that the constructed system can relieve the centralized storage pressure of scientific research information and solve the cross-subject sharing obstacle of massive safety data among different systems. Thereby, the system increases the transparency of scientific evaluation and realizes the credible supervision of scientific research information, which provides a way to promote the innovative application of blockchain technology in scientific research management in colleges and universities.	traceability;education;design;iot
1564	虚拟经济	A Blockchain-Based Digital Asset Platform with Multi-Party Certification	Assets such as warehouse receipts are important for enterprises, which can be used to pledge in supply chain finance (SCF). However, traditional pledges are performed manually, which inevitably encounters inefficiency and security problems such as multiple pledges. To improve asset security, we propose a blockchain-based digital asset platform (BDAP) with multi-party certification. BDAP not only has a security protocol based on the threshold ECDSA algorithm to make related participants confirm the authenticity of assets but also embeds a Verifiable Byzantine Fault Tolerant (VBFT) mechanism, randomly selecting the consensus nodes and improving the safety of the nodes. Moreover, data stored on the blockchain makes traceability possible. Through a set of experiments, we have verified the functionality and performance of BDAP. When the pressure test reaches 100 concurrent user volume, BDAP's average response time is 1.441 s, showing a high ability to process transactions. However, now just a few open-minded banks are willing to access BDAP, it might take a long time to change the traditional perception of the participants in supply chain finance.	blockchain;digital asset;threshold ecdsa algorithm;vbft consensus mechanism;digital signaturessupply chain finance
1565	实体经济	Uncovering dimensions of the impact of blockchain technology in supply chain management	Supply chains around the globe are faced with difficulties and disruptions due to the worldwide pandemic situation and digital solutions are needed. There is significant research interest in the implementation of blockchain technology (BCT) for supply chain management (SCM). A challenge that remains is analyzing the interactions of BCT in different areas of SCM. This study aims to identify the influential dimensions of the impact of BCT adoption in SCM and to discuss the synergetic and counter-synergetic effects between these dimensions. Advantages, disadvantages, and constraints of adopting BCT in the SCM context are explored through a systematic literature review, which provides the foundation for identifying the dimensions of impact. The interactions between these dimensions are conceptually discussed. This study introduces three dimensions of the impact of implementing BCT in SCM: 'operations and processes', 'supply chain relationships', and 'innovation and data access'. These dimensions are interrelated and have overlapping areas within them, which leads to synergetic and counter-synergetic effects. The overlaps and synergies of the three dimensions of impact are illustrated, and the virtuous and vicious cycles of BCT adoption in SCM cases are highlighted. This study assists scholars and practitioners by clarifying the synergetic relationships within the dimensions of the impact of BCT in SCM and by providing considerations to prevent undesirable effects and expand desired ones.	blockchain technology;supply chain management;dimensions of impact;advantages;disadvantages;constraintsimplementation;challenges;adoption;logistics;industry;traceability;operations;framework;benefits;system
1566	核心技术	Concentrated differentially private average consensus algorithm for a discrete-time network with heterogeneous dynamics	This paper presents a privacy-preserving average consensus algorithm for a discrete-time network with heterogeneous dynamic nodes in the presence of Gaussian privacy noises. Renyi divergence is used to measure the privacy, and a distributed algorithm is proposed for each node in the network to protect the initial output state and ensure consensus almost surely. The convergence rate of the proposed algorithm relates to the communication topology, dynamics of systems, and decaying rates of privacy noises. Moreover, by increasing neighbors of nodes in the network, the proposed algorithm can strengthen preservation. To demonstrate the theoretical results, a numerical example is carried out on a network of one hundred nodes. (C) 2022 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1567	技术治理	Ethereum Smart Contract Analysis Tools: A Systematic Review	Blockchain technology and its applications are gaining popularity day by day. It is a ground-breaking technology that allows users to communicate without the need of a trusted middleman. A smart contract (self-executable code) is deployed on the blockchain and auto executes due to a triggering condition. In a no-trust contracting environment, smart contracts can establish trust among parties. Terms and conditions embedded in smart contracts will be imposed immediately when specified criteria have been fulfilled. Due to this, the malicious assailants have a special interest in smart contracts. Blockchains are immutable means if some transaction is deployed or recorded on the blockchain, it becomes unalterable. Thus, smart contracts must be analyzed to ensure zero security vulnerabilities or flaws before deploying the same on the blockchain because a single vulnerability can lead to the loss of millions. For analyzing the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts, various analysis tools have been developed to create safe and secure smart contracts. This paper presents a systematic review on Ethereum smart contracts analysis tools. Initially, these tools are categorized into static and dynamic analysis tools. Thereafter, different sources code analysis techniques are studied such as taint analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing techniques. In total, 86 security analysis tools developed for Ethereum blockchain smart contract are analyzed regardless of tool type and analysis approach. Finally, the paper highlights some challenges and future recommendations in the field of Ethereum smart contracts.	ethereum;smart contract;blockchain;cryptocurrency;decentralized;dapp;vulnerabilities;security;analysis toolchallenges
1568	技术治理	Towards trusted node selection using blockchain for crowdsourced abnormal data detection	Node selection plays an important role to design and implement the crowdsourced abnormal data detection system with the purpose of completing complex tasks to meet the requirements of computing performance. Even though the blockchain-based trusted node selection approaches improve the reliability of the crowdsourcing task results, they still need to consider the crowdsourcing cost during the node selection process so as to embody a tradeoff between reliability and cost. In this paper, we propose to study the node selection problem for the crowdsourced abnormal data detection under both reliability and cost requirements. First, the working node selection is modeled as an inverse 0 - 1 knapsack problem in order to minimize the crowdsourcing cost under the budget constraints of the trustworthiness of the selected working nodes, where blockchain is used to calculate the trustworthiness of the working nodes. Then, a trusted working node selection (TWNS) algorithm is developed to select trusted working nodes with the minimum crowdsourcing cost for crowdsourced abnormal data detection, where the branch and bound method is utilized to efficiently solve the inverse 0 - 1 knapsack problem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted based on three groups of real world datasets. The results show that the trust value evaluation is accurate by using blockchain and the TWNS algorithm can ensure the reliability of the detection result. The crowdsourcing cost is minimized in trusted working node selection process. Compared to existing approaches without considering the cost, the TWNS algorithm reduces the crowdsourcing cost by 64.6%. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

1569	实体经济	Electronic Healthcare Data Record Security Using Blockchain and Smart Contract	An electronic health record (EHR) is a technology that allows you to keep track of your health information. It keeps computerized records of several healthcare organizations. Records are exchanged via enterprise-wide data systems as well as other networking technologies and exchanges. Patients nowadays expect immediate access to their health information. However, the health sector comes with immediate access to data, and there are worries about the privacy and security of medical records of patients. As a result, a blockchain-based solution can assist in resolving this issue. The blockchain has the potential to beat the conventional centralized system, which suffers from a severe lack of accessibility. This is a decentralized technology that has recently been presented to provide a new viewpoint on data security and system efficiency. This paper presents a blockchain-based system that helps the patient's data be managed and secured into a single record held by the patient. This system was developed using the Ethereum network using Ganache, as well as programming languages, tools, and techniques such as Solidity and web3.js. The measured approach suggested in this paper uses this platform to store patients' data and execute functions in a decentralized system using blockchain smart contracts. Transactions are communicated through the smart contract once it has been launched, providing security and privacy features. Furthermore, the transaction's desired alterations can be verified and transmitted to the entire distributed network. There is also a cryptocurrency wallet (MetaMask) that holds a centrally controlled, private information system in which records can be quickly accessed and secured by authorities. Doctors and patients can access the system through the wallet. Moreover, all the data of the doctor and patient will be secured and managed through this system. This proposed system is aimed at doing things such as the following: blockchain technology allows users to obtain the same data at the same time, increasing efficiency, developing credibility, and reducing barriers. It enables the secure storage of data by setting specific access for users. Additionally, this proposed system facilitates the secure transfer of patient medical records. Finally, this paper describes a health-record system and a new protocol that are quick and secure to use. It allows greater openness and ownership of sensitive data to be recorded and secured and also promotes the healthcare sector with blockchain.

By implementing the proposed BIoT temperature control system, it could securely transfer about 30,000 personal data for TSV prediction at the same time using a single PC. Moreover, the personalized TSV prediction model could improve accuracy compared to the existing generalized TSV prediction model. As a result, the developed BIoT temperature control system could improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency compared to manual indoor temperature control. Occupants can ultimately be satisfied with the personalized temperature control in every room where required IoT devices are installed without privacy issues.	blockchain;smart building technologies;building management system;intelligent control system;building automation system;iot sensor network;personalized control;energy efficiencythermal comfort;energy;buildings;health;technologies;environments;internet
1572	协同技术	An efficient multilevel security architecture for blockchain-based IoT networks using principles of cellular automata	The tremendous increase in the use of Internet of Things (IoT) has made an impact worldwide by changing the mode of day-to-day life. Like any other application, IoT based networks also have to be protected since the data produced consist of sensitive information. Existing algorithms for providing security in such networks do not consider all the security objectives. Starting from the sensing of data from IoT environment, the data have to be protected from several types of attacks. Also, the authentication of involved entities, integrity of data, access control and confidentiality are to be achieved. This work proposes a novel security architecture for IoT based distributed applications. The architecture uses the best known lightweight cipher ChaCha20. Principles of cellular automata are applied for random number generation to attain more security and randomness. Double encryption ensures multilevel protection of data during the data uploading and storing phases. Providing encryption based on dynamic session keys guarantees the security of the method. It also ensures secure data sharing, mutual authentication between communicating entities, fast execution, user authentication and message integrity. The IoT device connected to a gateway node has to complete registration phase successfully. Subsequently, each time a data transfer between the device and gateway node takes place, mutual authentication phase is executed. Blockchain network used at the edge level ensures authentication of participating nodes and hence, unintended modification of data is prevented. The proposed architecture proves to be efficient in terms of throughput, execution time and resistance to various security attacks.	iot security;chacha20 cipher;blockchain for iot security;cellular automata based random number generation;dynamic group key generationwireless sensor networks;key agreement scheme;user authentication;internet;things;protocol

The proposed method makes use of blockchain technology to secure the data exchange among the agents in the smart grid and avoid unauthorised access to the real data of the system. Considering the flexibility which is provided by the optimal switching in the smart grid, the reconfiguration problem is also considered in the model using some remote control switches. A stochastic framework based on the unscented transform is proposed to not only capture the independent randomness of the renewables but also to handle the correlated uncertainties among them. The problem formulation is constructed as a multi-objective optimization problem optimizing the total operating cost and the reliability indices. Due to the nonlinear and complex nature of the problem, a new optimization method based on the honey bee mating (HBM) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem without any simplification or linearization. Moreover, a correction approach based on local search is proposed to increase the algorithm capability. The appropriate performance of the proposed model is examined on a test smart grid. The data for the optimal decision is based on the internet of things (IoT) data.	blockchain;renewable sources;smart grid;correlated uncertainty;reconfigurationcommunication;microgrids
1574	协同技术	A Fault-Tolerant and Secure Architecture for Key Management in LoRaWAN Based on Permissioned Blockchain	Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) is a new type of wireless technology that offers long range communication for devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) and LoRaWAN is one of the main technologies currently available to enable LPWAN environments. In the LoRaWAN architecture, the Join Server is a key component and is responsible for security tasks, such as authentication and key management. However, the Join Server acts as a Single Point of Failure (SPOF) since all encryption keys are stored centrally. Then, this paper presents a secure and fault-tolerant architecture to increase the levels of security and availability in LoRaWAN. A permissioned blockchain and smart contracts are used to replace the Join Server and solve the SPOF problem. A working prototype was created using open-source tools in order to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed architecture. Additionally, the performance of a blockchain network was analyzed in a cloud environment under multiple workloads and fault-tolerance experiments were performed to evaluate the impact of network failures. The results show a trade-off between availability and performance when choosing the number of blockchain peers in small scenarios. However, this behavior is reversed in large scenarios where the performance of multiple peers is best suited.	blockchains;low-power wide area networks;servers;security;internet of things;logic gates;authentication;blockchain;hyperledger;internet of things;iot;lorawan;lpwan;security
1575	协同技术	Securing Environmental IoT Data Using Masked Authentication Messaging Protocol in a DAG-Based Blockchain: IOTA Tangle	The demand for the digital monitoring of environmental ecosystems is high and growing rapidly as a means of protecting the public and managing the environment. However, before data, algorithms, and models can be mobilized at scale, there are considerable concerns associated with privacy and security that can negatively affect the adoption of technology within this domain. In this paper, we propose the advancement of electronic environmental monitoring through the capability provided by the blockchain. The blockchain's use of a distributed ledger as its underlying infrastructure is an attractive approach to counter these privacy and security issues, although its performance and ability to manage sensor data must be assessed. We focus on a new distributed ledger technology for the IoT, called IOTA, that is based on a directed acyclic graph. IOTA overcomes the current limitations of the blockchain and offers a data communication protocol called masked authenticated messaging for secure data sharing among Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We show how the application layer employing the data communication protocol, MAM, can support the secure transmission, storage, and retrieval of encrypted environmental sensor data by using an immutable distributed ledger such as that shown in IOTA. Finally, we evaluate, compare, and analyze the performance of the MAM protocol against a non-protocol approach.	iot;security;privacy;environment;iota;tangle;mam;directed acyclic graph;blockchain;distributed ledgerperformance;challenges;signatures;internet

This paper innovatively takes the maximization of user benefit as the key point to predict transaction bidding price combining dynamic game theory. The bidding price of user transaction not only refers to historical transactions, but also considers the impact on future subsequences, and the result describes the interaction between transactions in detail. Also this paper proposes a method to express user satisfaction and establishes a user benefit model accordingly, so as to ensure the transaction is packaged successfully to the greatest extent within the acceptable range of transaction pricing. Finally this paper compares the proposed model with conventional machine learning prediction algorithms, finding that when user does not participate in the trading for the first time, the prediction effect of this proposal is better than that of machine learning over small data sets, moreover superior to machine learning methods in prediction accuracy and sensitivity, with a lower time complexity.	bitcoin;prediction algorithm;transaction fee;multi-player dynamic gameblockchain;technology
1577	市场治理	The dynamics of returns predictability in cryptocurrency markets	In this paper, we take a forecasting perspective and compare the information content of a set of market risk factors, cryptocurrency-specific predictors, and sentiment variables for the returns of cryptocurrencies vs traditional asset classes. To this aim, we rely on a flexible dynamic econometric model that not only features time-varying coefficients, but also allows for the entire forecasting model to change over time to capture the time variation in the exposures of major digital currencies to the predictive variables. Besides, we investigate whether the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in an already diversified portfolio leads to additional economic gains. The main empirical results suggest that cryptocurrencies are not systematically predicted by stock market factors, precious metal commodities or supply factors. On the contrary, they display a time-varying but significant exposure to investors' attention. In addition, also because of a lack of predictability compared to traditional asset classes, cryptocurrencies lead to realized expected utility gains for a power utility investor.	bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;returns predictability;investments;dynamic model averagingpredictive regressions;asset allocation;long-run;bitcoin;models;dependence;forecasts;gold

1579	实体经济	ProvNet: Networked bi-directional blockchain for data sharing with verifiable provenance	Data sharing is increasingly popular especially for scientific research and business fields where large volume of datasets need to be used, but it involves data security and privacy concerns. This paper mitigates such concerns by tracking and logging the history of shared data (i.e., provenance records) while preserving data privacy. This is a challenging problem in the data sharing scenario in this paper because the environment is decentralized and internal logs are not accessible publicly due to privacy concerns. We present ProvNet, a decentralized data sharing platform that can detect malicious users and provide secure provenance records using the newly proposed networked blockchain without disclosing raw data contents. Valid sharing records are collected and stored in the blocknet and misbehavior is detected with the stored provenance records according to our accountable protocols. We give a proof-ofconcept implementation, and evaluation results show that the overhead is acceptable. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

1581	市场治理	Research on Multidimensional Trust Evaluation Mechanism of FinTech Based on Blockchain	New technologies such as Internet, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have greatly promoted the innovation of financial industry structure and paradigm, improved the efficiency of financial services and brought the spillover of the financial technology (FinTech) risk. The existing financial regulation methods cannot meet the needs of the development of FinTech, therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the trust mechanism. Blockchain can effectively solve the problems of security and trust in FinTech. This paper will explore the expression method of trust index in blockchain, and build based on blockchain a multi-dimensional trust index system and evaluation mechanism (MDTEM) for FinTech. Firstly, a four-level blockchain structure has been built, including cloud level blockchain, Internet level blockchain, contract level blockchain and application level blockchain in the FinTech ecological environment to ensure the security, reliability and trustworthiness of financial services. Secondly, according to the trust structure of blockchain on FinTech payment behavior, the index system and evaluation mechanism of direct trust, indirect trust, recommendation trust and feedback trust of FinTech based on blockchain are designed. Finally, the trust simulation experiment of FinTech mechanism is carried out from three aspects: data sending, data transmission, data reception and delivery success rate. Simulation results show that the proposed MDTEM trust mechanism can better improve the safe and reliable application of FinTech trust mechanism.	blockchains;security;internet;smart contracts;indexes;business;peer-to-peer computing;fintech;blockchain;multidimensional trust;trust mechanismproof-of-work;management;internet;technology;challenges
1582	虚拟经济	The Effects of Central Bank Digital Currencies News on Financial Markets	Based on coverage of over 660m news stories from LexisNexis News & Business between 2015-2021, we provide two new indices around the growing area of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC): the CBDC Uncertainty Index (CBDCUI) and CBDC Attention Index (CBDCAI). We show that both indices spiked during news related to new developments in CBDC and in relation to digital currency news items. We demonstrate that CBDC indices have a significant negative relationship with the volatilities of the MSCI World Banks Index, USEPU, and the FTSE AllWorld Index, and positive with the volatilities of cryptocurrency markets, foreign exchange markets, bond markets, VIX, and gold. Our results suggest that financial markets are more sensitive to CBDC Uncertainty than CBDC Attention as proxy by these indices. These findings contain useful insights to individual and institutional investors, and can guide policymakers, regulators, and the media on how CBDC evolved as a barometer in the new digital-currency era.	cbdc;uncertainty and attention index;market effect;svar;dcc-gjr-garchsafe haven;gold;uncertainty;bitcoin;policy;hedge;cryptocurrencies;inflation;predict;stocks
1583	核心技术	An Anonymous Verifiable Random Function with Applications in Blockchain	Verifiable random function is a powerful function that provides a noninteractively public verifiable proof for its output. Recently, verifiable random function has found essential applications in designing secure consensus protocols in blockchain. How to construct secure and practical verifiable random functions has also attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a practical anonymous verifiable random function. Security proofs show that the proposed anonymous verifiable random function achieves correctness, anonymity, uniqueness, and pseudorandomness. In addition, we show a concrete application of our proposed anonymous verifiable random function in blockchain to improve the consensus mechanism for Hyperledger fabric. Finally, we implement the proposed anonymous verifiable random function and evaluate its performance. Test results show that the proposed anonymous verifiable random function supports faster computing operations and has a smaller proof size.	
1584	核心技术	A Metaheuristic Approach for Encrypting Blockchain Data Attributes Using Ciphertext Policy Technique	Unlike public chains, the Alliance Blockchain Hyperledger Fabric has a member management service mechanism that may provide data isolation security at the channel level. However, because this data isolation security technique synchronizes plaintext data inside the channel, data leakage is still a possibility. Furthermore, in some fine-grained privacy protection circumstances, channel-based data access restriction is ineffective. In order to solve the data privacy security problems in the above-mentioned consortium chain superledger, a blockchain data attribute encryption scheme based on ciphertext policy is proposed. Combining the original Fabric Certificate Authority module in the Hyperledger, the proposed scheme can realize the user-level fine-grained security access to control blockchain data while also realizing the secure distribution of user attribute keys in the blockchain data attribute encryption scheme based on the ciphertext policy scheme. The security analysis of the scheme shows that the scheme achieves the security goals of attribute-based encryption user attribute private key secure distribution and data privacy protection. The scope of this research is that this study confirms that the solution's architecture achieves fine-grained access control of private data on the Hyperledger Blockchain network and also the security objectives of secure transmission of user characteristic secret keys and data privacy protection. The performance analysis part also shows that the proposed scheme has good usability.	
1585	核心技术	Survey of Consensus Algorithms for Proof of Stake in Blockchain	As the core of blockchain technology, the consensus algorithm directly affects the security, stability, and decentralisation of the blockchain and numerous other important characteristics. Choosing an appropriate consensus algorithm for different scenarios is currently a challenge in the implementation of blockchain applications. This paper classifies the improvement schemes of proof of stake (PoS) into three categories: PoS-based consensus algorithms, PoS- and PoW-based consensus algorithms, and PoS- and BFT-based consensus algorithms. First, the study introduces the PoS and PoS consensus algorithm variants and then summarises the core ideas, effects, advantages, and disadvantages of these algorithms. Subsequently, the performances of the improved algorithms are compared. Finally, the main improved methods are summarised, and the most common network security attacks are discussed. The study lays a foundation for the main improvement directions of PoS in the future, hoping to provide a reference for researchers to help them select and design consensus algorithms in different application scenarios while also helping the evolution of consensus algorithms and the implementation of blockchain applications.	security;internet
1586	实体经济	Learnings from COVID-19 for managing humanitarian supply chains: systematic literature review and future research directions	The COVID-19 pandemic has been experienced as the most significant global disaster after the Spanish flue in 1918. Millions of people lost their life due to a lack of preparedness and ineffective strategies for managing humanitarian supply chains (HSC). Based on the learnings from this pandemic outbreak, different strategies for managing the effective HSC have been explored in the present context of pandemics through a systematic literature review. The findings highlight some of the major challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as lack of planning and preparedness, extended shortages of essential lifesaving items, inadequate lab capacity, lack of transparency and visibility, inefficient distribution network, high response time, dependencies on single sourcing for the medical equipment and medicines, lack of the right information on time, and lack of awareness about the protocol for the treatment of the viral disease. Some of the significant learnings observed from this analysis are the use of multiple sourcing of essential items, joint procurement, improving collaboration among all stakeholders, applications of IoT and blockchain technologies for improving tracking and traceability of essential commodities, application of data analytics tools for accurate prediction of next possible COVID wave/disruptions and optimization of distribution network. Limited studies are focused on finding solutions to these problems in managing HSC. Therefore, as a future scope, researchers could find solutions to optimizing the distribution network in context to pandemics, improving tracing and tracking of items during sudden demand, improving trust and collaborations among different agencies involved in HSC.	covid-19;humanitarian supply chains;poverty and food security;swift trust;prepositioning;coordination;collaboration;systematic literature reviewswift trust;big data;logistics;relief;management;coordination;model;food;transportation;cooperation
1587	核心技术	Applications of Auction and Mechanism Design in Edge Computing: A Survey	Edge computing as a promising technology provides lower latency, more efficient transmission, and faster speed of data processing since the edge servers are closer to the user devices. Each edge server with limited resources can offload latency-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks from nearby user devices. However, edge computing faces challenges such as resource allocation, energy consumption, security and privacy issues, etc. Auction mechanisms can well characterize bidirectional interactions between edge servers and user devices under the above constraints in edge computing. As demonstrated by the existing works, auction and mechanism design approaches are outstanding on achieving optimal allocation strategy while guaranteeing mutual satisfaction among edge servers and user devices, especially for scenarios with scarce resources. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive survey of recent researches that apply auction approaches in edge computing. Firstly, a brief overview of edge computing including three common edge computing paradigms, i.e., cloudlet, fog computing and mobile edge computing, is presented. Then, we introduce fundamentals and backgrounds of auction schemes commonly used in edge computing systems. After then, a comprehensive survey of applications of auction-based approaches applied for edge computing is provided, which is categorized by different auction approaches. Finally, several open challenges and promising research directions are discussed.	auction;edge computing;cloudlet;fog computing;mobile edge computing;resource allocation;computing offloading;incentive;iot;blockchaintruthful double auction;resource-allocation;bandwidth allocation;blockchain;internet;optimization;energy;assignment;game;algorithms
1588	核心技术	Blockchain-Based Edge Computing Data Storage Protocol Under Simplified Group Signature	In contrast to the traditional cloud-based IoT structure, which imposes high computation and storage demands on the central cloud server, edge computing can process data at the network edge. In this article, we present an edge computing data storage protocol employing the blockchain and the group signature, where the blockchain works as the trusted third party, offering a convenient platform for the data storage and protection, and the group signature is utilized for privacy identity information protection. Unlike the common group signature scheme, we propose a notion of simplified group signature, which removes the traceable property to improve the computational efficiency. In edge computing, the edge devices and the end devices can easily set up a long-term trust relationship through the cloud services, so the traceability may be of little utility in this scenario. In our protocol, we also design a new data validation scheme that has a proof size of only O(1).	simplified group signature;blockchain;data storage;privacy protection;edge computingauthentication scheme;iot applications;internet
1589	实体经济	Multi-Party Certification on Blockchain and Its Impact in the Market for Lemons	Markets in which similar goods of different qualities are sold suffer from information asymmetries and their negative consequences. Dealers have established themselves, and mediate these markets through their use of quality signals. While these signals help to mitigate information asymmetries, these markets still function well below their optimum: a large share of goods sold are overpriced, and most of the benefits are reaped by intermediaries. In this paper we build on prior research that proposes the use of blockchain as an enabler for trusted, decentralized asset documentation. Applying a socio-technical lens, we describe how blockchain-enabled multi-party certification affords dealers the action potential to send signals that are more closely correlated to the unobservable quality of the underlying good (i.e., signals with a higher fit) than the signals they send today. We then both theorize and experimentally explore the market effects of the two types of signals. Using data from a laboratory market experiment with 210 participants, we find empirical evidence that multi-party certification affords dealers the action potential to send signals of significantly higher fit than those sent by intermediaries alone, leading to a reduction in information asymmetries, a more efficient allocation of goods, and an increase in market fairness.	blockchain;quality certification;information asymmetry;market for lemons;online signaling;multi-party certification;market mechanisminformation;systems;technology;trust;prices
1590	协同技术	A Proxy Signature-Based Swarm Drone Authentication With Leader Selection in 5G Networks	Drones are imperative for the 5G architecture as a mobile source to expand network coverage and support seamless services, particularly through enabling device-to-device (D2D) communication. Such deployment of drones in D2D settings raises various security threats in drone communication. While the existing D2D communication security standard within the 4G cellular architecture may address some of these issues, the standard includes heavy traffic toward the network core servers. If this security standard is to be adopted in the 5G D2D security services with the same traffic load, it may negatively impact the 5G network performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight proxy signature-based authentication mechanism for a swarm of drones compatible with the 5G D2D standard mechanisms. This paper proposes a distributed delegation-based authentication mechanism to reduce the traffic overhead toward the 5G core network. In this scheme, the legitimate drones are authorized as proxy delegated signers to perform authentication on behalf of the core network. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism to elect and relocate a new leader relay drone from the existing drone swarm. We implemented the proposed authentication algorithm in the 5G D2D-based communication package over NS-3 while performing the computational calculations on a RaspberryPi3 device to mimic the drone calculation process and delays. The performance of the proposed authentication shows a promising reduction in the authentication time and shows lightweight and reliable compatibility.	drones;authentication;device-to-device communication;5g mobile communication;security;standards;protocols;5g security;authentication;d2d;drones;delegation;proxy signaturecommunication;scheme;internet;blockchain;protocol
1591	核心技术	Cooperative energy dispatch of smart building cluster based on smart contracts br	The problem of efficient energy consumption in buildings is becoming increasingly prominent with the rapid development of the global economy. The application of distributed energy introduces new solutions for energy conservation in buildings. Hence, residents can use and store clean energy to reduce the amount of electricity they buy from the grid, thereby reducing energy consumption. However, the traditional centralised aggregator approach has many disadvantages, including malicious node attacks, difficult dispatching, high transmission consumption and high operation cost. The day-ahead smart contract has been innovatively designed in this paper to enable the collaborative decision of participants on the day-ahead dispatch plan and subsequently ensure the forecast monitoring during the next day. In addition, the intraday smart contract can autonomously realise multilateral transactions based on reputation value and billing autonomously. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach can reduce the cost of distributed energy dispatching.	blockchain;distributed energy;economic dispatch;multilateral transactions;smart building cluster;smart contractsoptimization;consumption
1592	实体经济	Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Technology in Healthcare and Agriculture	Over the last decade, the healthcare sector has accelerated its digitization and electronic health records (EHRs). As information technology progresses, the notion of intelligent health also gathers popularity. By combining technologies such as the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI), innovative healthcare modifies and enhances traditional medical systems in terms of efficiency, service, and personalization. On the other side, intelligent healthcare systems are incredibly vulnerable to data breaches and other malicious assaults. Recently, blockchain technology has emerged as a potentially transformative option for enhancing data management, access control, and integrity inside healthcare systems. Integrating these advanced approaches in agriculture is critical for managing food supply chains, drug supply chains, quality maintenance, and intelligent prediction. This study reviews the literature, formulates a research topic, and analyzes the applicability of blockchain to the agriculture/food industry and healthcare, with a particular emphasis on AI and IoT. This article summarizes research on the newest blockchain solutions paired with AI technologies for strengthening and inventing new technological standards for the healthcare ecosystems and food industry.	records
1593	协同技术	Novel Searchable Attribute-Based Encryption for the Internet of Things	As the product of the third information technology revolution, the Internet of Things (IoT) has greatly altered our way of lifetime. Cloud storage has gradually become the best choice for data processing due to its scalability and flexibility. However, the cloud is not a completely trusted entity, such as tampering with user data or leaking personal privacy. Therefore, cloud storage usually adopts attribute-based encryption schemes to accomplish data confidentiality and fine-grained access control. However, applying the ABE scheme to the Internet of Things still faces many challenges, such as dynamic user revocation, data sharing, and excessive computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel searchable attribute encryption system that replaces the traditional key generation center with consortium blockchain to generate and manage partial keys. In addition, our scheme can perform predecryption operations in the cloud, and users only need to spend a small amount of computational cost to achieve decryption operations. Security analysis proves that our scheme achieves security under both the chosen keyword attack and the chosen plaintext attack. Compared with other schemes, this scheme is more economical in terms of computing and storage.	access-control;scheme;iot
1594	市场治理	Total and Net-Directional Connectedness of Cryptocurrencies During the Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Pandemic	This paper presents how volatility propagates through the cryptocurrency market. Our paper provides evidence for volatility connectedness on cryptocurrencies. The different econometric techniques, including the stochastic volatility (SVOL) model and time-varying parameter VAR models using a quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL), are applied to measure the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Using high-frequency, intra-day data of the largest cryptocurrencies over 2018-2021, we detect the great volatility of the cryptocurrency market are the beginning of 2019, the beginning of 2020, and throughout the year of 2021. The total connectedness values suggest that the cryptocurrency market becomes volatile as the new strains of the COVID-19 appear at the end of 2021. However, by using directional connectedness, we reveal that there are negative and positive spillovers from a specific cryptocurrency to other cryptocurrencies. The great fluctuations in the period before the COVID-19 health crisis stem from the positive resonance (symmetric) between the volatility of each cryptocurrency, while this health crisis leads to substantially positive and negative spillovers (asymmetric) of cryptocurrencies, and this makes market volatility weaker than it actually is.	cryptocurrency;covid-19 pandemic;volatility;connectedness;spilloverstochastic volatility models;bitcoin returns;likelihood approach;bayesian-analysis;price discovery;gold;predict;dollar;shocks
1595	法律治理	The new geography of asylum: digital identity, artificial intelligence and blockchain	For several years, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has insisted on the need to invest in new technologies to improve the procedures for the identification, reception and redistribution of asylum seekers around the world. United Nations experts have promoted new forms of digital inclusion aimed at both asylum seekers and displaced persons. They consider digital tools to be essential for achieving one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals: Target 16.9, which by 2030 intends to provide legal identity for all, including birth registration. Biometrics have been used on an experimental basis since the early 2000s to create digital identities in the humanitarian space for those vulnerable persons without traditional identity documents. It is a divisive subject. The aim of this article is to consider, from a geopolitical perspective, if following the acceleration of the digital revolution caused by the pandemic it is possible to invest in technological tools to improve the processes of identification, redistribution and reception of asylum seekers and displaced persons while at the same time respecting their privacy and freedoms. This hypothesis would signal the emergence of a geography of receiving asylum seekers on a global scale based not only on the governance of territory and borders, but also on platform governance.	asylum seeker;biometrics;digital identity;refugee;stateless
1596	实体经济	A motivational local trading framework with 2-round auctioning and settlement rules embedded in smart contracts for a small citizen energy community	We propose a motivational local trading framework with a 2-round auctioning system and a novel settlement approach to stimulate local transactions on the electricity surplus of a small community. Two auction price systems and several settlement mechanisms are formulated and compared to assess local trading profit and local market efficiency. We also implement a SC-based mechanism that embeds the auction results and rules to increase trust in the bidding and settlement processes. Our simulations use actual consumption and generation data from 11 houses with smart appliances and self-generation capabilities. We show that auctions, if used consistently, can help the development of a local trade by encouraging people to buy from their neighbors and invest in more generating facilities, knowing that there is a local market on which to rely. Compared to the hybrid -Pay-as-Bid (PaB) in the 1st round plus Uniform Price (UP) in the 2nd round -approach, the pure 2-round UP auction was shown to decrease trading with the retailer by 7.5%. The market indicators are quite similar for the two pricing methods, whereas the proposed settlement mechanism reduces the buyers' payments by 7% and increases sellers' encashments by around 8%.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Suitable platforms must be generated by the tourism industry, which are beneficial to users when their demands are satisfied based on financial, technology, knowledge, and industry matters. Intermediaries are applied to alleviate different problems that are related to the non-fulfilment of contracts of existing users and service providers who are offering their services and represent a reliable third party. However, it is significant that intermediaries must be reliable when charges are incurred for any possible commission. Cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to provide smoothness in money interchange without the need for reliable third parties. This interchange allows an increasing number of different new forms, which are related to different customer-to-customer transactions. The study attempts to provide an appropriate answer to the main research question, which is: 'Will the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies bring new types of customer-to-customer markets from a technological, organizational, and environmental perspective?'.	blockchain technology;business model;cryptocurrency;customer-to-customer;third party;monetary transactionchain management;business model;bitcoin;trust;challenges;entrepreneurship;technology;governance;innovation;framework
1598	虚拟经济	Study on Enterprise Financial Risk Prevention and Early Warning System Based on Blockchain Technology	To address the challenges of financing SMEs, breaking the limitations of traditional financing models, a blockchain-based financial risk prevention and early warning system for businesses has been proposed and an in-depth study of the system has been undertaken. As a scientific and technological means to strengthen the disclosure and sharing of information such as credit records and risk early warning, The key to getting financial institutions to lend to SMEs is to avoid financial credit risk in the value chain. Considering SMEs located in supply chains as an object of study, using the logical relationships between block chains and financial credit risk management chains, three principles of supply chain management are proposed by analyzing the logical relationships between supply chains and financial credit control chains. Chain using blockchain technology, namely. the principle of recognizing the trust of major enterprises, the principle of sharing information about the financing process and the principle of general cooperation for successful financing. Based on this principle, an evolutionary game model is used to analyze the evolutionary path of endorsement fiduciary relationships between major enterprises and SMEs, the influencers of evolutionary equilibrium, the evolutionary path of cooperation between commercial banks and SMEs in financing, the evolutionary path under the control of third-party institutions, and influencers. The research shows that the financing activities of commercial banks and small and medium-sized enterprises are based on the trust endorsement of core enterprises in the supply chain, and the intervention of third-party regulators will help to promote the consistent cooperation and information sharing of all participants in the supply chain, so as to promote the smooth completion of supply chain financing.

In this regard, Digital Twins (DTs) provide actionable insights through monitoring, simulating, predicting, and optimizing the state of CPSs. Through the use cases, including system testing and training, detecting system misconfigurations, and security testing, DTs strengthen the security of CPSs throughout the product lifecycle. However, such benefits of DTs depend on an assumption about data integrity and security. Data trustworthiness becomes more critical while integrating multiple components among different DTs owned by various stakeholders to provide an aggregated view of the complex physical system. This article envisions a blockchain-based DT framework as Trusted Twins for Securing Cyber-Physical Systems (TTS-CPS). With the automotive industry as a CPS use case, we demonstrate the viability of the TTS-CPS framework through a proof of concept. To utilize reliable system specification data for building the process knowledge of DTs, we ensure the trustworthiness of data-generating sources through Integrity Checking Mechanisms (ICMs). Additionally, Safety and Security (S&S) rules evaluated during simulation are stored and retrieved from the blockchain, thereby establishing more understanding and confidence in the decisions made by the underlying systems. Finally, we perform formal verification of the TTS-CPS. (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

1600	核心技术	DIMY: Enabling privacy-preserving contact tracing	The infection rate of COVID-19 and the rapid mutation ability of the virus has forced governments and health authorities to adopt lockdowns, increased testing, and contact tracing to reduce the virus's spread. Digital contact tracing has become a supplement to the traditional manual contact tracing process. However, although several digital contact tracing apps are proposed and deployed, these have not been widely adopted due to apprehensions surrounding privacy and security. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based privacy -preserving contact tracing protocol,"Did I Meet You" (DIMY). The protocol provides full-lifecycle data privacy protection on the devices as well as the back-end servers to address most of the privacy concerns associated with existing protocols. We have employed Bloom filters to provide efficient privacy-preserving storage and have used the Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secret sharing among the participants. We show that DIMY provides resilience against many well-known attacks while introducing negligible overheads. DIMY's footprint on the storage space of clients' devices and back-end servers is also significantly lower than other similar state-of-the-art apps.	covid-19;contact tracing;bloom filter;blockchain;privacy;security

1602	实体经济	A novel group BWM approach to evaluate the implementation criteria of blockchain technology in the automotive industry supply chain br	The use of blockchain technology leads to improved operations and supply chain (SC) integration. Moreover, identifying and evaluating the blockchain technology application criteria in the logistics system is a Multi- Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) challenge that requires taking into account the perspectives of experts with varying degrees of SC expertise. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel group decision-making method based on the best-worst method (BWM) to evaluate the criteria of implementing blockchain technology in the SC. The proposed approach provides a mechanism whereby opinions of decision-makers (DMs) are aggregated in nine steps, first. Then, weights of criteria are determined using BWM individual decision-making models. Moreover, two individual decision-making methods called nonlinear goal programming based BWM II (NGPBWM II) and linear goal programming based BWM II (LGPBWM II) are extended in this study, which can be adopted in both individual and group decision-making problems. The NGPBWM II and LGPBWM II methods can be used for both individual and group decision-making. This study proposes a novel group decision-making framework. The framework has fewer constraints than previous group BWM models and can consider different best (worst) criteria by different DMs. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is investigated employing eight numerical examples. The results reveal the high accuracy of the NGPBWM II in all eight ex-amples. Therefore, a combination of the proposed group decision-making method and NGPBWM II is applied in a real case to evaluate the application criteria of the blockchain technology in the automotive industry SC, which was a new application for using blockchain technology in SC.	blockchain mcdm;group decision-making;goal programming;best-worst methodgroup decision-making;best-worst method;quality assessment;circular economy;selection;model;challenges;integration;management;adoption
1603	实体经济	A Review and Classification Framework of Traceability Approaches for Identifying Product Supply Chain Counterfeiting	Counterfeiting is found today in many industries and in various forms with severe consequences for supply chain operations. Products counterfeiting can be detected in consumer goods such as clothing, food and beverages, accessories, pharmaceuticals, electronics, and luxury goods. The continuous violations in the supply chain have led to the need for mobilization of all involved stakeholders to overcome counterfeiting challenges. Effective traceability seems to be the only way to combat this phenomenon, ensuring safe and sustainable supply chain operations. This paper presents a structured literature review on traceability approaches for combatting the product supply chain counterfeiting phenomenon that led to forming a structured classification framework. The performed analysis aims to identify trends and good practices and can be used as a guideline for real-life projects against supply chain counterfeiting. The results show that traditional traceability methods are not effective as they can be easily falsified using today's technological advancements. However, these same advancements also present valuable technologies such as blockchain and the internet of things to ensure safe and sustainable supply chain operations.	traceability;supply chain;counterfeiting;technologies;blockchain;internet of things;industry sectors

1605	核心技术	ATOM: Architectural Support and Optimization Mechanism for Smart Contract Fast Update and Execution in Blockchain-Based IoT	Blockchain-based Internet of Things (BC-IoT) brings the advantages of blockchain into traditional IoT systems. In BC-IoT, the smart contract has been widely used for automatic, trusted, and decentralized applications. Smart contracts require frequent adjust and fast update due to various reasons, such as inevitable code bugs, changes of applications, or security requirements. However, previous smart contract architecture and updating mechanism are low speed and cause high overhead, because they are based on recompilation and redeployment in BC-IoT. Meanwhile, smart contract execution is so time consuming due to contract instruction dispatching and operand loading in the stack-based Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). To address these issues, we propose a new smart contract architecture and optimization mechanism for BC-IoTs, ATOM, which provides architectural supports to update contract economically and fast executing in instructionwise for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. We design a compact Application-oriented Instruction (AoI) set to describe application operations. We can construct the bytecode of smart contract from application by directly assembling templates prebuilt upon the AoIs rather than by compilation. We also present an optimized mechanism for AoI execution to enable access addressable storage place rather than the indirect access through stack. We perform ATOM on a BC-IoT testbed based on private Ethereum and Hyperledger Burrow. The experimental results highlight that ATOM is more efficient than state-of-the-art approaches. ATOM can reduce update latency by 62.7%, ledger size by 70%, and gas usage by 90% on average, respectively. Compared with the traditional smart contract architecture, ATOM can improve EVM Memory access efficiency significantly by up to 10x and achieve improvement of execution efficiency with up to 1.6 x.	ethereum virtual machine (evm);smart contractinternet;framework;scheme;things

This article describes our type-based static verification tool Helmholtz for Michelson, which is a statically typed stack-based language for writing smart contracts that are executed on the blockchain platform Tezos. Helmholtz is designed on top of our extension of Michelson's type system with refinement types. Helmholtz takes a Michelson program annotated with a user-defined specification written in the form of a refinement type as input; it then typechecks the program against the specification based on the refinement type system, discharging the generated verification conditions with the SMT solver Z3. We briefly introduce our refinement type system for the core calculus Mini-Michelson of Michelson, which incorporates the characteristic features such as compound datatypes (e.g., lists and pairs), higher-order functions, and invocation of another contract. Helmholtz successfully verifies several practical Michelson programs, including one that transfers money to an account and that checks a digital signature.	smart contract;blockchain;formal verification;tools
1607	核心技术	Trusted Resource Allocation Based on Smart Contracts for Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Things	By sharing resources between edge servers and end users, edge-end cooperation is one important way to support various applications in Internet of Things, which have critical resource requirements on computing, storage, or bandwidth. How to price these resources and how to evaluate the service quality of edge servers are two key issues to support trusted resource allocation for blockchain-enabled Internet of Things. In this article, we provide a trusted resource allocation mechanism based on smart contracts, in which a group-buying pricing mechanism (GBPM) and a reputation evaluation mechanism (REM) are proposed to effectively address the problems existing in resources pricing and service quality evaluation of edge servers. In the trusted resource allocation mechanism, end users can choose a purchase mode from four pricing schemes in terms of actual demands on delay and price, and smart contracts can match end users with high-reputation edge servers automatically. Moreover, end users can submit reputation evaluations to smart contracts based on the behaviors of edge servers. Simulation results show the GBPM can provide differentiated prices and optimize the utility of end users accordingly, while the REM is more sensitive to edge servers with irregular behaviors and quickly reduces their reputations so that the success rate of transactions is improved.	servers;resource management;internet of things;pricing;blockchains;smart contracts;security;blockchain;group-buying pricing;internet of things;reputation evaluation;resource allocation;smart contractsauction mechanism;reputation;privacy;systems;scheme
1608	实体经济	Data Integrity Audit Scheme Based on Blockchain Expansion Technology	Increasing numbers of users are outsourcing data to the cloud, but data integrity is an important issue. Due to the decentralization and immutability of blockchain, more and more researchers tend to use blockchain to replace third-party auditors. This paper proposes a data integrity system based on blockchain expansion technology that aims to solve the problem of high cost for blockchain network maintenance and for user creation of new blocks caused by the rapid growth of blocks in the data integrity audit scheme of existing blockchain technology. Users and cloud service providers (CSP) deploy smart contracts on the main chain and sub-chains. Intensive and frequent computing work is transferred to the sub-chain for completion, and the computation results of the sub-chain are submitted to the main chain periodically or when needed to ensure its finality. The concept of non-interactive audit is introduced to avoid affecting user experience due to the communication with the CSP during the audit process. In order to ensure data security, a reward pool mechanism is introduced. Comprehensive analysis from aspects such as storage, batch auditing and data consistency proves the correctness of the scheme. Experiments on the Ethereum blockchain platform demonstrate that this scheme can effectively reduce storage and computational overhead.	blockchains;cloud computing;data integrity;plasmas;smart contracts;costs;servers;blockchain;cloud storage;data auditing;blockchain expansion

However, the Ransomware techniques utilize certain device which may lead to undesirable properties which might shrink the paying-victim pool. This paper devises a new method, namely Water Moth Flame optimization (WMFO) and deep recurrent neural network (Deep RNN) for determining Ransomware. Here, Deep RNN training is done with WMFO, and is developed by combining Moth Flame optimization (MFO) and Water wave optimization (WWO). Moreover, features are mined with opcodes and by finding term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) amongst individual features. Moreover, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is adapted to choose significant features. These features are adapted in Deep RNN for classification, wherein the proposed WMFO is employed to produce optimum weights. The WMFO offered enhanced performance with elevated accuracy of 95.025%, sensitivity of 95%, and specificity of 96%.	blockchain;deep rnn;n-gram features;probabilistic principal component analysis;ransomwaredesign
1612	协同技术	Implementation of a Secure LoRaWAN System for Industrial Internet of Things Integrated With IPFS and Blockchain	Low-power, low-cost, and long-range connectivity for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks are the key stipulations, nowadays. However, implementing a cost-effective, flexible, and feasible system considering server and networking security is still an open challenge. In this article, a complete end-to-end long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) system has been demonstrated by implementing blockchain-based secure distributed data management, which is applicable in various secure IIoT applications. Dynamic data collected by multiple LoRa sensors are encrypted in a LoRa server, and the encrypted content is automatically stored in the InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. To achieve data consistency, the content IDs collected from the IPFS are stored in the quorum blockchain with consortium setup using a smart contract. The consortium network is maintained by the Raft consensus algorithm employing seven nodes. The design architecture of the hardware used for both LoRa transmitting node and gateway has been described in comprehensive manners. The performance of the LoRaWAN system is analyzed by the received signal strength indicator, the communications range, and packet loss rate metrics in both line-of-sight and nonline-of-sight test systems. The data management scheme is implemented in Python, and the performance is evaluated in terms of transaction time and block size.	encoding;bandwidth;industrial internet of things;blockchains;logic gates;servers;cryptography;blockchain;industrial internet of things (iiot);long range;long-range wide area network (lorawan);securityperformance;network
1613	协同技术	EntrapNet: A Blockchain-Based Verification Protocol for Trustless Computing	In this article, we propose a blockchain-based computing verification protocol, called EntrapNet, for distributed shared computing networks, an emerging underlying network for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. EntrapNet borrows the idea from the practice of entrapment in criminal law to reduce the possibility of receiving incorrect computing results from trustless service providers who have offered the computing resources. Furthermore, we mathematically optimize EntrapNet to deal with the fundamental tradeoff of a network: security and efficiency. We present an asymptotic optimal solution to this optimization. It will be seen that EntrapNet can be performed as an independent and low-cost layer atop of any trustless network that requires outsourced computing, thus making secure computing affordable and practical.	task analysis;blockchains;smart contracts;phishing;protocols;internet of things;systems architecture;blockchain;computing;distributed;incentive;verification
1614	协同技术	Hash Access in Blockchain Radio Access Networks: Characterization and Optimization	Blockchain radio access network (B-RAN) is a decentralized, trustworthy wireless networking paradigm spurred by distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In B-RAN, even though the blockchain builds trust in upper layers, the absence of trust between client devices still causes the problem with open access, or the so-called Rogue's dilemma, and degrades the network performance. Therefore, Hash Access was proposed for B-RAN to address the trust issue between clients and enforce client devices to obey the grant-free access rule. However, the characteristics and performance of Hash Access in B-RAN remain unclear. In this work, we dive deep into the Rogue's dilemma from a game-theoretic model to emphasize the necessity of Hash Access. We establish an analytical model to comprehensively evaluate the performance of B-RAN using Hash Access regarding transmission success probability, access delay, and network throughput. Based on the analytical model, we further optimize the Hash Access protocol for network throughput and provide useful practical guidelines. Simulation results are presented to validate our proposed model and insights.	analytical models;performance evaluation;games;internet of things;delays;blockchains;costs;blockchain;internet of things (iot);machine-to-machine communications;medium access control protocol;radio access network (ran)internet;performance;management;lte
1615	实体经济	BSD-Guard: A Collaborative Blockchain-Based Approach for Detection and Mitigation of SDN-Targeted DDoS Attacks	Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enhances the flexibility and programmability of networks by separating control plane and data plane. The logically centralized control mechanism makes the control plane vulnerable in both single and multiple controller scenarios. Malicious third parties can exploit vulnerabilities of reactive forwarding mode to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against SDN controllers. Unfortunately, existing DoS/DDoS solutions under single controller can not afford effective performance under multiple controllers due to the absence of cooperative detection and mitigation. To solve the above problem, we propose a blockchain-based SDN-targeted DDoS defense framework (BSD-Guard) that can provide cooperative detection and mitigation mechanism to protect SDN controllers. BSD-Guard introduces a blockchain-based secure middle plane between control plane and data plane. The secure middle plane calculates the suspect rate of new flows based on the collected packets' information and reports suspect lists to blockchain for immutably storing and sharing. Besides, the smart contract deployed on blockchain in advance constitutes collaborative defense strategies based on the suspect lists reported from multiple SDN domains. When receiving defense strategies, the secure middle plane converts them to specific flow table actions and installs actions into relevant switches. The experimental results indicate that BSD-Guard can efficiently detect DoS/DDoS attacks in multiple controllers scenario and issue precise defensive strategies near the source of attack by identifying the attack path.	software;dos
1616	市场治理	Digital currencies, monetary sovereignty, and U.S.-China power competition	The rise of digital currencies challenges practices of monetary sovereignty and impacts the international monetary order. Drawing on recent IPE debates about the public-private nature of money, the critique of the "impossible trinity" and "territorial currencies," this article explores the competition between China and the United States over and within the international monetary system. The two largest economies display strikingly divergent regulatory approaches to cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). China completely banned cryptocurrencies but became a front-runner in developing a CBDC. It aims to expand the RMB's global role without giving up its monetary control. U.S. administrations have instead reluctantly considered regulating cryptocurrencies. Discussions on a potential digital U.S. dollar (USD) only began in 2020. Washington aims at preserving the existing cross-border financial mechanisms and offshore infrastructure for USD-denominated transactions and credit creation. It focuses on financial crime and maintaining the innovation dynamic of its private sector to preserve its "exorbitant privilege." Emerging financial infrastructures and standards for digital currencies are the new technological arena for U.S.-China monetary competition.	central bank digital currency;cryptocurrency;digital currency;monetary sovereignty;rmb;u.s.-china power competition;u.s. dollarstructural power;global finance;internationalization;state;cryptocurrencies;politics;policy;money;order
1617	市场治理	A Deep Learning-Based Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Model That Uses On-Chain Data	Cryptocurrency has recently attracted substantial interest from investors due to its underlying philosophy of decentralization and transparency. Considering cryptocurrency's volatility and unique characteristics, accurate price prediction is essential for developing successful investment strategies. To this end, the authors of this work propose a novel framework that predicts the price of Bitcoin (BTC), a dominant cryptocurrency. For stable prediction performance in unseen price range, the change point detection technique is employed. In particular, it is used to segment time-series data so that normalization can be separately conducted based on segmentation. In addition, on-chain data, the unique records listed on the blockchain that are inherent in cryptocurrencies, are collected and utilized as input variables to predict prices. Furthermore, this work proposes self-attention-based multiple long short-term memory (SAM-LSTM), which consists of multiple LSTM modules for on-chain variable groups and the attention mechanism, for the prediction model. Experiments with real-world BTC price data and various method setups have proven the proposed framework's effectiveness in BTC price prediction. The results are promising, with the highest MAE, RMSE, MSE, and MAPE values of 0.3462, 0.5035, 0.2536, and 1.3251, respectively.	cryptocurrency;blockchains;predictive models;investment;bitcoin;gold;data models;blockchain;cryptocurrency;bitcoin;deep learning;prediction methods;change detection algorithms

However, such a process also raises two challenging but critical issues: 1) trustworthy and 2) privacy issue for data collectors. Therefore, this article proposes a novel system, which is designed over the distributed mobile-edge network to sufficiently exploit advantages of blockchain and differential privacy (DP) to collect trustworthy data and protect privacy for data collectors. First, to improve trustworthiness of data collections, a new consensus mechanism is proposed for blockchain-based data collection structure, which comprehensively incorporates trustworthy, collection contribution, and throughput together to prefer data collectors for the next block. Second, with the assistance of fully trusted devices, a verifiable trustworthy evaluation strategy is designed to accurately compute the trustworthiness for data collectors. Third, we enforce DP on the data stored in a global blockchain maintained by the cloud server to protect privacy for data collectors without influencing data availability. Finally, both theoretical analyses and experimental results prove that the proposed system comprehensively improves performance of data collections in distributed network without adding any additional cost for the cloud server, compared to other schemes.	data collection;blockchains;smart devices;servers;internet of things;cloud computing;differential privacy;blockchain;differential privacy (dp);distributed mobile-edge network (men);drones;trustinternet;smart;vehicles;things;model
1619	实体经济	A Blockchain Consensus Optimization-Based Algorithm for Food Traceability	At present, blockchain technology is more and more widely used in the field of food traceability, and good results have been achieved. However, many of the current blockchain technologies and algorithms are not developed for the specific situation of food traceability, resulting in resource waste and low computational efficiency. In view of these problems, this paper analyzes and summarizes the classic distributed consensus mechanism in blockchain technology, focusing on the PBFT (practical Byzantine fault tolerance) consensus mechanism and the existing problems related to the improvement scheme. In order to solve the problem of low efficiency of a consensus algorithm in a food traceability scenario, this paper proposes a blockchain consensus algorithm suitable for the food traceability scenario based on clustering and food credit. In addition, the differences between the improved algorithm and the classical Byzantine consensus algorithm in consensus algorithm time and communication times are analyzed through experiments and simulations. The consensus efficiency of the improved algorithm in this paper is significantly improved, which can greatly reduce the application difficulty of blockchain in food traceability.

Energy trading management for EVs is becoming a challenge. However, existing research has not considered the problem of information sharing between energy traders and issues surrounding the protection of user privacy. Therefore, in this article, we propose a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) electricity trading architecture based on blockchain. All energy transactions of EVs can be recorded on the blockchain ledger to ensure privacy and smart contracts work as agents for pricing and optimal energy allocation. Furthermore, we introduce a two-way auction mechanism based on the Bayesian game and design a new price adjustment strategy. Finally, we propose a bidirectional auction mechanism based on the Bayesian game approach. We use extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the social welfare and cost performance of our algorithm can be improved by up to 102.8% and 319%, respectively.	blockchain;vehicle-to-grid;games;pricing;bayes methods;smart contracts;power markets;bidirectional auction mechanism;blockchain;electric vehicles (evs);energy trading;internet of evsenergy;scheme;peer;security
1621	技术治理	Apples and Oranges: On How to Measure Node Centrality in Payment Channel Networks	The Bitcoin Lightning Network (LN) disrupts the scenario as a fast and scalable method to make payment transactions off-chain, alongside the Bitcoin network, thereby reducing the on-chain burden. Understanding the topology of the LN is crucial, not only because it is key to performance, but also for ensuring its security and privacy guarantees. The topology of the LN affects, among others, the ability to successfully route payments between nodes, its resilience (against both attacks and random failures), and the privacy of payments. Existing research on LN topology focuses on studying the degree, betweenness, and closeness as metrics that better describe the centrality of nodes. However, to the best of our knowledge, previous studies do not encompass the network as a whole because of the limitation of using only the capacity of channels as its principal property. The contributions of this study are two-fold. On the one hand, this paper discusses the application of classic centrality metrics for evaluating the centrality in the LN. On the other hand, we provide alternative metrics to evaluate centrality. Our approach extends the analysis by adding metrics (strength, Opsahl, current-flow betweenness) and network properties (capacity, fee, balance, channel, and pending Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs)). Based on the results obtained using these metrics, we provide an in-depth analysis of the metric that best defines the centrality of this network.	measurement;bitcoin;channel capacity;public key;blockchains;indexes;semantics;bitcoin lightning network;blockchain;centrality metrics;multigraph;network topology;node centrality;path restrictions;payment channel network

1623	协同技术	Blockchain-Empowered Federated Learning Approach for an Intelligent and Reliable D2D Caching Scheme	Cache-enabled device-to-device (D2D) communication is a potential approach to tackle the resource shortage problem. However, public concerns of data privacy and system security still remain, which thus arises an urgent need for a reliable caching scheme. Fortunately, federated learning (FL) with a distributed paradigm provides an effective way to privacy issue by training a high-quality global model without any raw data exchanges. Besides the privacy issue, blockchain can be further introduced into the FL framework to resist the malicious attacks occurred in D2D caching networks. In this study, we propose a double-layer blockchain-based deep reinforcement FL (BDRFL) scheme to ensure privacy-preserved and caching-efficient D2D networks. In BDRFL, a double-layer blockchain is utilized to further enhance data security. Simulation results first verify the convergence of the BDRFL-based algorithm, and then demonstrate that the download latency of the BDRFL-based caching scheme can be significantly reduced under different types of attacks when compared to some existing caching policies.	device-to-device communication;blockchains;reliability;training;data models;data privacy;privacy;blockchain;device-to-device (d2d) caching;federated learning (fl)things performance;internet
1624	核心技术	A Cross-Chain Trusted Reputation Scheme for a Shared Charging Platform Based on Blockchain	With the development of electric vehicles, the shortage of charging piles (CPs) has gradually been exposed. In response to this situation, CP operators have taken private CPs into the shared charging system. Due to the lack of maintenance personnel for private CPs that join shared charging, users often face the problems of damaged CPs and poor service attitudes of CP owners. Reputation solutions based on third-party platforms face a problem of single-point failures and reputation solutions based on blockchain face problems of storage and query efficiency. To improve storage and query efficiency, this article proposes a multichain charging model that stores different types of information on different blockchains. However, it faces the problem of unreliable information called across chains, when calculating reputation across chains. Therefore, this article proposes a cross-chain trusted smart contract (C2T smart contract) to ensure the authenticity, real-time, and interchain write mutual exclusion of cross-chain information, making reputation calculation in the multichain charging model more convenient and more accurate. Especially, we propose a data mutual trust mechanism based on Merkle proof to ensure the authenticity of cross-chain information and prevent forged information from participating in calculating reputation. Furthermore, we present a data structure composed of multiple counting Bloom filters (MCBFs) to verify the real time of information and filter out non-real-time information, thereby ensuring the real time of the calculated reputation. In addition, we put forward an algorithm to guarantee the interchain write mutual exclusion by hash mutexes, making the reputation calculation process more accurate and complete. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that C2T smart contract is feasible in practice.	charging model;cross-chain;multichain;reputation;smart contract

Moreover, it becomes essential to schedule an electric vehicle for charging optimally. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based electric vehicle charging reservation scheme for optimum pricing. It primarily aims to secure data transactions between electric vehicles and charging stations. It uses the communication channel as 5G to ensure ultra-low latency and extremely high reliability. Furthermore, the proposed scheme uses a double-auction mechanism to optimize the payoff for both electric vehicles and charging stations. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by distinguishing it from the conventional networks such as 4G and LTE-A. The performance parameters are considered profit and loss for electric vehicles, scalability, cost overhead for data storage, communication overhead for data transactions, and data storage cost. Results show that the proposed scheme is secure and achieves the optimized payoff for electric vehicles and charging stations compared with traditional approaches.	blockchain;double-auction mechanism;electric vehicle charging;ethereum;optimum pricing;smart contract

Vehicles wirelessly communicate with other vehicles, sensors, pedestrians, and roadside units, raising data security issues while driving. In order to ensure driving safety, the risk map cognitive model is established with the help of blockchain technology. In this model, the key map data and personal privacy information are encrypted and uploaded to form a blockchain, and the smart contract technology is used for automatic script processing. Then, according to different risk scenarios, cognitive learning is carried out for different risk levels, the cognitive results and corresponding operations are fed back to the intelligent vehicle, and these operations ensure the safe operation of the vehicle according to the intelligent vehicle. Finally, the feasibility of the model was verified by comparing different dangerous scenarios. The experimental results show that this risk cognition model can cognize the data of the intelligent vehicle according to different danger scenarios, and the model can transmit acceleration, deceleration, braking, and other behaviors to the intelligent vehicle to ensure smart city driving safety.	management
1627	协同技术	A blockchain-enabled learning model based on distributed deep learning architecture	Aiming to address the unsatisfactory performance of existing distributed deep learning architectures, such as poor accuracy, slow network communication, low arithmetic speed, and insufficient security, we propose and design a learning model based on a distributed deep learning and blockchain architecture. We use a hybrid parallel algorithm based on blockchain (HP-B) to build a distributed deep consensus learning model. The HP-B algorithm is grouped according to the performance of computing nodes participating in training, network links and training samples, and the grouped computing equipment performs optimal distributed computing. The purpose of this approach is to solve the security and scalability concerns and improve the convergence speed and accuracy of deep learning. The proposed method achieves good results on the CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and IMAGENET data sets. Finally, the distributed deep learning model based on blockchain is combined with the generative adversarial network to solve the segmentation problem of medical imaging data, and the experimental results are superior to those of other networks.	blockchain;distributed deep learning;generative adversarial networks;hybrid parallel algorithm;image segmentationinternet;things;security;scheme
1628	核心技术	Proof of Continuous Work for Reliable Data Storage Over Permissionless Blockchain	Bitcoin first proposed the Nakamoto consensus that applies proof of work into the blockchain structure to build a trustless append-only ledger. The Nakamoto consensus solves the distributed consistency problem in the public network but wastes too much computing power. Instead of consuming computing resources, many improved consensus schemes address this problem by leveraging miners' storage resources. However, these schemes fail to let miners store data constantly and usually rely on a dealer to assign data, which is hard to build a reliable decentralized storage system. In this article, we first design a variant consensus algorithm named Proof of Continuous Work (PoCW) with a storage-related incentive mechanism. Miners can accumulate mining advantage by continuously submitting proofs of storage. Then, we present a hash ring-based data allocation algorithm using the blockchain's state. Combined with both of them, we build a reliable blockchain-based storage system without relying on any third parties. The theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system has higher reliability than those existing systems, and we also give practical suggestions about system parameters. Finally, we discuss additional benefits that our system brings.	blockchains;resource management;data mining;internet of things;bitcoin;servers;reliability theory;blockchain;data allocation;decentralized storage;proof of continuous work (pocw);reliability
1629	核心技术	A Trustworthy Safety Inspection Framework Using Performance-Security Balanced Blockchain	Regular safety inspection is critical to reduce safety risk in industry. Applying the consortium blockchain technology to safety inspection can ensure the effectiveness of the inspection process and tracing of problems. However, there are two major issues when using conventional consortium blockchain. It is challenging to guarantee the authenticity of the retrieved data source, and meanwhile, achieving a balance between performance and security is not easy. Hence, this article proposes a blockchain-based performance-security balanced safety inspection framework (PSB-SIF), in which a safety inspection box is designed to ensure the authenticity of the inspector's identity while inspection logic is executed automatically via smart contracts. In addition, this article also proposes a novel credit scoring-based Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithm, named safety inspection BFT consensus algorithm (SIBFT), which is used to balance the performance and security of consensus network in a safety inspection. We evaluate the proposed approach by comparing with the solutions using RAFT, Practical BFT (PBFT), and SIBFT consensus algorithms in terms of throughput, transaction latency, scalability, and security of PSB-SIF. The evaluation results show that PSB-SIF is efficient for all these quality metrics.	inspection;blockchains;safety;consensus algorithm;security;peer-to-peer computing;internet of things;authenticity;blockchain;consensus;performance-security balance;safetyconsensus algorithm;iot
1630	核心技术	A Proof-of-Transactions Blockchain Consensus Protocol for Large-Scale IoT	Blockchain technology can benefit Internet of Things (IoT) in terms of message exchange, access control, and management; however, existing blockchain consensus protocols cannot provide sufficient performance without compromising security and fairness. This article proposes a round-based two-stage blockchain consensus protocol called Proof-of-Transactions (PoT) for a variety of requirements, such as performance and security of large-scale IoT. In the first stage of each round, all nodes preconstruct new blocks and exchange information about the number of valid transactions contained in each other's blocks. The block containing most valid transactions is broadcasted in the second stage and examined by all nodes of the cluster before being received as the new block in the global blockchain ledger. The consensus reaching of a new block requires only two rounds of message exchange process. Theoretical analysis and experimental results verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed protocol.	peer-to-peer computing;internet of things;consensus protocol;consensus algorithm;throughput;synchronization;indexes;blockchain;consensus;internet of things (iot)internet;things
1631	核心技术	Leader Confirmation Replication for Millisecond Consensus in Private Chains	The private chain-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) system ensures the security of cross-organizational data sharing. As a widely used consensus model in private chains, the leader-based state-machine replication (SMR) model meets the performance bottleneck in IoT blockchain applications, where nontransactional sensor data are generated on a scale. We analyzed IoT private chain systems and found that the leader maintains too many connections due to high latency and client request frequency, which results in lower consensus performance and efficiency. To meet this challenge, we propose a novel solution for maintaining low request latency and high transactions per second (TPS): replicate nontransactional data by followers and confirm by the leader to achieve nonconfliction SMR, rather than all by the leader. Our solution, named leader confirmation replication (LCR), uses the newly proposed future log and confirmation signal to achieve nontransactional data replication on the followers, thereby reducing the leader's network traffic and the request latency of transactional data. In addition, the generation replication strategy is designed to ensure the reliability and consistency of LCR when meeting membership changes. We evaluated LCR with various cluster sizes and network latencies. The experimental results show that in ms-network latency (2-30) environments, the TPS of LCR is 1.4X-1.9X higher than Raft, the transactional data response time is reduced by 40%-60%, and the network traffic is reduced by 20%-30% with acceptable network traffic and CPU cost on the followers. In addition, LCR shows high portability and availability since it does not change the number of leaders or the election process.	protocols;data models;internet of things;load modeling;analytical models;voting;security;confirmation replication;consensus model;private chain;raft;state-machine replication (smr)performance;blockchain
1632	核心技术	Fast and Scalable Distributed Consensus Over Wireless Large-Scale Internet of Things Network	Due to the rapid paradigm shift in Internet of Things networks from wired and centralized to flexible wireless and decentralized networks, building effective and reliable distributed consensus mechanisms over wireless is becoming essential. Especially, since the performance of consensus over communication endpoints in a large-scale wireless network is limited by their communication capability, it requires a careful co-design of communication and consensus to attain a fast and scalable distributed wireless consensus mechanism with high resiliency against faulty nodes. Within this context, this article addresses such problem by designing two wireless consensus mechanisms that well-suit in large-scale wireless networks. On the one hand, as a reinterpretation of the conventional referendum consensus (RC) in a large-scale wireless network, gossip-broadcasting-based RC (GB-RC) is proposed. On the other hand, to overcome the scalability issue of the GB-RC, cooperative-broadcast-based electoral-college consensus (CB-EC) is proposed. By mathematically analyzing the performance of both of the consensus mechanisms, in terms of consensus latency and resiliency against the faulty nodes, we show that the GB-RC outperforms the conventional RC, while the CB-EC significantly reduces the consensus latency compromising the stochastic resiliency. We further evaluate their performance numerically to show their effectiveness and feasibility under realistic large-scale wireless environments.	internet of things;wireless networks;resilience;wireless sensor networks;broadcasting;interference;blockchains;byzantine fault tolerance (bft);cooperative-broadcasting (cb);gossip broadcasting (gb);large-scale wireless network;wireless distributed consensusblockchain systems

However, how to enable the transparency and sustainability of supply chain through blockchain technology is indeed a complex decision-making problem. Based on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, this paper develops a hierarchical enablers framework for improving sustainable supply chain transparency (SSCT) by blockchain technology in the cocoa industry. Then, the best-worst method (BWM) is used to evaluate the weights of main enablers and sub-enablers by a real case of cocoa supply chain in an emerging African economy. The case results indicate the most important main enabler is "Technical Characteristics ", and the top three sub-enablers are: "blockchain smart contract ", "blockchain security, " and "tracking product components ", respectively. The framework and method of this study can help decision-makers and supply chain managers develop strategies to promote the effective application of blockchain to improve SSCT.

As a newly developed compute architecture, edge computing can serve applications that require low latency and high bandwidth better. By sinking cloud computing capabilities to the user side, edge computing collaborates with the cloud and terminals to achieve controlled processing of massive data. Therefore, in order to cache data that meets user requirements better, this paper proposed a blockchain-assisted caching optimization model and data storage method in the edge environment. In this model, factors such as base station location selection and cache content prediction are considered, with the aim of maximizing the quality of service and user interest. During the experiments of caching optimization, when Zipf is 0.5 and other factors remain constant, the proposed algorithm has an average cache hit rate of 4.22%, 11.03%, 19.34%, and 32.35% higher than the JSCCO algorithm, EETCO algorithm, DPCP algorithm, and RR algorithm, respectively. In terms of data storage, when the storage size of the file is 32 MB and other aspects stay constant, the storage time of the proposed method is 16.26%, 16.94%, and 31.56% lower than the IDFS method, EDDS method, and IISM method, respectively.	caching optimization;data storage;blockchain;edge environmentdata placement;strategy

Meanwhile, blockchain is a promising paradigm to decentralize the traditional ledger of a single trusted entity. In this article, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based scheme is proposed to tackle the joint resource allocation and replica selection challenge of VR streaming in blockchain-enabled fog radio access networks (F-RANs). The proposed scheme balances the load on VR streaming and blockchain maintenance and fully exploits the edge caching and computing resources on fog-based access points (F-APs). Thus, less energy is consumed compared with other learning schemes based on extensive simulations.	blockchains;wireless communication;resource management;internet of things;videos;three-dimensional displays;solid modeling;blockchain;deep deterministic policy gradient (ddpg);fog radio access networks (f-rans);virtual reality (vr)wireless networks;latency;360-degrees;challenges;allocation;internet;things;codes
1637	平台项目	A Transaction Traffic Control Approach Based on Fuzzy Logic to Improve Hyperledger Fabric Performance	Blockchain is a potential technology for migrating the central server's processing burden into a decentralized, secure, and transparent manner. This technology has had significant influence and revolution in various industries. However, the limited transaction processing power is a stumbling block, especially compared to proven alternatives like distributed database systems. This paper proposes a transaction traffic control approach based on fuzzy logic to enhance the blockchain network's transaction processing capacity. The proposed fuzzy controller is implemented in the smart contract to adjust the transaction traffic flow in real-time network conditions automatically. An experiment environment is built on Hyperledger Fabric to demonstrate the design approach's significance. According to the experiment results, the blockchain performance is significantly improved compared to the baseline. Furthermore, the proposed approach is integrated with an existing blockchain performance-enhancing tool, and the results indicate that the proposed approach is flexible enough to integrate with other existing approaches.	blockchain

1639	实体经济	Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Healthcare System for IoT Devices Using zk-SNARK	Privacy is playing a crucial role in the smart health industry, where health service providers and their customers use the internet of things (IoT) to provide and consume health services. Preserving privacy for legitimate users and preventing illegitimate users from accessing services are difficult to implement simultaneously. In this study, we addressed this issue by proposing a new healthcare system for IoT based on the blockchain and zero-knowledge succinct noninteractive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK). We employ the anonymity property of the public blockchain to protect users' privacy. The zk-SNARK scheme works as an anonymous authenticator to prevent unauthorized users from using services. We also analyze the security of the proposed system by showing that it can resist various types of attacks, such as impersonation, collusion, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the zk-SNARK scheme with respect to computational costs and the interactions with the Ethereum blockchain smart contract with respect to transaction fees.	medical services;blockchains;internet of things;authentication;privacy;peer-to-peer computing;cryptography;blockchain;healthcare;iot;privacy;zk-snark;anonymous authentication
1640	实体经济	Blockchain in Secure Healthcare Systems: State of the Art, Limitations, and Future Directions	Modern healthcare is a data-intensive domain representing an amalgamation of long-term electronic medical records, real-time patient monitoring data, and more recently sensor data from wearable computing. Blockchain in healthcare can address a multitude of challenges in healthcare, including care coordination, data security, and interoperability concerns, as technology advances. Technical challenges such as processing speed and massive data duplication will be resolved as improved technology. This data needs to be accessed seamlessly by a multitude of players from the general physicians to hospitals, medical service providers to insurance companies. Thus, healthcare-related data needs to be verified, securely stored, and shared while maintaining patient privacy and control over what portion of the data is shared, with whom it is shared, and how it is consumed. Blockchain has emerged as a technology stack of choice for distributed authentication, secure storage, and automated analysis of stored data in diverse domains including healthcare. Its distributed nature is a natural fit to the healthcare ecosystem with multiple participating entities and patients in different geographic locations. In this paper, we review the technology of blockchain to the healthcare domain analyzing and classifying work done in the field. Open challenges are identified and future directions for research are also presented.	
1641	实体经济	A Secure and Privacy-Preserving Medical Data Sharing via Consortium Blockchain	Medical data sharing is of great significance in promoting smart medicine. However, the heterogeneity of information systems used by various medical institutions makes sharing difficult. In addition, since medical data involves a great deal of sensitive information, sharing it could easily lead to the leakage of personal privacy. Blockchain, gained popularity as a distributed ledger technology, has great potential to connect heterogeneous systems and provides authenticity and integrity guarantees for medical data sharing. Focusing on the issues of medical data sharing and privacy protection, we propose a medical data sharing scheme based on consortium blockchain. To achieve access control, attribute-based access control technique is implemented, where patients preset attribute-specific access policies for their medical records, and record requesters are described by a set of attributes. For patients, we devise a hybrid storage mode to write access policies of medical records on the consortium blockchain network and store encrypted medical records off-chain. Leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, access privilege control and access history tracking can be realized. To enhance the key management, a tree of medical records is constructed for each patient, and by simply keeping the medical record trees, patients can recover their encryption keys at any time. Furthermore, we carry out an extensive analysis to show the high security and efficiency of our proposed scheme. Finally, we build a Quorum consortium blockchain on the Tencent Cloud and deploy smart contracts on the chain to simulate transactions in our scheme. The experiment results indicate the proposed scheme achieves good feasibility.	
1642	实体经济	Legal Model Construction Approach of Big Data Transaction Management in the Digital Information Perspective	This paper constructs and applies the legal model of transaction management in the digital information perspective based on the approach of big data. To solve the problem, it is necessary to integrate various legal tools, construct an idealized legal model of big data transaction management, conduct interprofessional and interdisciplinary research on the big data transaction management problems that are difficult to be regulated by the existing legal norms, and selectively design and arrange the corresponding system, to provide the digital regulatory tools for the operation of the digital economy and promote the scientific and standardized development of the digital economy. Based on the decentralized blockchain platform, sealed bidding is used to achieve information isolation among nonconspiratorial data buyers, and through the big data auction algorithm, the purpose of the conspirators cannot be achieved and anticomplicity is realized. The model is based on smart contracts and combined with auction theory to achieve anticollision in the process of big data auctions. Based on the model, we construct an anticomplicity big data auction mechanism and dissect the big data auction algorithm. The correctness of the model and algorithm is demonstrated through simulation. After the data is hosted, the data will be completely owned by the big data trading center. In the data transaction process, the big data transaction center provides data resource information to data buyers, so that data buyers can select the required data. Second is the construction of a multilevel regulatory system in the administrative supervision of the construction of the central national security leading institutions led by the interregional collaborative regulatory system and in the industry self-regulatory supervision of the implementation of the data trading platform data trading supervision obligations. The balance between the development of the data trading industry and data trading security is comprehensively maintained from multiple perspectives of legislation and law enforcement.	data analytics;transformation;system
1643	市场治理	Short-run and long-run determinants of bitcoin returns: transnational evidence	Purpose Bitcoin has emerged as a phenomenal asset earning abnormal profits. However, the factors with predictability power over its price are not widely studied. Therefore, this study aims to explore the factors that determine bitcoin prices. The analysis explores the determinants belonging to four categories - macro economic, financial, technical and fundamental factors. Design/methodology/approach The study employs random effects regression on the panel data of five countries. Then Granger causality test is applied on the time series of all the variables. Lastly, diagnostic tests are conducted to confirm the findings to be robust and reliable. Findings The findings suggest that oil price, bitcoin supply, trading volume and market capitalization significantly impact the price of bitcoin in the long run. In short run, bitcoin returns are only caused by oil price and market capitalization. Interestingly, bitcoin returns influence its attractiveness to investors, market capitalization, S&P 500 returns and trading volume, in the short run. Practical implications The technical analysis is found to be redundant in the short run. In the long run, technical as well as fundamental analysis are useful. The bitcoin is found to be a good diversification tool as it has no linkages with the stock markets and gold market. It is also an inflationary hedger owing its limited supply. Originality/value The studies on cryptocurrency market have not conducted the analysis across countries. This study captures the cross-sectional effects along with time effects. The study also includes 17 variables belonging to four categories.	bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;financial markets;pricing theory;panel analysis;g12;g15;g23;o16cryptocurrencies

That is why one might apply fractional cointegration analysis on daily data over the period 01/09/2019-30/04/2020. Our results indicate the presence of fractional integration in residual series, implying the existence of a fractional cointegration relationship. A short-run joint dynamics between Bitcoin and some other assets (Crude Oil, S & P500 and Natural Gas) is nevertheless well-pronounced. Such analysis of the long and short-term dependencies between different assets could be interesting from a portfolio perspective.	autoregressive time-series

Design/methodology/approach Data consists of 118 monthly observations from September 2010 to June 2020. Due to the departure of series from Gaussian distribution and the existence of outliers, the authors use the quantile analysis framework to investigate the persistency of the shocks, the long-run relationships and Granger causality among the variables. Findings This research provides several important findings. First, the substantial differences between conventional and quantile test results stress the importance of the method selection. Second, throughout the conditional distribution of the series, stochastic properties of the variables, long-run and the causal relationships between the variables might be significantly different. Third, rich information provided by the quantile framework might help the investors design better investment strategies. Originality/value This study differs from the previous research in terms of variable selection and econometric methodology. Therefore, it presents a more comprehensive framework that suggests implications for empirical researchers and Bitcoin investors.	bitcoin;macroeconomic uncertainty;internet search volumes;economic uncertainty related queries;quantile estimation;<bold>g12</bold>;<bold>g15</bold>;<bold>c01</bold>;<bold>c21</bold>;<bold>c58</bold>economic-policy uncertainty;returns;cointegration;causality;sentiment

1647	市场治理	Manipulation of the Bitcoin market: an agent-based study	Fraudulent actions of a trader or a group of traders can cause substantial disturbance to the market, both directly influencing the price of an asset or indirectly by misinforming other market participants. Such behavior can be a source of systemic risk and increasing distrust for the market participants, consequences that call for viable countermeasures. Building on the foundations provided by the extant literature, this study aims to design an agent-based market model capable of reproducing the behavior of the Bitcoin market during the time of an alleged Bitcoin price manipulation that occurred between 2017 and early 2018. The model includes the mechanisms of a limit order book market and several agents associated with different trading strategies, including a fraudulent agent, initialized from empirical data and who performs market manipulation. The model is validated with respect to the Bitcoin price as well as the amount of Bitcoins obtained by the fraudulent agent and the traded volume. Simulation results provide a satisfactory fit to historical data. Several price dips and volume anomalies are explained by the actions of the fraudulent trader, completing the known body of evidence extracted from blockchain activity. The model suggests that the presence of the fraudulent agent was essential to obtain Bitcoin price development in the given time period; without this agent, it would have been very unlikely that the price had reached the heights as it did in late 2017. The insights gained from the model, especially the connection between liquidity and manipulation efficiency, unfold a discussion on how to prevent illicit behavior.	agent-based modelling;cryptocurrency;market manipulation;liquidity;bitcoinorder book;tax evasion;liquidity;technology

1649	核心技术	Knapsack Cipher-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms for cryptanalysis in blockchain-enabled internet of things systems	The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain demand the use of public-key cryptography systems to secure network communications. In this study, one of those public-key algorithms, known as Merkle-Hellman Knapsack Cryptosystem (MHKC), is employed to cryptographically analyze its utilization for blockchain technology using a metaheuristic algorithm. To do so, eight well-known metaheuristic algorithms are employed to determine the trustworthiness of MHKC against cryptoanalysis attacks using various knapsack lengths, ranging from 8 to 32 bits. The experimental findings showed that pathfinder algorithm (PFA) and slime mold optimizer (SMA) could exploit MHKC under 8-bit ASCII code, and their performance gradually deteriorates with higher bit representations, while the performance of manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) could be superior for the knapsack lengths higher than 8-bit. Additionally, MRFO would not attack MHKC under 32-bit; thus, some genetic operators have been integrated to manipulate the binary solutions obtained by this algorithm to promote its exploration capability in a variant, namely HMRFO. The experimental findings revealed that HMRFO is a better alternative to the existing ones for attacking the MHKC with knapsack lengths higher than 8 bit to appear their fragility points, while both SMA and PFA are competitive for 8-bit ASCII code and superior to the other algorithms.	metaheuristic algorithms;knapsack cipher;blockchain;iot;merkle-hellman cryptosystem;cryptanalysis;internet of things (iot)authentication scheme;cryptosystem;pathfinder;iot
1650	核心技术	A survey and taxonomy of consensus protocols for blockchains	Blockchain is an emerging decentralized and distributed technology. Along with the beneficial features of decentralization, transparency, and security the consensus algorithms of blockchains form key building blocks for this technology. Consensus protocol/algorithm helps to provide a decentralized decision making process. An efficient consensus algorithm is inclusive that engages all the participants to make their decision based on the conflicts of the blockchain networks. These consensus decisions lead to better quality outcomes of the blockchains and help to obtain the finality. Rigorous research is in process to upgrade or optimize the existing consensus protocols. The optimized or enhanced consensus protocols objectify to be suitable for Internet-of Thing (IoT) as the current versions of the protocols are not suitable for the resource-constrained environments due their complexity, hard configurations, mining techniques, high resource consumption, and explicit security loophole. In this paper, we present a survey of consensus protocols with a purpose to identify and discuss the existence of various consensus protocols available in literature. We emphasize on the genesis of the consensus protocols, particularly for Proof-of-X, byzantine fault tolerance, Paxos, and RAFT; we also include Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) orientation of some contemporary algorithms. We discuss the variants of these genesis protocols. Our survey analyzes the advantages, disadvantages, and their applicability in IoTs. We enlist the categorical use of consensus algorithms in blockchains and other applications. Finally, we present several research trends and open issues emphasizing for consensus protocols emphasizing on IoTs. Compared to the other surveys in the field, our present survey objectifies to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues; this survey helps the researchers and the application developers to obtain an insight on the current status of the consensus protocols' suitability to deliver the desired functionalities in IoTs. The notified disadvantages of each of the protocol provide future scope for the industries and academia. To the best of our knowledge, such a comprehensive and summarized survey of consensus protocols including DAG-based protocols is unavailable in the literature and thus, our contribution claims are significant.	consensus;blockchain;bitcoin;protocol;decentralizationproofs;scheme
1651	核心技术	A blockchain consensus mechanism that uses Proof of Solution to optimize energy dispatch and trading	Blockchains utilize different consensus mechanisms, among which Proof of Work is one of the more energy and computationally intensive. Chen et al. propose a new mechanism that solves the electricity dispatch problem in grids to establish consensus and demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in distributed energy system management. Traditional centralized optimization and management schemes may be incompatible with a changing energy system whose structure is becoming increasingly distributed. This challenge can hopefully be addressed by blockchain. However, existing blockchains have not been well prepared to integrate mathematical optimization, which plays a key role in many energy system applications. Here we propose a blockchain consensus mechanism tailored to support mathematical optimization problems, called Proof of Solution (PoSo). PoSo mimics Proof of Work (PoW) by replacing the meaningless mathematical puzzle in PoW with a meaningful optimization problem. This is inspired by the fact that both the solutions to the puzzle and to an optimization problem are hard to find but easy to verify. We show the security and necessity of PoSo by using PoSo to enable energy dispatch and trading for two integrated energy systems. The results show that compared with existing optimization schemes, PoSo ensures that only the optimal solution is accepted and executed by participants. Further, compared with existing blockchains, PoSo can seamlessly incorporate mathematical optimization and minimize the workload associated with searching and verifying the optimum.	distributed optimization;smart contract;operation;network;design;system
1652	核心技术	Fault Tolerance Byzantine Algorithm for Lower Overhead Blockchain	A new algorithm for practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), called score-PBFT or S-PBFT, is proposed to solve the problems of high communication overhead and low algorithm efficiency. This algorithm is based on the characteristics of the consortium chain. The scoring mechanism for nodes is added. All the nodes are broken up into consensus nodes, candidate nodes, and early nodes. To make sure the consensus nodes are as reliable as possible, the nodes are changed dynamically based on how each node is behaving. Improved: the election method for the controller node has been changed. The node's score and behaviour are used as the election basis to make the algorithm more stable. In this paper, we want to improve the consensus protocol's execution process, cut down on how many nodes are involved in the consensus process, simplify it, and make it more efficient. Results show that, when compared with the PBFT algorithm, the S-PBFT algorithm has a shorter consensus delay, less communication overhead and throughput, and better consensus node reliability.	
1653	实体经济	Viable Supply Chain Network Design by considering Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency	Nowadays, using Blockchain Technology (BCT) is growing faster in each country. It is essential to apply BCT in Supply Chain Network Design (SCND) and is considered by the designer and manager of SC. This research indicates Viable Supply Chain Network Design (VSCND) by applying BCT. A new form of two-stage robust optimization is suggested. Facility locations and activation BCT for VSCND is the first stage of decisions; finally, we determine flow transshipment between components in the next stage. The GAMS-CPLEX is used for solving the model. The results show that running BCT will decrease 0.99% in costs. There is an economic justification for using BCT when demand is high. A fix-and-optimize and Lagrange relaxation (LR) generate lower and upper bound to estimate large scale in minimum time. The gap between the main model and fix-and-optimize is better than the LR algorithm. Finally, this research suggests equipping VSCND by BCT that becomes more resilient against demand fluctuation, sustainable, and agile.	
1654	实体经济	The acceptance and continued use of blockchain technology in supply chain management: a unified model from supply chain professional's stance	Purpose This study pinpoints the critical factors influencing the acceptance of blockchain technology in supply chain management in the light of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) with additional factors personal innovativeness in technology and user's self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach The questionnaire-based data was obtained from SC professionals in China (Beijing). The essential factors influencing it are evaluated through structural equation modeling (SEM), using AMOS software. Findings The empirical findings specify that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, price value, hedonic motivation, user self-efficacy, and personal innovativeness are positively influencing user satisfaction. User satisfaction has a substantial progressive effect on habit. Furthermore, facilitating conditions, price value, habit, user self-efficacy, personal innovativeness, and user satisfaction have a progressive impact on continued intention to use blockchain technology in supply chain management. Originality/value Although numerous studies investigated the influencing factors of blockchain technology adoption in supply chain management, no study examined the determinants of UTAUT2. However, this study not only empirically studied the UTAUT2 model but also extended it with the most influencing elements such as personal innovativeness in technology and user's self-efficacy. Furthermore, this study contributes to the BT-enabled SCM literature by studying the continued use and acceptance, rather than testing behavioral intention and initial adoption which is common in previous studies of BT-enabled SCM. Finally, this study discusses the limitations, future directions, and managerial implications of the results so that supply chain professionals can deliver what supply chain stakeholders require.	supply chain management (scm);blockchain technology;user self-efficacy;personal innovativeness;utaut2;chinainformation-technology;extending utaut2;adoption;satisfaction;intentions;innovation;variables;consumer;impact;care

This paper also reveals the use of blockchain for sustainable supply chain management across four major sectors, namely food, healthcare, manufacturing, and infrastructure, and concludes with suggestions for future research in each sector.	bibliometric analysis;blockchain;supply chain;sustainability;systematic literature reviewpredatory journals;technology;logistics;traceability;environment;challenges;operations;transport;framework;barriers
1656	协同技术	Integration of Edge Computing and Blockchain for Provision of Data Fusion and Secure Big Data Analysis for Internet of Things	Intelligent computing provides efficient, real-time, and secure data analysis services for the Internet of Things (IoT). As the number of IoT devices increases, IoT generates massive, diverse, and multisourcing datasets that can be used to improve IoT services further. Models trained by intelligent computing from a single system or sensor are often not global, and sending all data directly to the computing platform wastes network bandwidth and may cause network congestion and even privacy leakage. To ensure IoT applications' quality of service and privacy, we propose a framework that integrates edge computing and blockchain to provide lightweight data fusion and secure data analysis for IoT. We propose a lightweight data fusion method that can reduce the amount of data at the node level and prevent network congestion and bandwidth waste. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical fuzzy hashing method to check and locate anomalies of IoT machine learning models to ensure the validity of IoT intelligent computing and the security of sensitive data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper through experiments.	energy-efficient
1657	核心技术	Review of Automated Vulnerability Analysis of Smart Contracts on Ethereum	Programs on public blockchains often handle valuable assets, making them attractive targets for attack. At the same time, it is challenging to design correct blockchain applications. Checking code for potential vulnerabilities is a viable option to increase trust. Therefore, numerous methods and tools have been proposed with the intention to support developers and analysts in detecting code vulnerabilities. Moreover, publications keep emerging with different focus, scope, and quality, making it difficult to keep up with the field and to identify relevant trends. Thus, regular reviews are essential to keep pace with the varied developments in a structured manner. Regarding blockchain programs, Ethereum is the platform most widely used and best documented. Moreover, applications based on Ethereum are entrusted with billions of USD. Like on similar blockchains, they are subject to numerous attacks and losses due to vulnerabilities that exist at all levels of the ecosystem. Countermeasures are in great demand. In this work, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR) to assess the state of the art regarding automated vulnerability analysis of smart contracts on Ethereum with a focus on classifications of vulnerabilities, detection methods, security analysis tools, and benchmarks for the assessment of tools. Our initial search of the major on-line libraries yields more than 1,300 publications. For the review, we apply a clear strategy and protocol to assure consequent, comprehensive, and reproducible documentation and results. After collecting the initial results, cleaning up references, removing duplicates and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we retain 303 publications that include 214 primary studies, 70 surveys and 19 SLRs. For quality appraisal, we assess their intrinsic quality (derived from the reputation of the publication venue) as well as their contextual quality (determined by rating predefined criteria). For about 200 publications with at least a medium score, we extract the vulnerabilities, methods, and tools addressed, among other data. In a second step, we synthesize and structure the data into a classification of both the smart contract weaknesses and the analysis methods. Furthermore, we give an overview of tools and benchmarks used to evaluate tools. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion.	systematic literature review;taxonomy;security;tools;vulnerability;analysis;benchmarksecurity

1659	实体经济	An integrated framework for blockchain-enabled supply chain trust management towards smart manufacturing	With the development of a new generation of information technology, smart manufacturing has put forward higher requirements for supply chain. It is necessary to ensure the synchronization of the supply chain operation and maintain the reliability of the supply chain management, therefore the trust evaluation for the supply chain becomes extremely important. Traditional supply chain management has problems such as information flow is easy to be tampered with, logistics is difficult to trace, and capital flow is not true, which leads to increased opportunity costs due to the lack of trust among transaction entities in the supply chain. The emergence of blockchain technology provides an opportunity to improve the supply chain ecosystem. In this paper, an integrated framework for blockchain-enabled supply chain trust management towards smart manufacturing is proposed to explain how to enhance trust management with the help of blockchain from the perspectives of information flow, logistics, and capital flow. An optimized trust management model is designed for better entities evaluation in supply chain.

1660	协同技术	Optimized Bandwidth Allocation for MEC Server in Blockchain-Enabled IoT Networks	Powered by the development of the fifth-generation mobile communication technology (5G), the Internet of things (IoT) has been widely applied in people's life. Due to the limitation of storage and computing power, the data transmission of IoT devices faces challenges in terms of security and privacy. Therefore, many researchers provide the conjunction of blockchain and mobile edge computing (MEC) to make up for the lack of computing and security. MEC can meet the storage and computing requirements for IoT devices. Blockchain can provide a decentralized, antitamper solution that can help devices overcome security deficiencies, whereas the speed of blockchain communication is not fast enough because of the consensus mechanism. In this article, we focus on the permissioned blockchain and propose an optimized bandwidth allocation algorithm to promote the performance of consensus communication. The algorithm contains an In-Network control ideology and supports deployment on MEC servers. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to perform the computation of available bandwidth in our scheme. We implement a prototype system in the testbed and perform a simulation, and the results show the advantages compared with the current widely used algorithm. By applying our method, the Internet of things devices can transmit data safely and efficiently.	
1661	协同技术	Schloss: Blockchain-Based System Architecture for Secure Industrial IoT	Industrial companies can use blockchain to assist them in resolving their trust and security issues. In this research, we provide a fully distributed blockchain-based architecture for industrial IoT, relying on trust management and reputation to enhance nodes' trustworthiness. The purpose of this contribution is to introduce our system architecture to show how to secure network access for users with dynamic authorization management. All decisions in the system are made by trustful nodes' consensus and are fully distributed. The remarkable feature of this system architecture is that the influence of the nodes' power is lowered depending on their Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), and the nodes' significance and authority is determined by their behavior in the network. This impact is based on game theory and an incentive mechanism for reputation between nodes. This system design can be used on legacy machines, which means that security and distributed systems can be put in place at a low cost on industrial systems. While there are no numerical results yet, this work, based on the open questions regarding the majority problem and the proposed solutions based on a game-theoretic mechanism and a trust management system, points to what and how industrial IoT and existing blockchain frameworks that are focusing only on the power of PoW and PoS can be secured more effectively.	security;trust management;authorization;authentication;blockchain;industry 4.0;game theorykey generation
1662	市场治理	Real-world model for bitcoin price prediction	Cryptocurrency is a new sort of digital asset that has evolved as a result of advances in financial technology, and it has provided a significant research opportunity. There are many algorithms for price prediction for crypto currencies like LSTM and ARIMA. However, the downside is that LSTM-based RNNs are difficult to comprehend, and gaining intuition into their behavior is tough. In order to produce decent outcomes, rigorous hyperparameter adjustment is also essential. Furthermore, crypto currencies do not precisely adhere to past data, and patterns change fast, reducing the accuracy of predictions. Cryptocurrency price forecasting is difficult due to price volatility and dynamism. Because the data is dynamic and heavily influenced by various seasons, the ARIMA model is unable to handle seasonal data. In order to provide better price predictions for crypto traders, a new model is required. The objective of the study is to apply Fbprophet model as the key model because it is superior in functionality as compared to LSTM and ARIMA additionally removing the pitfalls generated in LSTM and ARIMA model while analyzing the cryptocurrency data. This study provides a methodology for predicting the future price of bitcoin that does not rely solely on past data due to seasonality in historical data. So, after fitting the seasonality and smoothing, the model is constructed that can be useful for real-world use cases. In case of crypto currencies where less historical data is available and it is hard to find pattern, proposed method can easily deal this type of problems. Overall difference between predicted and actual values is low as compared to other model even after seasonal data was available.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;machine learning;prediction;time series analysis;fbprophet modelneural-network;hybrid arima

Subsequently, the co-movements of the coronavirus proxies with PSY measurement using the wavelet approach were studied. Findings Short-lived bubbles are detected at the beginning of the studied period, and more extended bubble periods are identified at the end. Besides, the empirical results show evidence of significant negative co-movement between each pandemic proxy and each cryptocurrency bubble measurement. Research limitations/implications Given the complex financial dynamics of the cryptocurrency markets due to some behavioral biases in some circumstances, investors can benefit from the date stamping of the bubbles bursting to make the best trading positions. In the same way, governments could support the healthy development of cryptocurrencies by preventing bubbles during such pandemics. Originality/value The financial bubble is commonly attributed to a change in investor behavior. Because traders and investors think they can resell the asset at a higher price in the future. This study explored the contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic in the creation of these bubbles by date stamping their occurrence and explosive periods. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt that explores the contribution of the COVID-19 pandemic to the creation of bubbles caused by a change in the investors' behavior.	cryptocurrency;continuous wavelet;wavelet coherence;investor behavior;market bubbles;covid-19;c58;e44;g01;h12wavelet transform;coherence;bitcoin
1664	实体经济	Blockchain Based Smart-Grid Stackelberg Model for Electricity Trading and Price Forecasting Using Reinforcement Learning	A smart grid is an intelligent electricity network that allows efficient electricity distribution from the source to consumers through telecommunication technology. The legacy smart grid follows the centralized oligopoly marketplace for electricity trading. This research proposes a blockchain-based electricity marketplace for the smart grid environment to introduce a decentralized ledger in the electricity market for enabling trust and traceability among the stakeholders. The electricity prices in the smart grid are dynamic in nature. Therefore, price forecasting in smart grids has paramount importance for the service providers to ensure service level agreement and also to maximize profit. This research introduced a Stackelberg model-based dynamic retail price forecasting of electricity in a smart grid. The Stackelberg model considered two-stage pricing between electricity producers to retailers and retailers to customers. To enable adaptive and dynamic price forecasting, reinforcement learning is used. Reinforcement learning provides an optimal price forecasting strategy through the online learning process. The use of blockchain will connect the service providers and consumers in a more secure transaction environment. It will help tackle the centralized system's vulnerability by performing transactions through customers' smart contracts. Thus, the integration of blockchain will not only make the smart grid system more secure, but also price forecasting with reinforcement learning will make it more optimized and scalable.	smart grid;blockchain;price forecasting;electricity demand and supply;smart meter;reinforcement learning;stackelberg modeldemand response algorithm;management

This paper describes a new system based on blockchain approach to store students' records accumulated in the educational process at the higher institution in extended format. Every block of the records contains four types of information about student: academic activities, research participation, cultural activities and achievements. The system suggests participation of educational institution, student and potential employers in usage of integrated machine learning and blockchain technologies. The novelty of our paper is that the system allows university and student to keep complete and accurate data about the entire student learning process, avoid forgeries of educational records, e-portfolio inaccuracies and fabricated degrees. Additionally, it could be used by employers to find qualifying potential employees, using large amount of verified and systematically accumulated data.	academic records;artificial intelligence (ai);blockchain;competencies;educational process;machine learning (ml);student performance
1666	实体经济	Study the path planning of intelligent robots and the application of blockchain technology	With the improvement of China's science and technology, robot technology has been widely developed and applied. The most significant feature of China's intelligent robot technology advancement is the combination of embedded systems and robotics. Embedded systems have higher specific integration and lower power consumption. The binocular vision is introduced into the embedded system, and the inheritance and development of the algorithm is facilitated by the transplantation and use of the OpenCV vision library. Compared with the traditional method of using a separate vision chip, the development cost is saved and the application prospect is broad. Such advantages not only can fully meet the real-time nature of the system, but also can simplify the development of control software to a certain extent. The blockchain system using the proof-of-work mechanism can complete the issuance and transfer of digital assets in the presence of untrusted nodes. Different blockchains can obtain different security based on different economic incentives and punishment mechanisms. Among them, the proof of work is still the most secure consensus mechanism in the blockchain. According to the actual needs of embedded intelligent robot path planning, by comparing the advantages and disadvantages of existing algorithms and the practical ability of the external environment, a path planning algorithm based on the combination of A* and artificial potential field method is proposed. In the simulation experiments of this paper, the potential field ant colony algorithm rasterizes the environment, reduces the probability that the resultant force of the robot is zero, and increases the pheromone concentration in the direction of the resultant force, and converts the direction factor of the force into the pheromone factor. The ability to avoid obstacles is improved, the algorithm is prevented from falling into a local optimal situation, and the global optimal path is searched with path constraints (33.799).

1667	核心技术	Security Consensus Algorithm of Medical Data Based on Credit Rating	In order to defend against malicious node attacks and improve consensus efficiency in the blockchain-based medical data sharing system, a Security Consensus Algorithm of Medical Data (SCA_MD) based on credit rating is proposed. In SCA_MD, the medical block consensus model which consists of data-based nodes, consensus nodes and supervisory nodes is considered. The corresponding node identity verification mechanism is proposed to achieve rapid verification. Then, a Self-optimizing Credit Rating Division (SCRD) algorithm based on marine predators is proposed to limit the consensus power of malicious nodes. Finally, the voting mechanism and consensus mechanism of representative nodes are proposed to improve the efficiency of consensus. The experimental results show that no matter how the number of malicious nodes changes, SCA_MD can increase transaction throughput, and reduce average transaction delay and average node communication overhead.	bockchain;medical data;security consensus;cedit grade
1668	元分析	Artificial intelligence in industrial design: A semi-automated literature survey	In the era of industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) may potentially be used to provide reasoning and decision support on engineering and technical challenges. The role of AI in industrial design, which is the practice of improving the function, value and aesthetics of products to optimise customer satisfaction, has not yet been extensively explored. To effectively synthesise the existing literature, an unsupervised learning-enabled review methodology is proposed in this study. Important journals and articles are identified by using k-means clustering, and the relevant articles are analysed by using co-citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-occurrence analyses. Six clusters of the body of knowledge are then extracted, and naming of the clusters is assisted by using document summarisation and evaluation. Consequently, six intellectual cores related to AI in industrial design are formulated: (i) supply chain perspectives on product design and innovation, (ii) manufacturability and performance of new product development, (iii) intelligent tools and systems for industrial design and engineering, (iv) applied intelligence for product and service innovation, (v) industry 4.0 technologies for design and manufacturing, and (vi) blockchain-enabled artificial intelligence in industry 4.0. Future research trends on sustainable design, trust in AI, and emerging technology integration towards the next-generation AI in industrial design are discussed.	artificial intelligence;industrial design;review;text analytics;industry 4;0cyber-physical systems;relationship management-system;reasoning approach;internet;ai;methodology;challenges;innovation;networks;platform
1669	虚拟经济	Multimedia Research Toward the Metaverse	Metaverse, a set of fully immersive digital worlds where people can interact with one another using three-dimensional (3-D) avatars, is poised to become an increasingly popular modality to communicate with others. Many in the space consider it an evolution of the Internet, with augmented and virtual reality headsets providing the hardware to both visualize and interact with it. However, creating custom 3-D content and environments for a digital world can be extremely time-consuming and costly compared to typical web pages. To this end, research in procedural content generation is required to empower the efficient creation of high-quality multimedia contents for the metaverse. One other core concern when creating a fully decentralized metaverse is the need to download relevant environments on demand as people traverse across different worlds. Further research by the multimedia community on efficient multimedia networking, storage, and compression is necessary to ensure that digital worlds remain easily accessible to others.	
1670	实体经济	VaCoChain: Blockchain-Based 5G-Assisted UAV Vaccine Distribution Scheme for Future Pandemics	This paper proposes a generic scheme VaCoChain, that fuses blockchain (BC) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) underlying fifth-generation (5G) communication services for timely vaccine distribution during novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and future pandemics. The scheme offers 5G-tactile internet (5G-TI) based services for UAV communication networks (UAVCN) monitored through ground controller stations (GCs). 5G-TI enabled UAVCN supports real-time dense connectivity at ultra-low round-trip time (RTT) latency of < 1 ms and high availability of 99.99999%. Thus, it can support resilient vaccine distributions in a phased manner at government-designated nodal centers (NCs) with reduced round trip delays from vaccine production warehouses (VPW). Further, UAVCNs ensure minimizes human intervention and controls vaccine health conditions due to shorter trip times. Once vaccines are supplied at NCs warehouses, then the BC ensures timestamped documentation of vaccinated persons with chronology, auditability, and transparency of supply-chain checkpoints from VPW to NCs. Through smart contracts (SCs), priority groups can be formed for vaccination based on age, healthcare workers, and general commodities. In the simulation, for UAV efficacy, we have compared the scheme against fourth-generation (4G)-assisted long term evolution-advanced (LTE-A), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and traditional logistics for round-trip time (RTT) latency, logistics, and communication costs. In the BC setup, we have compared the scheme against the existing 5G-TI delivery scheme (Gupta et al.) for processing latency, packet losses, and transaction time. For example, in communication costs, the proposed scheme achieves an average improvement of 9.13 for block meta-information. For 4000 transactions, the proposed scheme has a communication latency of 16 s compared to 36 s. The packet loss is significantly reduced to 2.5% using 5G-TI compared to 16% in 4G-LTE-A. The proposed scheme has a computation cost of 1.6 ms and a communication cost of 157 bytes, which indicates the scheme efficacy against conventional approaches.	vaccines;covid-19;unmanned aerial vehicles;pandemics;drugs;production;computer architecture;blockchain;covid-19;future pandemics;5g;tactile internet;unmanned aerial vehicles;vaccine distributionsdrones;delivery;5g
1671	实体经济	On the Design of Blockchain-Based ECDSA With Fault-Tolerant Batch Verification Protocol for Blockchain-Enabled IoMT	The blockchain-enabled internet of medical things (IoMT) is an emerging paradigm that could provide strong trust establishment and ensure the traceability of data sharing in the IoMT networks. One of the fundamental building blocks for Blockchain is Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Nevertheless, when processing a large number of transactions, the verification of multiple signatures will incur cumbersome overhead to the nodes in Blockchain. Although batch verification is able to provide a promising approach that verifies multiple signatures simultaneously and efficiently, the upper bound of batch size is limited to small-scale and the efficiency will drop rapidly as the batch size grows in the state-of-the-art ECDSA batch schemes. Meanwhile, most of the existing researches only focus on improving the efficiency of batch verification algorithms in various cryptosystem while ignoring the identification of invalid signatures, which could cause severe performance degradation when the batch verification fails. Motivated by these observations, this paper proposes an efficient and large-scale batch verification scheme with group testing technology based on ECDSA. The application of the presented protocols in Bitcoin and Hyperledger Fabric has been analyzed as supportive and effective. When the batch verification returns a false result, we utilize group testing technology to improve the efficiency of identifying invalid signatures. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our protocol outperforms the related ECDSA batch verification schemes.	blockchains;bitcoin;testing;protocols;time complexity;public key;elliptic curves;iomt;blockchain;ecdsa;batch verification;group testingauthentication;computation;internet;bitcoin;scheme

1673	实体经济	A Review of Blockchain Technology Applications in Ambient Assisted Living	The adoption of remote assisted care was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of system acquires data from various sensors, runs analytics to understand people's activities, behavior, and living problems, and disseminates information with healthcare stakeholders to support timely follow-up and intervention. Blockchain technology may offer good technical solutions for tackling Internet of Things monitoring, data management, interventions, and privacy concerns in ambient assisted living applications. Even though the integration of blockchain technology with assisted care is still at the beginning, it has the potential to change the health and care processes through a secure transfer of patient data, better integration of care services, or by increasing coordination and awareness across the continuum of care. The motivation of this paper is to systematically review and organize these elements according to the main problems addressed. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies conducted that address the solutions for integrating blockchain technology with ambient assisted living systems. To conduct the review, we have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology with clear criteria for including and excluding papers, allowing the reader to effortlessly gain insights into the current state-of-the-art research in the field. The results highlight the advantages and open issues that would require increased attention from the research community in the coming years. As for directions for further research, we have identified data sharing and integration of care paths with blockchain, storage, and transactional costs, personalization of data disclosure paths, interoperability with legacy care systems, legal issues, and digital rights management.	ambient assisted living;blockchain;security and privacy;iot blockchain integration;decentralizationhealth-care;iot;framework;internet;system;authentication;information;integration;challenges;management
1674	实体经济	CP-BDHCA: Blockchain-Based Confidentiality-Privacy Preserving Big Data Scheme for Healthcare Clouds and Applications	Healthcare big data (HBD) allows medical stakeholders to analyze, access, retrieve personal and electronic health records (EHR) of patients. Mostly, the records are stored on healthcare cloud and application (HCA) servers, and thus, are subjected to end-user latency, extensive computations, single-point failures, and security and privacy risks. A joint solution is required to address the issues of responsive analytics, coupled with high data ingestion in HBD and secure EHR access. Motivated from the research gaps, the paper proposes a scheme, that integrates blockchain (BC)-based confidentiality-privacy (CP) preserving scheme, CP-BDHCA, that operates in two phases. In the first phase, elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC)-based digital signature framework, HCA-ECC is proposed to establish a session key for secure communication among different healthcare entities. Then, in the second phase, a two-step authentication framework is proposed that integrates Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES), named as HCA-RSAE that safeguards the ecosystem against possible attack vectors. CP-BDAHCA is compared against existing HCA cloud applications in terms of parameters like response time, average delay, transaction and signing costs, signing and verifying of mined blocks, and resistance to DoS and DDoS attacks. We consider 10 BC nodes and create a real-world customized dataset to be used with SEER dataset. The dataset has 30,000 patient profiles, with 1000 clinical accounts. Based on the combined dataset the proposed scheme outperforms traditional schemes like AI4SAFE, TEE, Secret, and IIoTEED, with a lower response time. For example, the scheme has a very less response time of 300 ms in DDoS. The average signing cost of mined BC transactions is 3,34 seconds, and for 205 transactions, has a signing delay of 1405 ms, with improved accuracy of approximate to 12% than conventional state-of-the-art approaches.	medical services;cryptography;cloud computing;stakeholders;elliptic curve cryptography;ecosystems;servers;blockchain;secure session key management;ecc signatures;pairing-based cryptography;dos and ddos attacks;healthcare cloud and applications;big dataexecution environment;framework;internet;things
1675	实体经济	Privacy-Preserved Electronic Medical Record Exchanging and Sharing: A Blockchain-Based Smart Healthcare System	The digitization of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) provides potential access to a wealth of medical information, but also presents new challenges in privacy-preserved EMR exchanging and sharing. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based smart healthcare system with fine-grained privacy protection for reliable data exchanging and sharing among different users. We design a blockchain-enabled dynamic access control framework combined with Local Differential Privacy (LDP) strategies to provide the attribute-based privacy protection in transaction workflow. We design four types of smart contracts in the framework to meet the requirements of anonymous transaction, dynamic access control, beneficial matching decision, and evaluation of published data in an open network. To satisfy fine-grained privacy protection, we classify sensitive attributes of EMRs into different levels and set differential privacy budgets to randomize attributes before data publishing. Also, we design data quality function to depict the disturbance incurred by LDP-based privacy preferences at the requester view, and present appropriate many-to-many matching decisions among participants for beneficial transactions. Finally, we develop a prototype system and test our approach using 200,000 real-world EMRs. Experimental results show that the proposed privacy-preserved scheme can make stable and reliable transactions between EMR publishers and requesters. The prototype system achieves individual-centric privacy configuration at the patient site, while providing error-guaranteed statistics at the requester site. Additionally, the access control policies, logs of anonymous transaction are kept in the blockchain to provide system-level traceability.	access control;medical services;blockchains;privacy;smart contracts;medical diagnostic imaging;vehicle dynamics;blockchain;electronic medical records;dynamic access control;privacy computing;smart healthcareinternet
1676	协同技术	Novel Security Models for IoT-Fog-Cloud Architectures in a Real-World Environment	With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a demand for computation at network edges because of the limited processing capacity of IoT devices. Fog computing is a middle layer that has appeared to address the latency issues between the Internet of things (IoT) and the cloud. Fog computing is becoming more important as companies face increasing challenges in collecting and sending data from IoT devices to the cloud. However, this has led to new security and privacy issues as a result of the large number of sensors in IoT environments as well as the massive amount of data that must be analyzed in real time. To overcome the security challenges between the IoT layer and fog layer and, thus, meet the security requirements, this paper proposes a fine-grained data access control model based on the attribute-based encryption of the IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture to limit the access to sensor data and meet the authorization requirements. In addition, this paper proposes a blockchain-based certificate model for the IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture to authenticate IoT devices to fog devices and meet the authentication requirements. We evaluated the performance of the two proposed security models to determine their efficiency in real-life experiments of the IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture. The results demonstrate that the performance of the IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture with and without the blockchain-based certificate model was the same when using one, two, or three IoT devices. However, the performance of the IoT-Fog-Cloud architecture without the access control model was slightly better than that of the architecture with the model when using one, two, or three IoT devices.	blockchain;aws cloud metrics;fog computing;access control;cloud computing;authentication;internet of things;authorization
1677	协同技术	Power IoT System Architecture Integrating Trusted Computing and Blockchain	With the construction of power Internet of Things, the network scale is constantly expanding, the network structure is increasingly complex, and the number of terminals is increasing rapidly, resulting in huge pressure on network security protection, and it is urgent to build a credible operation environment to ensure that the Internet of Things runs safely and reliably. This paper proposes a power Internet of Things architecture combining trusted computing and blockchain. The architecture ensures the credibility and security of the terminal based on remote integrity verification and access control policy verification. A method for malicious node detection based on blockchain (MMNDB) is placed in acquisition layer. It is used to monitor the status of each acquisition devices in time, detect the malicious terminal in time, isolate the suspicious terminal with low credibility from the power Internet of Things, and ensure credibility of the acquisition terminal and the data collected. Under premise of ensuring the communication efficiency of the power communication network, this architecture can greatly ensure the stable working of the power Internet of Things.	internet;lightweight;security
1678	市场治理	Are green bonds and sustainable cryptocurrencies truly sustainable? Evidence from a wavelet coherence analysis	This article aims to explore the co-movement of daily returns among S&P green bonds (GB/GBs), the top five sustainable cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSWI) and the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Market Index (DJSEMI) to determine whether GBs, Bitcoin and sustainable cryptocurrencies are truly sustainable; in addition, it investigates hedging and diversification opportunities. Using a partial wavelet coherence framework to capture the bivariate co-movement, our findings show strong (weak) positive co-movements among GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) and DJSWI returns, where GBs (sustainable cryptocurrencies) have a heterogeneous leading role in the short-term and long-term horizons. Results indicate moderate positive (negative) co-movement among GBs and sustainable cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and DJSWI in the short run (long run). Overall, the results show GB (sustainable cryptocurrencies) acts as a diversifier for Bitcoin and sustainable cryptocurrencies in most cases (DJSWI). However, increasing Bitcoin returns adversely impacts the DJSWI in the long run. Findings are equally imperative for green investors, crypto traders and policymakers, where investors and traders can earn financial and social returns, and policy-makers can deploy suitable policies for the development of sustainable cryptocurrency mining processes. The role of Bitcoin is alarming for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and global greener economy.	green bonds;sustainable cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;sustainability world index;wavelet coherence;diversifierenergy-consumption

Our samples include papers published in journals ranked across different fields in ABS ranked journals. We conduct a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer software and perform a literature review. Our findings are presented in terms of methodologies used to model cryptocurrencies' volatility and also according to their main findings pertaining to volatility and risk management in those assets and using them in portfolio management. Our research indicates that the models that consider the Markov-switching regime seem to be more consensual among the authors, and that the best machine learning technique performances are hybrid models that consider the support vector machines (SVM). We also argue that the predictability of volatility, risk reduction, and level of speculation in the cryptocurrency market are improved by the leverage effects and the volatility persistence.	cryptocurrencies;bitcoin;volatility;management risk;slr;bibliometric analysisbitcoin;gold;spillovers;currencies;dollar
1680	实体经济	A Distributed Authentication Scheme Based on Smart Contract for Roaming Service in Mobile Vehicular Networks	Secure and real-time communication is an essential condition in mobile vehicular networks, and this requires secure authentication and seamless access enabled by roaming services. As a security inspector, roaming authentication ensures that legitimate users can access the network securely. However, today's roaming authentication protocols authenticate users with the help of centralized authentication servers, leading to the risk of the single point of failure and roaming fraud. The massive device access in SO networks further exacerbates the losses when problems occur. In light of it, we propose a decentralized fraud-proof roaming authentication framework based on blockchain. We leverage smart contracts to implement a roaming authentication protocol, including user/AP registration, authentication, and revocation. For higher efficiency, we utilize the Bloom filter for the revocation process. In addition, we design an unforgeable and undeniable billing scheme based on hash chain technology. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed roaming authentication scheme can provide the required security features while incurring an acceptable authentication delay.	blockchain;distributed authentication;mobile vehicular network;roaming authentication;smart contractpreserving authentication;anonymous authentication;secure;management;blockchain;protocol;challenges;access
1681	实体经济	Blockchain Technology Applied in IoV Demand Response Management: A Systematic Literature Review	Energy management in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is becoming more prevalent as the usage of distributed Electric Vehicles (EV) grows. As a result, Demand Response (DR) management has been introduced to achieve efficient energy management in IoV. Through DR management, EV drivers are allowed to adjust their energy consumption and generation based on a variety of parameters, such as cost, driving patterns and driving routes. Nonetheless, research in IoV DR management is still in its early stages, and the implementation of DR schemes faces a number of significant hurdles. Blockchain is used to solve some of them (e.g., incentivization, privacy and security issues, lack of interoperability and high mobility). For instance, blockchain enables the introduction of safe, reliable and decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. The combination of blockchain and IoV is a new promising approach to further improve/overcome the aforementioned limitations. However, there is limited literature in Demand Response Management (DRM) schemes designed for IoV. Therefore, there is a need for a systematic literature review (SLR) to collect and critically analyze the existing relevant literature, in an attempt to highlight open issues. Thus, in this article, we conduct a SLR, investigating how blockchain technology assists the area of DRM in IoV. We contribute to the body of knowledge by offering a set of observations and research challenges on blockchain-based DRM in IoV. In doing so, we allow other researchers to focus their work on them, and further contribute to this area.	blockchain;smart grid;internet of vehicles;demand response;systematic literature reviewenergy markets;community;internet
1682	核心技术	CyberChain: Cybertwin Empowered Blockchain for Lightweight and Privacy-Preserving Authentication in Internet of Vehicles	Internet of Vehicles (IoVs) presents promising opportunities for vehicle to everything (V2X) applications, wherein authentication acts as the cornerstone to realize trustworthy vehicular context and to support advanced applications. However, existing authentication schemes mainly depend on centralized servers with both security and privacy issues. In this paper, we propose a CyberTwin (CT) empowered blockchain framework for authentication, namely CyberChain, to reduce both the communication and storage cost while maintaining vehicular privacy. By designing a blockchain system in the cyberspace, we decouple the consensus process from the physical world, so that the operation cost of blockchain can be reduced. A Privacy-Preserving Parallel Pedersen Commitment (P4C) algorithm is designed to protect the privacy of vehicles and accelerate the authentication process. To further enhance the operation efficiency of CyberChain, we propose a Diffused Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPBFT) mechanism to reach consensus in the cyberspace that can reduce consensus latency. The proposed cyberchain framework and the associated mechanisms are evaluated by qualitative analysis and simulations. The evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed cyberchain based framework significantly improves the authentication performance in terms of authentication latency, privacy, communication overhead and storage cost.	authentication;blockchains;cyberspace;security;privacy;handover;vehicle dynamics;cybertwin;blockchain;authentication;internet of vehicles;6gnetworks;challenges;scheme
1683	实体经济	Enhancing Food Supply Chain Security through the Use of Blockchain and TinyML	Food safety is a fundamental right in modern societies. One of the most pressing problems nowadays is the provenance of food and food-related products that citizens consume, mainly due to several food scares and the globalization of food markets, which has resulted in food supply chains that extend beyond nations or even continent boundaries. Food supply networks are characterized by high complexity and a lack of openness. There is a critical requirement for applying novel techniques to verify and authenticate the origin, quality parameters, and transfer/storage details associated with food. This study portrays an end-to-end approach to enhance the security of the food supply chain and thus increase the trustfulness of the food industry. The system aims at increasing the transparency of food supply chain monitoring systems through securing all components that those consist of. A universal information monitoring scheme based on blockchain technology ensures the integrity of collected data, a self-sovereign identity approach for all supply chain actors ensures the minimization of single points of failure, and finally, a security mechanism, that is based on the use of TinyML's nascent technology, is embedded in monitoring devices to mitigate a significant portion of malicious behavior from actors in the supply chain.	blockchain;food supply chain;transparency;traceability;smart contracts;internet of things;hardware;machine learning;tinyml;security;integritytraceability;transparency;safety;management;system;waste
1684	实体经济	Blockchain Technology: Potential Applications for Public Sector E-Procurement and Project Management	Project implementations normally fail due to sustainable development problems that inhibit the usage levels required to facilitate successful implementations. This paper explores the successful implementation from a Bangladesh perspective. In particular, it identifies the possible applications of Blockchain in project procurement and management, and it develops a guideline for incorporating Blockchain into project management to improve the existing project and the procurement management practices in developing countries. This is a qualitative study with an interpretivist research methodology. By adopting an interpretive approach, this study construes knowledge as that only gained through social constructions, such as language, shared meanings, documents, industry reports, reviews of academic papers, and tools; it is a changing and relative phenomenon. This study reveals that developing countries are suffering in terms of the development of projects, including poor project management, a lack of transparency, poor procurement management, etc. A total of 38 issues were identified through this study, which are the main barriers to the successful implementation of public sector projects. One of the main reasons is due to the practice of awarding the lowest bidder during the procurement process due to the current regulatory requirements. This paper found that the Oracle platform, built on Blockchain technology as a cloud-computing platform, is one of the prominent E-procurement platforms that provides both the Blockchain platform and the cloud-based applications. Therefore, after observing and analysing the platform, it is found that Blockchain technology has the capability to resolve 25 issues out of 38 identified issues.	blockchain technology;application interface;e-procurement;procurement management;project management
1685	技术治理	Emotional Artificial Neural Networks and Gaussian Process-Regression-Based Hybrid Machine-Learning Model for Prediction of Security and Privacy Effects on M-Banking Attractiveness	With recent advances in mobile and internet technologies, the digital payment market is an increasingly integral part of people's lives, offering many useful and interesting services, e.g., m-banking and cryptocurrency. The m-banking system allows users to pay for goods, services, and earn money via cryptotrading using any device such as mobile phones from anywhere. With the recent trends in global digital markets, especially the cryptocurrency market, m-banking is projected to have a brighter future. However, information stored or conveyed via these channels is more vulnerable to different security threats. Thus, the aim of this study is to examine the influence of security and confidentiality on m-banking patronage using artificial intelligence ensemble methods (ANFIS, GPR, EANN, and BRT) for the prediction of safety and secrecy effects. AI models were trained and tested using 745 datasets obtained from the study areas. The results indicated that AI models predicted the influence of security with high precision (NSE > 0.95), with the GPR model outperformed the other models. The results indicated that security and privacy were key influential parameters of m-payment system patronage (m-banking), followed by service and interface qualities. Unlike previous m-banking studies, the study results showed ease of use and culture to have no influence on m-banking patronage. These study results would assist m-payment system stakeholders, while the approach may serve as motivation for researchers to use AI techniques. The study also provides directions for future m-banking studies.	m-banking;security;artificial intelligence;ensemble techniques;machine learning;privacymobile banking;impact;acceptance;intention;trust
1686	技术治理	Time-travel Investigation: Toward Building a Scalable Attack Detection Framework on Ethereum	Ethereum has been attracting lots of attacks, hence there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. However, existing systems suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage. In this article, we propose a scalable attack detection framework named EthS cope, which overcomes the scalability issue by neatly re-organizing the Ethereum state and efficiently locating suspicious transactions. It leverages the fine-grained state to support the replay of arbitrary transactions and proposes a well-designed schema to optimize the storage consumption. The performance evaluation shows that EthScope can solve the scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a large-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of around 2,300x when replaying transactions. It also has lower storage consumption compared with existing systems. Further analysis shows that EthScope can help analysts understand attack behaviors and detect more attack instances.	ethereum;attack detection;vulnerability

Various research approaches emerge from different scholarly backgrounds, but the interrelation of research areas and current trends has not been adequately considered in a systematic review. We employ a data-driven content analysis approach to examine previous research on blockchain technology in operations management and supply chain management. We investigate the extent to which blockchain technology was considered in scholarly works, structure the research efforts, and identify trends, interrelated themes, and promising research opportunities. Quantitative and qualitative content analysis is conducted on an extensive literature sample of 410 articles. Results indicate an optimistic attitude due to potentials such as tracking and tracing abilities, efficiency increases, and trust-building. Conceptual studies dominate the literature set, with increasing qualitative research efforts. Grand theories are seldomly addressed in the studies. Blockchain technology is outlined as particularly useful when combined with other technologies like IoT. We also identified sustainability implications of the technology, such as enabling transparency for SC stakeholders. Cryptocurrencies can facilitate further efficiency gains if legal uncertainties are reduced. The study is concluded with managerial and theoretical implications and future research opportunities.	blockchain technology;operations management;supply chain management;content analysis;systematic literature reviewindustry 4.0;logistics;information;internet;implementation;traceability;framework;system;things;roles
1688	实体经济	A Review of Digital Transformation on Supply Chain Process Management Using Text Mining	Industry 4.0 technologies are causing a paradigm shift in supply chain process management. The digital transformation of the supply chains provides enormous benefits to organizations by empowering collaboration among multiple internal and external organizations and systems.

1689	协同技术	Blockchain for IoT access control: Recent trends and future research directions	With the rapid development of wireless sensor networks, smart devices, and traditional information and communication technologies, there is tremendous growth in the use of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services in our everyday life. IoT systems deal with high volumes of data. This data can be particularly sensitive, as it may include health, financial, location, and other personal information. Therefore, fine-grained security management in IoT demands effective access control. Several proposals discuss access control for the IoT. However, a limited focus is given to the emerging blockchain-based solutions for IoT access control. In this paper, we review the recent trends and critical needs for blockchain-based solutions for IoT access control. We identify several important aspects of blockchain, including decentralised control, secure storage and sharing information in a trustless manner for IoT access control, including their benefits and limitations. Finally, we note some future research directions on converging blockchain in IoT access control efficiently and effectively.	internet of things;blockchain;access control;identity;security;trustthings security;internet;challenges;delegation;lightweight;issues;trust
1690	市场治理	Impacts of COVID-19 on the Return and Volatility Nexus among Cryptocurrency Market	The impacts of COVID-19 have spread rapidly to global financial markets. In this context, combining the spillover index method introduced by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and the complex network analysis framework, we examined the volatility connectedness and the topological structure among the top ten cryptocurrencies before and during the COVID-19 crisis. The results revealed that the total volatility connectedness of the cryptocurrency market markedly increased following the outbreak of COVID-19; statically, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Bitcoin Cash were the net transmitters before COVID-19, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Cardano, and Stellar became the major net transmitters in the market after COVID-19. Dynamically, the dynamic performance of different cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 pandemic was heterogeneous, and the possible driving factors are diverse. Moreover, from network analysis, we further found that the COVID-19 crisis has significantly changed the topological structure of the cryptocurrency market. Our findings may help understand the typical dynamics in the cryptocurrency market and provide significant implications for portfolio managers, investors, and government agencies in times of highly stressful events like the COVID-19 crisis.	cross-correlations;systemic risk;connectedness;bitcoin;spillovers;contagion

After Covid-19 appeared, the momentum effect and reversal effect disappeared. The advent of bitcoin futures has increased how investors respond to information. With the outbreak of COVID-19, investor interest in Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset has increased the effectiveness of the price. We estimate the speed of signal diffusion in the bitcoin market, and the results support that effective response to information is the essential mechanism for the disappearance of momentum effect.	momentum effect;overreaction;underreaction;bitcoin market;bitcoin futuresreturns;cryptocurrencies

In this paper, we present a simple cross-country analysis drawing on recently released survey-based data. We explore the correlation of crypto-asset usage with indicators of corruption, capital controls, a history of high inflation, and other factors. We find that crypto-asset usage is significantly and positively associated with corruption and capital controls. Notwithstanding the data limitations, the results support the case for regulating crypto-assets, including know-your-customer approaches, as opposed to taking a laissez-faire stance.

1693	实体经济	Research on Resource Carbon Emission Allocation Efficiency Based on Blockchain Consensus Algorithm	This paper takes the secondary low-carbon supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer as the research object and takes the government subsidy strategy of low-carbon supply chain as the research theme, the government invests in the construction of blockchain technology application platform, and supply chain enterprises use blockchain technology for compensation. Under this background, considering consumers' low-carbon preference and green trust, a three-stage game model dominated by the government and followed by manufacturers and retailers under the four scenarios of emission reduction technology input subsidy and low-carbon product output subsidy before and after the application of blockchain technology is established. By comparing the optimal social welfare, carbon emission reduction rate, and low-carbon product output under the four scenarios, the optimal problem of government low-carbon subsidy strategy is discussed. It is found that when the product of consumers' low-carbon preference coefficient and green trust coefficient is greater than a certain fixed value, the government can obtain higher social welfare and promote enterprises' emission reduction through output subsidies. The government can always promote the demand for low-carbon products through output subsidies. When the emission reduction cost coefficient approaches infinity, the demand for low-carbon products when the government implements output subsidies are four times that when the government implements technology subsidies. When the single cycle shared cost of the blockchain platform and the unit cost of enterprise application of blockchain technology are less than a certain threshold, the government's construction of the blockchain platform can obtain higher social welfare, promote enterprise emission reduction, and improve consumers' demand for low-carbon products.	
1694	协同技术	Blockchain-Enabled: Multi-Layered Security Federated Learning Platform for Preserving Data Privacy	Privacy and data security have become the new hot topic for regulators in recent years. As a result, Federated Learning (FL) (also called collaborative learning) has emerged as a new training paradigm that allows multiple, geographically distributed nodes to learn a Deep Learning (DL) model together without sharing their data. Blockchain is becoming a new trend as data protection and privacy are concerns in many sectors. Technology is leading the world and transforming into a global village where everything is accessible and transparent. We have presented a blockchain enabled security model using FL that can generate an enhanced DL model without sharing data and improve privacy through higher security and access rights to data. However, existing FL approaches also have unique security vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit and compromise the trained model. The FL method is compared to the other known approaches. Users are more likely to choose the latter option, i.e., providing local but private data to the server and using ML apps, performing ML operations on the devices without benefiting from other users' data, and preventing direct access to raw data and local training of ML models. FL protects data privacy and reduces data transfer overhead by storing raw data on devices and combining locally computed model updates. We have investigated the feasibility of data and model poisoning attacks under a blockchain-enabled FL system built alongside the Ethereum network and the traditional FL system (without blockchain). This work fills a knowledge gap by proposing a transparent incentive mechanism that can encourage good behavior among participating decentralized nodes and avoid common problems and provides knowledge for the FL security literature by investigating current FL systems.	federated learning (fl);blockchain;zero-knowledge proofs (zkps);multi-layer security;poisoning attacks;convolutional neural network (cnn)
1695	虚拟经济	The Blockchain Technology Applied in the Development of Real Economy in Jiangsu under Deep Learning	This study focuses on the financing difficulties of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in China to study the application of blockchain technology in developing the real economy. Deep learning neural network is applied to the vulnerability analysis and detection of smart contracts in blockchain technology by analyzing the connotation of blockchain technology and deep learning. A multiparty joint financial service platform based on blockchain technology is established to help SMEs financing institutions reduce transaction costs, thereby helping them reduce loan interest rates. Finally, Jiangsu Province is studied as a pilot unit. The results show that the Recall and F-score of Bidirectional Neural Network for smart contract vulnerability detection are higher than those of the original neural network. The Recall rate and F-score value of the Wide and Deep model are up to 96.2% and 94.7%, which are higher than those of other vulnerability detection schemes. The Timestamp vulnerability has the highest Recall rate, 94.2%, which can rely on a large amount of valid data to improve detection efficiency. The distribution of financing needs of SMEs in Jiangsu Province from 2020 to 2021 shows that the loan number of SMEs is generally not high. Still, financial institutions and enterprises must spend the same transaction cost. After a technology company in Nanjing made a loan through a blockchain financial service platform, its financing cost decreased by 0.5331%. Blockchain technology has played a great role in the financing process of SMEs, reducing intermediate links and credit costs, and promoting the development of SMEs and the real economy.	challenges
1696	技术治理	Identification of End-User Economical Relationship Graph Using Lightweight Blockchain-Based BERT Model	Current methods for extracting information from user resumes do not work well with unstructured user resumes in economic announcements, and they do not work well with documents that have the same users in them. Unstructured user information is turned into structured user information templates in this study. It also proposes a way to build person relationship graphs in the field of economics. First, the lightweight blockchain-based BERT model (B-BERT) is trained. The learned B-BERT pretraining model is then utilized to get the event instance vector, categorize it appropriately, and populate the hierarchical user information templates with accurate user characteristics. The aim of this research is that it has investigated the approach of creating character connection graphs in the Chinese financial system and suggests a framework for doing so in the economic sector. Furthermore, the relationship between users is found through the filled-in user information template, and a graph of user relationships is made. This is how it works: finally, the experiment is checked by filling in a manually annotated dataset. In tests, the method can be used to get text information from unstructured economic user resumes and build a relationship map of people in the financial field. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of efficiently retrieving information from unstructured financial personnel resume text and generating a character relationship graph in the economic sphere.	
1697	市场治理	An interpretable decision-support systems for daily cryptocurrency trading	Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin (BTC), have become an important commodity for both individual and corporate investors within the last decade. The limited supply, high volatility, and random price fluctuations have increased investors' interest in BTC, especially in daily trading. Although BTC has been yielding a high rate of returns, price fluctuations and constant speculations make the investors wary of unexpected price movements. Predictive modeling suffers from the complexity of the datasets (i.e., the high number of features employed to forecast BTC movements) as well as the black-box nature of most machine learning algorithms (which is especially problematic for corporate investors since they are obligated to disclose their investment decisions to their clients). Therefore, the main goal of the current study is to assist individual and corporate investors in making transparent and interpretable daily BTC trading decisions by developing a predictive analytics framework. To address the complexities posed by the datasets, a comprehensive tri-level feature selection approach is proposed. The selected features are then, fed into the Classification & Regression Tree (C&RT) to build a highly parsimonious, transparent, and interpretable prediction model. The resultant model was not only evaluated on the test (holdout) sample but was also tested on challenging time periods, including the first half of 2020 (the start of the pandemic era) to exhibit the viability and reliability of the proposed framework. Finally, a decision support tool is developed for the practical implementation of the model. The tool can be used by short-term investors not only due to its highly simplistic, transparent, and interpretable structure, but also its higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity results when compared to the extant literature.	cryptocurrency;bitcoin;price prediction;predictive analytics;machine learning;c &amp;rt;decision support systemsprediction;prices
1698	核心技术	Why Do Smart Contracts Self-Destruct? Investigating the Selfdestruct Function on Ethereum	The selfdestruct function is provided by Ethereum smart contracts to destroy a contract on the blockchain system. However, it is a double-edged sword for developers. On the one hand, using the selfdestruct function enables developers to remove smart contracts (SCs) from Ethereum and transfers Ethers when emergency situations happen, e.g., being attacked. On the other hand, this function can increase the complexity for the development and open an attack vector for attackers. To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or exclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online survey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their feedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to the Ethereum after destructing the old contract. According to this information, we propose a method to find the self-destructed contracts (also called predecessor contracts) and their updated version (successor contracts) by computing the code similarity. By analyzing the difference between the predecessor contracts and their successor contracts, we found five reasons that led to the death of the contracts; two of them (i.e., Unmatched ERC20 Token and Limits of Permission) might affect the life span of contracts. We developed a tool named LIFESCOPE to detect these problems. LifeScope reports 0 false positives or negatives in detecting UNMATCHED ERC20 Token. In terms of Limits of Permission, LIFESCOPE achieves 77.89% of F-measure and 0.8673 of AUC in average. According to the feedback of developers who exclude selfdestruct functions, we propose suggestions to help developers use selfdestruct functions in Ethereum smart contracts better.	smart contract;ethereum;selfdestruct function;empirical study
1699	核心技术	SRE_BBC: A Self-Adaptive Security Enabled Requirements Engineering Approach for SLA Smart Contracts in Blockchain-Based Cloud Systems	Current blockchain-based cloud (BBC) systems have several security vulnerabilities regarding smart contracts (SC), and several attacks have been reported recently. The SC development lacks standard design processes that follow software lifecycle principles to model secure SC. Secondly, the security mechanisms in the SC are not constantly evolved to resist evolving adversary attacks. BBC systems lack self-adaptive security capability to make spontaneous decisions when adversarial attacks are encountered. To build a self-adaptive secure BBC system that follows standard software development lifecycle principles to model secure SC, we propose the so-called self-adaptive security RE_BBC framework. The framework would utilize the MAPE-BBC adaptation loop to make decisions internally based on the threat models, goal models, and service level agreement (SLA) SC security specifications. The framework identifies vulnerabilities and threats and takes precautionary measures using self-adaptive SC agents. We validated the proposed methodology theoretically and empirically, and statistically proved the research questions and hypothesis using the t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Subsequently, we compare our proposed approach with the Security Quality Requirements Engineering approach (SQUARE). The feasibility results and the replicated study results indicate that the proposed approach outperformed the SQUARE approach in terms of artifacts quality, self-adaptive security evaluation quality, efficiency in response time, complexity, and usefulness of the proposed approach for the Healthcare Data Management (HDM) system. SC security developers can immensely benefit from our proposed methodology. They need not reengineer SC from scratch; depending on their security needs and plan, the contract can be adapted to execute a new plan.	security;attacks;vulnerabilities;goal model;threat model;self-adaptation;sla;smart contract;blockchain;cloud;healthcare
1700	实体经济	An Idealized Clinicogenomic Registry to Engage Underrepresented Populations Using Innovative Technology	Current best practices in tumor registries provide a glimpse into a limited time frame over the natural history of disease, usually a narrow window around diagnosis and biopsy. This creates challenges meeting public health and healthcare reimbursement policies that increasingly require robust documentation of long-term clinical trajectories, quality of life, and health economics outcomes. These challenges are amplified for underrepresented minority (URM) and other disadvantaged populations, who tend to view the institution of clinical research with skepticism. Participation gaps leave such populations underrepresented in clinical research and, importantly, in policy decisions about treatment choices and reimbursement, thus further augmenting health, social, and economic disparities. Cloud computing, mobile computing, digital ledgers, tokenization, and artificial intelligence technologies are powerful tools that promise to enhance longitudinal patient engagement across the natural history of disease. These tools also promise to enhance engagement by giving participants agency over their data and addressing a major impediment to research participation. This will only occur if these tools are available for use with all patients. Distributed ledger technologies (specifically blockchain) converge these tools and offer a significant element of trust that can be used to engage URM populations more substantively in clinical research. This is a crucial step toward linking composite cohorts for training and optimization of the artificial intelligence tools for enhancing public health in the future. The parameters of an idealized clinical genomic registry are presented.	genomic;registry;chronic disease;health disparity;electronic medical record;cancerreal-world evidence;precision medicine;health-care;clinical-outcomes;external controls;genomic medicine;informed-consent;cancer;participation;diversity
1701	实体经济	Artificial Intelligence-based Blockchain Technology for Skin Cancer Investigation Complemented with Dietary Assessment and Recommendation using Correlation Analysis in Elder Individuals	In the modern world, due to the usage of high-power chemical-based cosmetics, climate change, and other major factors, skin cancer has been increasing among individuals. Skin cancer is considered as the most common malignant disorder, and there are more than a million cases being recorded with this disease every year. Extensive studies have already been performed to identify the risk factors and causative agents for skin cancer, including lifestyle changes and eatery patterns among individuals. The most common type of skin cancer is classified into basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The researcher intends to conduct the research with the primary goal of determining the important factors in blockchain technology in the treatment of skin cancer in senior people. The application of new technologies such as blockchain has enabled offering better promises to health care professionals in addressing skin cancer in a more effective manner. These tools supported in evaluating the nature and severity of psoriasis has been regarded as much support for health care professionals in detecting skin cancer and offer better health care guidance for better living. The detection of melanomas supports the patient in enhancing the prognosis and support in discriminating between the melanomas and less impact lesions. The blockchain-based classification system offers more benefits and reduces the cost of detecting skin cancer in an effective manner. It also helps the medical professionals by assisting them in developing a custom diet plan for each patient on the basis of their health records and food intake. The researchers are focused on applying both the primary data sources and secondary data sources for performing the study. A detailed questionnaire is designed, and it is shared with the participants through university hospitals, support groups, etc. so as to gather the information. Nearly 156 respondents were chosen through nonprobability sampling, and the information was collected. The researcher performs critical descriptive analysis, and correlation analysis is performed to understand the overall association between the variables. The researchers intend to perform the study with the basic goal of understanding the critical factors in blockchain technology in skin cancer for elderly individuals. The major factors involved are enhanced data privacy, support in forecasting patterns, and enhanced medical services to patients complemented with personalized dietary assessment and recommendations. The result demonstrates that artificial intelligence-based blockchain technology allows for the efficient processing of huge amounts of data in order to complete the assigned task and correctly determine and predict the model.	
1702	实体经济	On the Internet of Things, Blockchain Technology for Supply Chain Management (IoT)	Patient's medical records are now accessible from anywhere and at any time, thanks to the Internet and the changes it has wrought in the healthcare industry. Electronic health records were dogged by a lack of standards, but that was not the only issue. Decentralized online ledgers were already being proposed and used to solve interoperability and privacy issues when blockchain-based systems were first built. As far as technical issues go, scaling, usability, and accessibility stand out. On the one hand, it is difficult to keep secure access control measures on-chain while simultaneously keeping a wide range of medical data off-chain. Finding out who owns what and spreading access control of data is the second challenge in medical settings. Using temporal blockchain, the Secured Healthcare System (SHS) aims to address these problems (TB). As an SHS fundamental building piece, the context-based Merkle tree emphasizes privacy, enhanced integrity management, and access control methods (CBMT). For interoperability and scale control, the framework uses temporal features, HL7 criteria, and IPFS data management (IPFS). Personalized micro booklet (PML) security was found to be affected by the SHS framework, namely, on the time-based shadow notions and the contextual components of the PML (PML). Taking advantage of the architecture's enormous potential to solve the challenges of siloed data and enabling tamperproof, secure healthcare transaction has been sought.	
1703	实体经济	Blockchain technology in healthcare: A systematic review	Blockchain technology (BCT) has emerged in the last decade and added a lot of interest in the healthcare sector. The purpose of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to explore the potential paradigm shift in healthcare utilizing BCT. The study is compiled by reviewing research articles published in nine well-reputed venues such as IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Springs Link, Scopus, Taylor & Francis, Science Direct, PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, and MDPI between January 2016 to August 2021. A total of 1,192 research studies were identified out of which 51 articles were selected based on inclusion criteria for this SLR that presents the modern information on the recent implications and gaps in the use of BCT for enhancing the healthcare procedures. According to the outcomes, BCT is being applied to design the novel and advanced interventions to enrich the current protocol of managing, distributing, and processing clinical records and personal medical information. BCT is enduring the conceptual development in the healthcare domain, where it has summed up the substantial elements through better and enhanced efficiency, technological innovation, access control, data privacy, and security. A framework is developed to address the probable field where future researchers can add considerable value, such as data protection, system architecture, and regulatory compliance. Finally, this SLR concludes that the upcoming research can support the pervasive implementation of BCT to address the critical dilemmas related to health diagnostics, enhancing the patient healthcare process in remote monitoring or emergencies, data integrity, and avoiding fraud.	framework;challenges;privacy;ledger;opportunities;management;scheme
1704	协同技术	IoT-Gov: an IoT governance framework using the blockchain	Internet of Things (IoT) has become an essential technology in different daily life domains including health, industry and finance among many others. The implementation of IoT systems requires different underlying technologies such as applications, network infrastructures, and different needs in terms of functionality, security, etc. The success of an IoT project is therefore a challenging task requiring a good governance where different IoT standards and tools can be synchronized and will coordinate with each other in a way every" thing" agrees upon. In this paper, we demonstrate that existing governance frameworks are not sufficient in the IoT context. Therefore, and after identifying the IoT governance requirements, we suggest a new IoT governance framework, IoT-Gov, with its proposed architecture for IoT systems and its methodological approach allowing, through a set of defined processes and algorithms, to progressively build the desired IoT system. IoT-Gov, is a new framework for modeling governance process in IoT through three layers that are: strategic objectives, Design and modeling, and Implementation. A technical conception of the proposed framework is provided using the blockchain, a technology allowing decentralization, transparence and enhancing security. To prove the feasibility of our framework, we investigate a smart parking system using constrained devices, as an example of an IoT ecosystem, and justify the suggested governance model applied to it. This model is enforced with the attribute based access control model and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Tests of the proposed governance model are provided. Performance results show the efficiency of this framework as well as its applicability in an IoT context.	governance;iot;security;blockchain;access control;abac;smart parkingaccess-control;internet;things;technology;challenges;adoption;devices
1705	协同技术	A Scalable Blockchain-Based Integrity Verification Scheme	Ensuring the integrity of remote data is the prerequisite for implementing cloud-edge computing. Traditional data integrity verification schemes make users spend a lot of time regularly checking their data, which is not suitable for large-scale IoT (Internet of Things) data. On the other hand, the introduction of a third-party auditor (TPA) may bring about greater privacy and security issues. We use blockchain to address the problem of TPA. However, implementing dynamic integrity verification with blockchain is a bigger challenge due to the low throughput and poor scalability of blockchain. More importantly, whether there is a security problem with blockchain-based integrity verification is not yet known. In this paper, we propose a scalable blockchain-based integrity verification scheme that implements fully dynamic operations and blockless verification. The scheme builds scalable homomorphic verification tags based on ZSS (Zhang-Safavi-Susilo) short signatures. We exploit smart contract technology to replace TPA for integrity verification tasks, which not only eliminates the risk of privacy leakage but also resists collusion attacks. Furthermore, we formally define a blockchain-based security model and prove that our scheme is secure under the security assumption of cryptographic primitives. Finally, the mathematical analysis of our scheme shows that both the communication complexity and the communication complexity of an audit are O eth c THORN , in which c is the number of challenge blocks. We compare our scheme with other schemes, and the results show that our scheme has the lowest time consumption to complete an audit.

Furthermore, we analyze the state-of-the-art BC works in the medical area, assessing their benefits-drawbacks, and guiding future researchers to overcome the limitations of the existing articles.	blockchain;iot;healthcare;ehr challenge;medical areahealth;internet
1707	实体经济	Investigation into the Reliability and Encryption Performance of Wireless Signal Transmission by Network Coding Combined with Blockchain in Natural Disaster Scenarios	To enhance the reliability and encryption of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless signals in natural disaster scenarios, firstly, the present work analyzes the current wireless signal transmission mode of UAV. In addition, it discusses the efficient network coding of wireless signal transmission model and blockchain with strong encryption ability. Secondly, the signal transmission model of network coding is explored. Finally, the network coding wireless signal transmission model is combined with the blockchain wireless signal transmission model to realize efficient and encrypted data transmission. The research results show that the network coding wireless signal transmission model combined with blockchain technology realizes the maximum difference of network coding wireless signal transmission rate of 1.5 Mb/s. The model also encrypts the data in the simulation scenario of natural disasters through blockchain technology. After encryption, the data protection effect of the transmission model is significantly improved and meets the requirements of standard data transmission. Meanwhile, the wireless signal transmission model can reduce the resource occupation rate in the process of data transmission and improve the success rate and universality of data transmission in natural disaster scenarios. The probability of data being successfully protected in disaster is more than 90%. The results provide technical support for the stable transmission of wireless signals in natural disaster scenarios and provide a reference for improving the reliability and encryption of wireless signal transmission.	technology;protocol
1708	市场治理	The impact of COVID-19 on cryptocurrency markets: A network analysis based on mutual information	The purpose of our study is to figure out the transitions of the cryptocurrency market due to the outbreak of COVID-19 through network analysis, and we studied the complexity of the market from different perspectives. To construct a cryptocurrency network, we first apply a mutual information method to the daily log return values of 102 digital currencies from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020, and also apply a correlation coefficient method for comparison. Based on these two methods, we construct networks by applying the minimum spanning tree and the planar maximally filtered graph. Furthermore, we study the statistical and topological properties of these networks. Numerical results demonstrate that the degree distribution follows the power-law and the graphs after the COVID-19 outbreak have noticeable differences in network measurements compared to before. Moreover, the results of graphs constructed by each method are different in topological and statistical properties and the network's behavior. In particular, during the post-COVID-19 period, it can be seen that Ethereum and Qtum are the most influential cryptocurrencies in both methods. Our results provide insight and expectations for investors in terms of sharing information about cryptocurrencies amid the uncertainty posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.	power-law distributions;bitcoin;exchange;nexus
1709	市场治理	The Role of Crypto Trading in the Economy, Renewable Energy Consumption and Ecological Degradation	The rapid growth of information technology and industrial revolutions provoked digital transformation of all sectors, from the government to households. Moreover, digital transformations led to the development of cryptocurrency. However, crypto trading provokes a dilemma loop. On the one hand, crypto trading led to economic development, which allowed attracting additional resources to extending smart and green technologies for de-carbonising the economic growth. On the other hand, crypto trading led to intensifying energy sources, which provoked an increase in greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. The paper aims to analyse the connections between crypto trading, economic development of the country, renewable energy consumption, and environmental degradation. The data for analysis were obtained from: Our World in Data, World Data Bank, Eurostat, Ukrstat, Crystal Blockchain, and KOF Globalisation Index. To check the hypothesis, the paper applied the Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests, FMOLS and DOLS panel cointegration models, and Vector Error Correction Models. The findings concluded that the increasing crypto trading led to enhanced GDP, real gross fixed capital formation, and globalisation. However, in the long run, the relationship between crypto trading and the share of renewable energies in total energy consumption was not confirmed by the empirical results. For further directions, it is necessary to analyse the impact of crypto trading on land and water pollution.	bitcoin;crypto market;cryptocurrency;trading;digital currency;innovation;ecological degradation;economic growthbitcoin;cointegration;issues;system;poland
1710	市场治理	Generative Adversarial Network to evaluate quantity of information in financial markets	Nowadays, the information obtainable from the markets are potentially limitless. Economic theory has always supported the possible advantage obtainable from having more information than competitors, however quantifying the advantage that these can give has always been a problem. In particular, in this paper we study the amount of information obtainable from the markets taking into account only the time series of the prices, through the use of a specific Generative Adversarial Network. We consider two types of financial instruments traded on the market, stocks and cryptocurrencies: the first are traded in a market subject to opening and closing hours, whereas cryptocurrencies are traded in a 24/7 market. Our goal is to use this GAN to be able to "convert" the amount of information that the different instruments can have in discriminative and predictive power, useful to improve forecast. Finally, we demonstrate that by using the initial dataset with the 5 most important feature useds by traders, the prices of cryptocurrencies present higher discriminatory and predictive power than stocks, while by adding a feature the situation can be completely reversed.	generative adversarial network;deep learning applications;market information analysis;stock price analysisefficient capital-markets;annual-report readability;time-series;disclosure quality;current earnings;price discovery;long-term;prediction;enhance;level
1711	技术治理	A Study on Blockchain Architecture Design Decisions and Their Security Attacks and Threats	Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing a central authentication/verification authority. Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE's attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems. Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure implementations.	blockchain;security threat classification;architecture decision;design decisionsauthentication;internet;system;challenges;things

Key pair encryption and private key signing have been defined mainly for human identification in blockchain applications, where users are personally and responsibly concerned about the confidentiality of their private key. These methods are not suitable for computing nodes whose private key is implemented in the software they run. Ensuring that transactions are issued by a legitimate sender with the proper credentials is a bigger concern in applications with financial stakes. This is the case with blockchain energy trading platforms, where prosumers are credited with tokens in exchange for their contributions of energy. The tokens are issued by smart meter nodes installed at fixed locations to monitor the energy inputs and outputs of a given prosumer and claim energy tokens on its behalf from a defined smart contract in exchange for the energy it feeds into the grid. To this end, we have developed a decentralized Proof-of-Location (PoL) system tailored to blockchain applications for energy trading. It ensures that automated transactions are issued by the right nodes by using smart contract-based random selection and a game-theoretic scenario suitable for blockchain energy trading.	blockchain;energy trading;game theory;proof of location;random selectionprivacy;challenges;services
1713	虚拟经济	A Novel Bitcoin and Gold Prices Prediction Method Using an LSTM-P Neural Network Model	As a result of the fast growth of financial technology and artificial intelligence around the world, quantitative algorithms are now being employed in many classic futures and stock trading, as well as hot digital currency trades, among other applications today. Using the historical price series of Bitcoin and gold from 9/11/2016 to 9/10/2021, we investigate an LSTM-P neural network model for predicting the values of Bitcoin and gold in this research. We first employ a noise reduction approach based on the wavelet transform to smooth the fluctuations of the price data, which has been shown to increase the accuracy of subsequent predictions. Second, we apply a wavelet transform to diminish the influence of high-frequency noise components on prices. Third, in the price prediction model, we develop an optimized LSTM prediction model (LSPM-P) and train it using historical price data for gold and Bitcoin to make accurate predictions. As a consequence of our model, we have a high degree of accuracy when projecting future pricing. In addition, our LSTM-P model outperforms both the conventional LSTM models and other time series forecasting models in terms of accuracy and precision.	
1714	虚拟经济	Is Bitcoin's Carbon Footprint Persistent? Multifractal Evidence and Policy Implications	The Bitcoin mining process is energy intensive, which can hamper the much-desired ecological balance. Given that the persistence of high levels of energy consumption of Bitcoin could have permanent policy implications, we examine the presence of long memory in the daily data of the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BECI) (BECI upper bound, BECI lower bound, and BECI average) covering the period 25 February 2017 to 25 January 2022. Employing fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) models to estimate the order of fractional integrating parameter and compute the Hurst exponent, which measures long memory, this study shows that distant series observations are strongly autocorrelated and long memory exists in most cases, although mean-reversion is observed at the first difference of the data series. Such evidence for the profound presence of long memory suggests the suitability of applying permanent policies regarding the use of alternate energy for mining; otherwise, transitory policy would quickly become obsolete. We also suggest the replacement of 'proof-of-work' with 'proof-of-space' or 'proof-of-stake', although with a trade-off (possible security breach) to reduce the carbon footprint, the implementation of direct tax on mining volume, or the mandatory use of carbon credits to restrict the environmental damage.	bitcoin carbon footprint;bitcoin mining;energy consumption;figarch;mfdfa;long memory;hurst exponent;permanent policyhurst exponent;power

Realizing this grand vision requires a significantly enhanced vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network that should be extremely intelligent and capable of concurrently supporting hyperfast, ultrareliable, and low-latency massive information exchange. It is anticipated that the sixth-generation (6G) communication systems will fulfill these requirements of the next-generation V2X.

1716	实体经济	A Comprehensive Survey on the Applications of Blockchain for Securing Vehicular Networks	Vehicular networks promise features such as traffic management, route scheduling, data exchange, entertainment, and much more. With any large-scale technological integration comes the challenge of providing security. Blockchain technology has been a popular choice of many studies for making the vehicular network more secure. Its characteristics meet some of the essential security requirements such as decentralization, transparency, tamper-proof nature, and public audit. This study catalogues some of the notable efforts in this direction over the last few years. We analyze around 75 blockchain-based security schemes for vehicular networks from an application, security, and blockchain perspective. The application perspective focuses on various applications which use secure blockchain-based vehicular networks such as transportation, parking, data sharing/ trading, and resource sharing. The security perspective focuses on security requirements and attacks. The blockchain perspective focuses on blockchain platforms, blockchain types, and consensus mechanisms used in blockchain implementation. We also compile the popular simulation tools used for simulating blockchain and for simulating vehicular networks. Additionally, to give the readers a broader perspective of the research area, we discuss the role of various state-of-the-art emerging technologies in blockchain-based vehicular networks. Finally, we summarize the survey by listing out some common challenges and future research directions in this field.	blockchains;security;vehicular ad hoc networks;entertainment industry;accidents;smart cities;road safety;internet of things (iot);blockchain;internet of vehicles (iov);security;cryptography;authenticationdischarging trading scheme;named data networking;authentication scheme;enabled internet;consortium blockchain;batch verification;trust management;electric vehicle;key management;privacy
1717	实体经济	On-site safety inspection of tower cranes: A blockchain-enabled conceptual framework	The on-site safety inspection is an essential procedure to ensure tower cranes' safety in the usage stage by finding equipment defects (e.g., loose bolts) and potential environmental hazards (e.g., poor ground conditions) in advance. However, the following two issues should be tackled to secure its effectiveness: (1) how to guarantee the execution of safety inspections, especially under a tight construction schedule? and (2) how to ensure the inspection information is immutable, transparent, and traceable?This research, guided by the design science approach, aimed to develop a blockchain-enabled framework for assuring the effectiveness of on-site safety inspection of tower cranes (OSITC). First, a literature review was conducted to identify OSITC challenges and blockchain potential. Then, a blockchain-based conceptual frame-work was provided, with two major components: smart contracts and the consensus process, being discussed. Finally, using the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, a prototype system was developed to instantiate and test the proposed framework. The findings suggest that the blockchain can protect the OSITC's effectiveness by allowing safety inspections to be automatically executed via smart contracts and providing relevant stakeholders with trustworthy inspection records via consensus algorithms. This study provides a novel solution for tower crane safety management to construction researchers and practitioners, inspiring more discussions about blockchain technology.	construction safety management;tower crane safety;safety inspection;blockchain;smart contractconstruction-industry;design science;system;technology;management;platform;internet;uav

The datasets used in this study are the actual closing prices and transaction volumes of 9 different cryptocurrencies, from the earliest time obtainable in Yahoo! Finance, all the way to 31 Oct 2021. Firstly, this paper presents a study of the severe drawbacks of all existing literature on FTS. In particular, this article outlines severe shortcomings of all existing FTS based algorithms that caused inaccuracies among all existing FTS-based algorithms in yielding meaningful prediction. Then, a novel structure of our improvised FTS, denoted as QFTS, is presented in this paper, which aims to rectify all flaws exist in all conventional FTS based models in literature. A further hybrid of QFTS with ANN is also presented. Later, a comparative analysis of all the aforementioned FTS models is presented in terms of overall forecasting accuracy and forecasting accuracy under specific conditions. The results are being compared in terms of MAPE. The newly invented QFTS model and the QFTS-ANN hybrid is found to profoundly outperform all the existing FTS models in literature, which includes Singh's FTS model. Such innovation profoundly rectifies severe shortcomings in financial forecasting that have persisted for many years in the past literature. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Inc.

1719	市场治理	Investigating the informativeness of technical indicators and news sentiment in financial market price prediction	Real-time market prediction tool tracking public opinion in specialized newsgroups and informative market data persuades investors of financial markets. Previous works mainly used lexicon-based sentiment analysis for financial markets prediction, while recently proposed transformer-based sentiment analysis promise good results for cross-domain sentiment analysis. This work considers temporal relationships between consecutive snapshots of informative market data and mood time series for market price prediction. We calculate the sentiment mood time series via the probability distribution of news embedding generated through a BERT-based transformer language model fine-tuned for financial domain sentiment analysis. We then use a deep recurrent neural network for feature extraction followed by a dense layer for price regression. We implemented our approach as an open-source API for real-time price regression. We build a corpus of financial news related to currency pairs in foreign exchange and Cryptocurrency markets. We further augment our model with informative technical indicators and news sentiment scores aligned based on news release timestamp. Results of our experiments show significant error reduction compared to the baselines.

1720	市场治理	Forecasting cryptocurrency prices using Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short-term Memory	The rapid development of cryptocurrencies over the past decade is one of the most controversial and ambiguous innovations in the modern global economy. Numerous and unpredictable fluctuations in cryptocurrencies rates, as well as the lack of intelligent and proper management of transactions of this type of currency in most developing countries and users of this type of currency, has led to increased risk and distrust of these roses in investors. Capitalists and investors prefer to invest in programs which have the least risk, the most profit and the least time to achieve the main profit. Therefore, the issue of developing appropriate methods and models for predicting the price of cryptographic products is essential both for the scientific community and for financial analysts, investors and traders. In this research, a new deep learning model is used to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. The proposed model uses a Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) method to predict the price. In the presented results of the simulation of the proposed method, factors such as the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), R-Squared (R2) were compared with other similar methods. Finally, the superiority of the proposed method over other methods was proven.	cryptocurrency;recurrent neural network;long short-term memory;deep learning;forecasting prices;time series data
1721	核心技术	Energy Efficient Consensus Approach of Blockchain for IoT Networks with Edge Computing	Blockchain technology is gaining a lot of attention in various fields, such as intellectual property, finance, smart agriculture, etc. The security features of blockchain have been widely used, integrated with artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), software defined networks (SDN), etc. The consensus mechanism of blockchain is its core and ultimately affects the performance of the blockchain. In the past few years, many consensus algorithms, such as proof of work (PoW), ripple, proof of stake (PoS), practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), etc., have been designed to improve the performance of the blockchain. However, the high energy requirement, memory utilization, and processing time do not match with our actual desires. This paper proposes the consensus approach on the basis of PoW, where a single miner is selected for mining the task. The mining task is offloaded to the edge networking. The miner is selected on the basis of the digitization of the specifications of the respective machines. The proposed model makes the consensus approach more energy efficient, utilizes less memory, and less processing time. The improvement in energy consumption is approximately 21% and memory utilization is 24%. Efficiency in the block generation rate at the fixed time intervals of 20 min, 40 min, and 60 min was observed.	blockchain;consensus;energy;edge;offloadingsecure
1722	核心技术	Trusted Electronic Contract for Enabling Peer-to-Peer HPC Resource Sharing	With the growing need for HPC resource usage in Thailand, this study aims to foster the creation of an HPC resource sharing ecosystem based on available in-house computing infrastructure. The model of computing resource sharing based on blockchain technology is presented for bridging communication between multiple clusters of HPC systems. The use of blockchain technology allows states among HPC systems to be synchronized and extends capabilities in enforcing governing rules. A smart contract was deployed on the blockchain network to enable users to request computing resources. Upon a request being made, a matching scheme performs the automatic selection of a suitable cluster based on current cluster utilization data and distance from users. Since users and clusters are anonymized from each other, a trusted payment scheme and permission access control are presented to assure both parties. As the system leverages off-chined and on-chained data exchange to carry out the operation, the secure gateway is proposed to mitigate technical difficulty from the client's perspective and ensure information is securely flowing to and from legitimate actors. The result of this work ensures HPC service providers can maximize the utilization of their resources and monetize idle computing time, while users can access demanded resources conveniently and pay at a reasonable price.	high-performance computing;blockchain;decentralized network
1723	协同技术	B4SDC: A Blockchain System for Security Data Collection in MANETs	Security-related data collection is an essential part for attack detection and security measurement in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). A detection node (i.e., collector) should discover available routes to a collection node for data collection and collect security-related data during route discovery for determining reliable routes. However, few studies provide incentives for security-related data collection in MANETs. In this article, we propose B4SDC, a blockchain system for security-related data collection in MANETs. Through controlling the scale of Route REQuest (RREQ) forwarding in route discovery, the collector can constrain its payment and simultaneously make each forwarder of control information (namely RREQs and Route REPlies, in short RREPs) obtain rewards as much as possible to ensure fairness. At the same time, B4SDC avoids collusion attacks with cooperative receipt reporting, and spoofing attacks by adopting a secure digital signature. Based on a novel Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism by accumulating stakes through message forwarding, B4SDC not only provides incentives for all participating nodes, but also avoids forking and ensures high efficiency and real decentralization. We analyze B4SDC in terms of incentives and security, and evaluate its performance through simulations. The thorough analysis and experimental results show the efficacy and effectiveness of B4SDC.	blockchain;data collection;ad hoc networks;mobile computing;task analysis;bitcoin;manets;security-related data collection;incentive mechanism;blockchainwormhole attacks

It is true that edge computing has been adaptively integrated into growing number of applications. Edge computing theory and technology will bring substantial innovation and incentive, as well as a large number of application scenarios in different fields, such as edge computing assisted smart city, Internet of Vehicles(IoV), Industrial Internet, and many other different fields. In the field of edge computing, however, it is actually lack of a comprehensive investigation of using the most advanced theoretical models, technologies, directions and development paths. To fill this gap, by identifying and classifying, we carry out an in-depth survey of the latest high-quality literatures related to the theoretical discoveries in edge computing(EC) and the fusion of EC and the frontiers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Finally, it is summarized several promising open issues, and also pointed forwards the directions of future research. We hope that this survey report will attract much more attention, stimulate fruitful discussions, and provide ideas and useful guidance for further research on the theoretical models, technologies, directions and development paths of edge computing.	edge computing;5g mobile communication;computational modeling;blockchains;resource management;network slicing;blockchain;computation migration;edge computing;edge intelligence;resource schedulingresource-allocation;blockchain;management;framework;communication;optimization;networks;internet;systems;design

Nevertheless, the global rise in urban dwellers is often accompanied by additional difficulties and challenges such as traffic jams, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste production. The term 'Smart City' is introduced to address these challenges by pushing residents to concentrate on the innovative solutions for economic growth of their cities as well as enhancing people's standard of living. The distributed ledger technology, also known as Blockchain, is best known for its instrumental role in forming the cryptocurrency space (e.g. Bitcoin and Ethereum). Due to features that include decentralization, transparency, democracy, security, and immutability; the deployment of Blockchain technologies in smart cities drastically improves data integrity, openness in city maintenance, and fosters the execution of reliable, transparent, safe, and democratized services and applications. In this survey, we perform an exhaustive study of research works that include the use of Blockchain technologies for smart city services and applications. First, we will examine the brief history of smart cities and Blockchain. We will then delve into the various ways that Blockchain technologies can be integrated into various smart city domains that include smart governance, smart transportation, smart grids, smart management, trade & finance, smart healthcare, smart home, e-commerce, and others that have a scope of development. Finally, this paper will provide areas of interest where Blockchain can be analyzed further to promote the development of smart cities application and services using Blockchain.	smart cities;blockchain;smart contracts;smart devices;smart transportation;smart gridenergy management;technologies;internet;future;security;vehicles;system

Therefore, life domains, such as learning and education, should have their systems redirected to adopt this topic to keep their availability and longevity. Many papers have discussed the metaverse, the applications to run on, and the historical progress to have the metaverse the way it is today. However, the framework of the metaverse itself is still unclear, and its components cannot be exactly specified. Although E-Learning systems are a need that has developed over the years along with technology, the structures of the available E-Learning systems based on the metaverse are either not well described or are adopted, in their best case, as just a 3D environment. In this paper, we examine some previous works to find out the special technologies that should be provided by the metaverse framework, then we discuss the framework of the metaverse if applied as an E-Learning environment framework. This will make it easy to develop future metaverse-based applications, as the proposed framework will make the virtual learning environments work smoothly on the metaverse. In addition, E-Learning will be a more interactive and pleasant process.	metaverse;e-learning;learning environment;metaverse architecture;digital twins;clouds-based applications
1727	实体经济	A secure two-qubit quantum model for segmentation and classification of brain tumor using MRI images based on blockchain	The size of the medical imaging data is increasing day by day which requires improved tools/applications to perform accurate and efficient diagnoses. Another important concern is to secure the patient's personal information. Therefore, this research work focuses on a novel secure framework for brain tumor diagnosis. The proposed methodology comprises three main core steps. Initially, the patient's MRI data are encrypted and decrypted using the SHA-256 algorithm to secure the brain data. The decrypted images are supplied to the 2-qubit quantum model named Javeria (J). Quantum model for tumor classification, which comprises three layers as two dense layers and one Keras layer with a softmax activation unit. The classified tumor images are input to the semantic segmentation model named J. SegCNN for tumor segmentation. The proposed J. SegCNN model contains 11 layers that are trained on selected batch-size and Adam optimizer solver. The proposed model provides a 98% dice similarity coefficient (DSC) which is far better as compared to the latest research works.	j;quantum;j;segcnn;semantic segmentation;blockchain;brain tumorneural-networks;features;fusion
1728	实体经济	An Anonymous IoT-Based E-Health Monitoring System Using Blockchain Technology	The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible for health institutions to have remote diagnosis, reliable, preventive, and real-time decision-making. However, the anonymity and privacy of patients are not considered in IoT. Therefore, this article proposes a blockchain-based anonymous system, known as GarliMediChain, for providing anonymity and privacy during COVID-19 information sharing. In GarliMediChain, garlic routing and blockchain are integrated to provide low-latency communication, privacy, anonymity, trust, and security. Also, COVID-19 information is encrypted multiple times before transmitting to a series of nodes in the network. To ensure that COVID-19 information is successfully shared, a blockchain-based coalition system is proposed. The coalition system enables health institutions to share information while maximizing their payoffs. In addition, each institution uses the proposed fictitious play to study the strategies of others in order to update its belief by selecting the best responses from them. Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed system is resistant to security-related attacks and is robust, efficient, and adaptive. From the results, the proposed proof-of-epidemiology-of-interest consensus protocol has 15.93% less computational cost than 26.30% of proof-of-work and 57.77% proof-of-authority consensus protocol, respectively. Nonetheless, the proposed GarliMediChain system promotes global collaborations by combining existing anonymity and trust solutions with the support of blockchain technology.	internet of things;covid-19;blockchains;routing;privacy;protocols;electronic mail;blockchain;e-health;internet of things (iot);healthcare;iot data;fictitious playframework
1729	实体经济	Permissioned Blockchain and Deep Reinforcement Learning Enabled Security and Energy Efficient Healthcare Internet of Things	Recently, the Healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) has been widely applied to alleviate the global challenge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, security and limited energy capacity issues remain the two main factors that prevent the large-scale application of the H-IoT. Therefore, a permissioned blockchain and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered H-IoT system is presented in this research to address these two issues. The proposed H-IoT system can provide real-time security and energy-efficient healthcare services to control the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the security issue, a permissioned blockchain method is adopted to guarantee the security of the proposed H-IoT system. As for handling the limited energy constraint, we employ the mobile edge computing (MEC) method to offload the computing tasks to alleviate the computational burden and energy consumption of the proposed H-IoT system. We also adopt an energy harvesting method to improve performance. In addition, a DRL method is employed to jointly optimize both the security and energy efficiency performance of the proposed system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution can balance the requirements of security and energy efficiency issues and hence can better respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.	covid-19;blockchains;security;pandemics;medical services;internet of things;industries;blockchain;deep reinforcement learning;mobile edge computing;energy harvesting;healthcare internet of things;covid-19industrial internet;iot;maximization
1730	实体经济	Cost-effectiveness and gain-sharing scenarios for purchasing a blockchain-based application in the maritime supply chain	Maritime supply chain (MarSC) stakeholders interact with third parties (e.g. freight forwarders, 3PLs, financial institutes, custom authorities) to facilitate the cargo flow and exchange of information, documents, or financials. Hence, MarSC stakeholders are increasingly interested in innovative technological solutions that vouch for the authenticity and/or the ownership of digital assets without the control of a central third party. Extended research is carried out to prove how applications based on the distributed ledger technology or blockchain address these requirements, yet limited research investigates their purchasing process and economic implications. This paper uses the phytosanitary certificate in an international supply chain flow as a case study where interaction between multiple stakeholders is fundamental and analyses the purchase scenarios of a blockchain-based tool. To do so, it uses a theoretical model that identifies and quantifies the costs and benefits incurred by MarSC stakeholders, formulates gain-sharing scenarios and presents the results of a sensitivity analysis to show the dependence between the data-use and the potential economic gains it generates. The results show that freight forwarders could share economic benefits with shippers or consignees to anticipate purchasing a blockchain-based tool.	cost-effectiveness;ict innovation;distributed ledger;information flow;maritime supply chainhorizontal cooperation;technology;logistics;coordination;performance;benefits;impact
1731	实体经济	Multi-Chain Collaboration-Based Information Management and Control for the Rice Supply Chain	The issue of food quality and safety is a major concern. Rice is considered one of the three staple foods. Rice quality and safety problems have occurred frequently, which seriously affect human health. The rice supply chain is characterized by complex links, discrete data, and numerous types of hazardous substances. Strengthening the information management and control capabilities of the rice supply chain is an important means to ensure the quality and safety of rice. Based on multi-chain collaboration, we have conducted research on information management and control of the rice supply chain. First, a multi-chain collaborative model of "blockchain + sub-chain" is designed. Based on this model, the following four mechanisms are designed: a trusted chain mechanism, a multi-level sub-chain encryption mechanism, a trusted supervision mechanism, and a hierarchical consensus mechanism. These mechanisms jointly serve the multi-chain collaborative management and control of the rice supply chain information. Secondly, smart contracts and operating procedures are designed, and a comparative analysis of them is executed. Finally, the design and implementation of the prototype system is carried out, and an example is verified and analyzed in a grain enterprise. Results show that this model serves the information supervision of the rice supply chain by studying the multi-chain collaboration. The study solves the real-time data interaction problem between each link of the rice supply chain. The credible management of information and control of the rice supply chain is accomplished. This study applies new information technology to the coordination and resource sharing of the food supply chain and provides ideas for the digital transformation of the food industry.	rice supply chain security;supply chain information management and control;blockchain;multi-chain collaboration;smart contracts;food safetyfood;technologies
1732	实体经济	The promise and perils of using artificial intelligence to fight corruption	Despite the growing number of initiatives that employ AI to counter corruption, few studies empirically tackle the political and social consequences of embedding AI in anti-corruption efforts. The authors outline the societal and technical challenges that need to be overcome for AI to fight corruption. Corruption presents one of the biggest challenges of our time, and much hope is placed in artificial intelligence (AI) to combat it. Although the growing number of AI-based anti-corruption tools (AI-ACT) have been summarized, a critical examination of their promises and perils is lacking. Here we argue that the success of AI-ACT strongly depends on whether they are implemented top-down (by governments) or bottom-up (by citizens, non-governmental organizations or journalists). Top-down use of AI-ACT can consolidate power structures and thereby pose new corruption risks. Bottom-up use of AI-ACT has the potential to provide unprecedented means for the citizenry to keep their government and bureaucratic officials in check. We outline the societal and technical challenges that need to be overcome to harness the potential for AI to fight corruption.	transparency;blockchain;media;power;fraud;ai

1734	平台项目	A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure for Information-Centric Networks	How to achieve secure content distribution and accountability in information-centric networking (ICN) is a crucial problem. Subscribers need to verify whether the data came from a reliable source, rather than from a spoofing adversary. Public key cryptography was introduced to achieve a method of authentication that binds the data packet to its owner. In existing prototypes, PKIs, identity-based signatures (IBSs) and recommendation networks are the common schemes used to ensure the authenticity and availability of public keys. However, CA-based PKIs and KGC-based IBSs have been proven to be weak when it comes to resisting security attacks, with recommendation networks being too complex to deploy. In this respect, we designed a novel distributed authentication model as a secure scheme to support public key cryptography. Our model establishes a decentralized public key infrastructure by combining the smart contracts of blockchain and optimized zero-knowledge proof-verifiable presentations by utilizing the DID project, which realizes the management of public key certificates through blockchain and ensures the authenticity and availability of public keys in decentralized infrastructure. Our scheme fundamentally solves the issues of security and feasibility in existing schemes and provides a more scalable solution with respect to authenticating data sources. An experiment demonstrated that our proposal is 20% faster than the original zero knowledge proof scheme in registration.	decentralized public key infrastructure (dpki);verifiable presentations;zero-knowledge proof;icn;blockchainscheme
1735	技术治理	Digital Marketing Enhancement of Cryptocurrency Websites through Customer Innovative Data Process	Today, more than ever, the popularity of decentralized payment systems has risen, creating an outbreak of new cryptocurrencies hitting the market. Unique websites have been staged for each cryptocurrency, where information and means for mining cryptocurrencies are available daily. People visit those cryptocurrency websites either from desktop or mobile devices. Thus, the impulsion for appropriate promotion of cryptocurrency websites and customer factors affecting it rises. The above process increases cryptocurrency organizations' website visibility, raising the need for customer relationships and satisfaction optimization concerning organizations' supply chain strategy. Research data were collected from 10 well-known cryptocurrency websites, regarding mobile and desktop devices, in 180 days, regarding on-site web analytics. Therefore, a model consisting of three stages was applied. Starting phase of the model pertains to statistical and regression analysis of cryptocurrency web analytics, followed by Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping and Agent-Based Model deployment. Throughout this study, methods for promoting cryptocurrency websites can be deduced from assessing specific website metrics and device preferences. Research results indicate that web analytics give a clearer image of customer behavior in cryptocurrency websites and, therefore, provide opportunities for further website optimization through increased web traffic and digital reputation.	strategic digital marketing;innovation process;decentralized systems;data analysis;web analytics;customer electronics;decision support systemsadoption;systems
1736	技术治理	Redesigning Bitcoin's Fee Market	The Bitcoin payment system involves two agent types: users that transact with the currency and pay fees and miners in charge of authorizing transactions and securing the system in return for these fees. Two of Bitcoin's challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin's pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the "monopolistic auction" [16], showing (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one's value) diminishes as the number of bids increases.	bitcoin;cryptocurrency;blockchain;auction-theory;fee-marketwillingness-to-pay;consumers

By exploiting the concepts of the Self Sovereign Identity, our proposal allows the identification of all involved stakeholders, the storage off-chain of all information, and that on-chain of the sole data necessary for the information notarization and certification, adopting multi-signature approval mechanisms where appropriate. In addition it allows the eligibility verification of the certificated information, providing also useful information for facility management. It is proposed as an innovative system and companies that adopt the Open Innovation paradigm might want to pursue it. The model proposal is designed exploiting the Veramo platform, hence the Ethereum Blockchain, and all the recommendations about Self Sovereign Identity systems given by the European Blockchain Partnership, and by the World Wide Web Consortium.	ssi;bmi;blockchain;iots;rfid tags;rfid readertraceability;technology;quality

1739	实体经济	Recycling Model Selection for Electronic Products Considering Platform Power and Blockchain Empowerment	This paper considers a dynamic platform-based, closed-loop supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and an online platform. As an online distributor of the manufacturer, the platform expands the market scale by exerting the platform power. At the same time, to solve the problem of inconsistency between the actual recycling amount and the theoretical recycling amount in the recycling process of waste electronic products, the whole-process supervision of waste products is carried out with the help of blockchain technology, which is difficult to tamper with and is traceable. With the help of differential game theory, four differential game models of manufacturer recycling and platform recycling with and without blockchain are established. The state feedback strategies are derived from Bellman's continuous dynamic programming theory. Through analytical results and comparative analysis, the adoption conditions of blockchain and the impact of blockchain on the selection of recycling models are obtained. The results illustrated that the introduction of blockchain technology effectively improves the real recycling rate of waste electronics, building trust in consumers, which benefits corporations in certain conditions. However, it amplifies the double marginal effect of the CLSC. Nevertheless, the implementation of blockchain is still beneficial to consumers, as the adverse impact of the double marginal effect is compensated by the improvement in consumer surplus. In addition, the study shows that the implementation of the blockchain incentivizes members, who benefit on the same recycling model when the fixed cost of the blockchain and the share ratio of the residual value of waste electronics are between certain thresholds. That is, both the manufacturer and the platform are better off in a manufacturer recycling model enabled by blockchain. Moreover, in this model, the social welfare and the recycling rate of waste electronics are increased, which enable the CLSC to achieve benefits related to economy, environment, and society.	waste electronic products;platform;closed-loop supply chain;recycling model;blockchainloop supply chain;reverse channel;e-waste;collection;marketplace;strategies
1740	核心技术	Cob: a leaderless protocol for parallel Byzantine agreement in incomplete networks	In this paper we extend the Multidimensional Byzantine Agreement (MBA) Protocol, a leaderless Byzantine agreement for lists of arbitrary values, into a protocol suitable for wide gossiping networks: Cob. This generalization allows the consensus process to be run by an incomplete network of nodes provided with (non-synchronized) same-speed clocks. Not all nodes are active in every step, so the network size does not hamper the efficiency, as long as the gossiping broadcast delivers the messages to every node in reasonable time. These network assumptions model more closely real-life communication channels, so Cob may be applicable to a variety of practical problems, such as blockchain platforms implementing sharding. Cob has the same Bernoulli-like distribution that upper-bounds the number of steps as the MBA protocol. We prove its correctness and security assuming a supermajority of honest nodes in the network, and compare its performance with Algorand.	distributed consensus;fault-tolerant protocols;blockchain

1742	协同技术	Credible Internet of Intelligence Toward Future Multidimensional Connection	In the multidimensional future connection, users' demands for high data rate, ubiquitous accessibility, and low latency have fueled the continuous advancement of artificial intelligence applications, especially edge intelligence. Meanwhile, the methodology of edge intelligence has been widely researched. However, there are some challenges remaining to be resolved, including the divisible feature of deep networks and the credibility of edge intelligence nodes. In this article, we consider a credible Internet of Intelligence (IoI) framework, with the help of deep networks segmentation and aggregation, as well as blockchain. Specifically, deep networks are separated into several sub-models to be trained by numerous edge trainers. Meanwhile, smart contract in the blockchain records and calculates the credibility of each edge trainer. According to the credibility, the trained sub-models would be adopted or abandoned. In order to show the effectiveness of the IoI system, we employ it to solve the problem of future multidimensional connection. Experimental results reveal the superior performance of the proposed scheme.	training;artificial intelligence;blockchains;task analysis;internet;training data;data modelsnetwork;communication
1743	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Architecture Design for Personal Health Record: Development and Usability Study	Background: The importance of blockchain-based architectures for personal health record (PHR) lies in the fact that they are thought and developed to allow patients to control and at least partly collect their health data. Ideally, these systems should provide the full control of such data to the respective owner. In spite of this importance, most of the works focus more on describing how blockchain models can be used in a PHR scenario rather than whether these models are in fact feasible and robust enough to support a large number of users. Objective: To achieve a consistent, reproducible, and comparable PHR system, we build a novel ledger-oriented architecture out of a permissioned distributed network, providing patients with a manner to securely collect, store, share, and manage their health data. We also emphasize the importance of suitable ledgers and smart contracts to operate the blockchain network as well as discuss the necessity of standardizing evaluation metrics to compare related (net)works. Methods: We adopted the Hyperledger Fabric platform to implement our blockchain-based architecture design and the Hyperledger Caliper framework to provide a detailed assessment of our system: first, under workload, ranging from 100 to 2500 simultaneous record submissions, and second, increasing the network size from 3 to 13 peers. In both experiments, we used throughput and average latency as the primary metrics. We also created a health database, a cryptographic unit, and a server to complement the blockchain network. Results: With a 3-peer network, smart contracts that write on the ledger have throughputs, measured in transactions per second (tps) in an order of magnitude close to 102 tps, while those contracts that only read have rates close to 10(3) tps. Smart contracts that write also have latencies, measured in seconds, in an order of magnitude close to 10(1) seconds, while that only read have delays close to 10(0) seconds. In particular, smart contracts that retrieve, list, and view history have throughputs varying, respectively, from 1100 tps to 1300 tps, 650 tps to 750 tps, and 850 tps to 950 tps, impacting the overall system response if they are equally requested under the same workload. Varying the network size and applying an equal fixed load, in turn, writing throughputs go from 10(2) tps to 10(1) tps and latencies go from 101 seconds to 102 seconds, while reading ones maintain similar values. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate, using Hyperledger Caliper, the performance of a PHR blockchain architecture and the first to evaluate each smart contract separately. Nevertheless, blockchain systems achieve performances far below what the traditional distributed databases achieve, indicating that the assessment of blockchain solutions for PHR is a major concern to be addressed before putting them into a real production.	electronic health record;personal health record;blockchain;smart contractelectronic medical-records;information exchange;framework;systems
1744	实体经济	B2H: Enabling delay-tolerant blockchain network in healthcare for Society 5.0	This paper introduces an architecture - B2H - to enable a delay-tolerant public blockchain network (PBCN) in healthcare systems for Society 5.0. Healthcare systems in Society 5.0 envision an abstract paradigm that provides beyond health monitoring services to all the citizens of the society. These services include healthcare medical supply chain, clinical trial, and hospital management. To provide these services, the existing healthcare systems upload their important information, such as users' health parameters, medicinal details, and clinical trial information into the cloud using PBCN (Ioppolo et al., 2020). Additionally, PBCN provides end-to-end security in uploading of such healthcare information in healthcare systems by decentralizing and distributing the information validation among multiple end-user devices. The existing PBCN-based healthcare systems enable its users to validate information before the transaction of healthcare information. Enabling such a facility in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0 increases the validation latency of PBCN in healthcare systems, considering the presence of a huge number of citizens in Society 5.0. On the other hand, the existing PBCN-based healthcare systems are unable to detect malicious end-users, which may degrade the efficiency of the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. We introduce B2H to address the issues of increasing validation latency and detecting malicious end-users in the healthcare systems of Society 5.0. The architecture of B2H utilizes the features of PBCN. B2H introduce a layer of validation service providers (VSPs) in a PBCN that collects information from the end-user, distributes it among multiple validation devices. VSP in B2H reduces the validation time by distributing the information among a specific set of validation devices (VDs). B2H also allows the end-user to optimally select a VSP and a VSP to select a set of validation devices optimally. Through extensive experiments, we observe that B2H performs better than the existing schemes by reducing 94%-95% average network delay, 88%-94% average energy consumption, and 94%-96% average cost.	blockchain;secure healthcare;society 5;0;delay-tolerant;long short-term memory (lstm)prediction
1745	实体经济	Communication model enhancement using electronic health record standard for tertiary hospital	Background: Communication of patient information in a healthcare setting in previous years was based on documented information on paper records carried from one location to another. However, with the introduction of electronic health records (EHRs), communications are now conducted electronically via installed and connected computer systems that are networked together. Inadequate communication of patients' information can deter patients' health and threaten their lives, putting them in unnecessary danger. Objective: The objective of this study was to design a standard EHR template model of communication for tertiary hospital that can be used in communicating patients' information between various departments involved in the management of patients without carrying papers around or tossing Patients or their relatives up and down. Method: The research adopts soft system methodology (SSM) with communication concepts from knowledge management, combining observations with various practical information to make a conclusion based on past experiences through a process of inductive reasoning, a communication model was developed that can be used as a template for hospitals to upgrade/integrate paper-based patient information management to electronic based in a bid to enhance patient care and information management. Results: The developed communication template model has been designed to be adopted for use in a bid to manage patients' information electronically in all tertiary hospitals and other hospitals that may so desire its use. Conclusion: It is observed from this article that communication in hospitals through EHR template is user friendly, safe and possible within the hospital and to outside facilities for effective paperless management of patients.	communication model;patients' health information;electronic health records;the flow of information;data security;blockchain distributed information technologyinformation;technology;care

1747	实体经济	Private Blockchain-Cloud System (PBCS) for Healthcare Services	Blockchain in the recent times stands as a buzz word to deal with a huge set of real-time applications that function in a manual way rather than in an automated manner. There may be several intermediate phases involved to access legitimate records of significance in various sectors like financial industry, supply chain market, educational organizations, healthcare systems, etc. But, when the amount of data is enormous, manual steps to infer a conclusion after undergoing verification and validation phases is a time-consuming approach. Hence, there is a necessity to automate the process flow using emerging tools and technologies such as blockchain. Towards this end, a novel private blockchain-cloud system (PBCS) for healthcare services is proposed in this work. A model is presented to secure the patient records via e-block access platform where only the person holding the legitimate key can access the data. Security is further strengthened by deploying the blocks of a blockchain in the cloud environment.	admin;blockchain;cloud;consortium;healthcare;patients;private key;security
1748	协同技术	Securing Fog Computing with a Decentralised User Authentication Approach Based on Blockchain	The use of low-cost sensors in IoT over high-cost devices has been considered less expensive. However, these low-cost sensors have their own limitations such as the accuracy, quality, and reliability of the data collected. Fog computing offers solutions to those limitations; nevertheless, owning to its intrinsic distributed architecture, it faces challenges in the form of security of fog devices, secure authentication and privacy. Blockchain technology has been utilised to offer solutions for the authentication and security challenges in fog systems. This paper proposes an authentication system that utilises the characteristics and advantages of blockchain and smart contracts to authenticate users securely. The implemented system uses the email address, username, Ethereum address, password and data from a biometric reader to register and authenticate users. Experiments showed that the proposed method is secure and achieved performance improvement when compared to existing methods. The comparison of results with state-of-the-art showed that the proposed authentication system consumed up to 30% fewer resources in transaction and execution cost; however, there was an increase of up to 30% in miner fees.	authentication;iot;cloud computing;fog computing;blockchain technology;smart contractsiot;architecture;system;framework;edge
1749	实体经济	RATIONALE FOR THE NEED TO USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY TO RECORD AND CONTROL OPERATIONS FOR THE EXPORT OF GRAIN (THE EXAMPLE OF UKRAINE)	Despite the steady export of Ukrainian grain growth, the net profit from its sales does not increase, and most times, even falls. That is why it became necessary to find out the reasons for the current situation and find ways out of it. The most common method for solving such problems in the modern world is the implementation 61 blockchain and related technologies (smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, etc.). This article is devoted to studying the economic need for the use of blockchain technologies to monitor grain for export in Ukraine and the analysis of foreign experience blockchain implementation to agricultural supply chains to adapt the best practices to Ukrainian realities. As a result of a theoretical study, the article identified problems in Ukrainian grain export, analyzed the results of using blockchain to solve similar problems in foreign countries, and also identified ways to use world experience in this area. In addition, the authors offered practical recommendations for changing and complementing the existing technological and logistic stages of grain export in Ukraine. It was also found that blockchain technologies, because of their properties such as decentralized control, security, traceability, and control of transactions, could solve most of the problems that arise in the grain supply chain from grower to end consumer. The authors have proposed a generalized multilayer system that includes a "Data input layer", a "Data store layer", and a "User's layer", which most fully considers the peculiarities of agriculture in Ukraine. However, the question of these technologies introducing cost and the economic feasibility of their use for farms of various sizes remains is still unclear, and will be considered by the authors in their following works.	blockchain;agricultural supply chain;smart-contract;wheat export;ukrainechallenges
1750	实体经济	Application Prospects of Blockchain Technology to Support the Development of Interport Communities	A key aspect for the efficiency and security of maritime transport is linked to the associated information flows. The optimal management of maritime transport requires the sharing of data in real-time between the various participating organizations. Moreover, as supply chains become increasingly integrated, the connectivity of stakeholders must be ensured not only within the single port but also between ports. Blockchain could offer interesting opportunities in this regard and is believed to have a huge impact on the future of the digitization of the port and maritime industry. This document analyzes the state of art and practice of blockchain applications in the maritime industry and explores the application prospects and practical implications of blockchain for building an interport community. The paper uses SWOT analysis to address several research questions concerning the practical impacts and barriers related to the implementation of blockchain technology in port communities and develops a Proof of Concept (PoC) to concretely show how blockchain technology can be applied to roll-on roll-off transport and interport communities in real environments. In this regard, this study intends to contribute to the sector literature by providing a detailed framework that describes how to proceed to choose the correct blockchain scheme and implement the various management and operational aspects of an interport community by benefiting from the blockchain.	blockchain;proof of concept;smart port;maritime transport;ro-ro transport;swotimplementation
1751	实体经济	An Artificial Neural Network Examination of the Intention to Implement Blockchain in the Supply Chains of SMEs in Tonga	The research intends to examine the impacts of the technology, organization, and environmental factors on the implementation of blockchain in the supply chains of SMEs in the Kingdom of Tonga. These include regulatory support, competitive pressure, cost, upper management support, complexity, and relative advantage. The research uses SEM-PLS to test the hypotheses and the artificial neural network method to analyze and classify survey data from 201 SMEs. Findings show that relative advantage, cost, complexity, and competitive pressure significantly affect implementing blockchain in the supply chains. As SMEs frequently have limited capital to invest in technology but meets the same obligations to streamline business operations to optimize profits, blockchain provides a feasible choice for the firms' sustainability with its characteristics of security, transparency, and immutability that are prospective to develop SMEs' performance. Thus, the paper provides novel insight regarding the determinants of SMEs' intention to implement blockchain in their supply chains.	artificial neural network (ann) analysis;blockchain;pls-sem;supply chain management;technology;toe frameworkadoption intention;industry 4.0;big data;pls-sem;mobile;determinants;future;intelligence;performance;technology
1752	协同技术	Dimensions of Internet of Things: Technological Taxonomy Architecture Applications and Open Challenges-A Systematic Review	We are traversing the growing emerging technology paradigms in today's advanced technological world. In this present era, the Internet of Things (IoT) is extensively used in all sectors. IoT is the ecosystem of smart devices which contains sensors, smart objects, networking, and processing units. These integrated devices provide better services to the end user. IoT is impacting our environment and is becoming one of the most popular technologies.

1753	协同技术	DPRL: Task Offloading Strategy Based on Differential Privacy and Reinforcement Learning in Edge Computing	Mobile edge computing has been widely used in various IoT devices due to its excellent computing power and good interaction speed. Task offloading is the core of mobile edge computing. However, most of the existing task offloading strategies only focus on improving the unilateral performance of MEC, such as security, delay, and overhead. Therefore, focus on the security, delay and overhead of MEC, we propose a task offloading strategy based on differential privacy and reinforcement learning. This strategy optimizes the overhead required for the task offloading process while protecting user privacy. Specifically, before task offloading, differential privacy is used to interfere with the user's location information to avoid malicious edge servers from stealing user privacy. Then, on the basis of ensuring user privacy and security, combined with the resource environment of the MEC network, reinforcement learning is used to select appropriate edge servers for task offloading. Simulation results show that our scheme improves the performance of MEC in many aspects, especially in security and resource consumption. Compared with the typical privacy protection scheme, the security is improved by 7%, and the resource consumption is reduced by 9% compared with the typical task offloading strategy.	task analysis;privacy;servers;optimization;reinforcement learning;differential privacy;delays;mobile edge computing;task offloading;differential privacy;reinforcement learningmobile;blockchain;iot
1754	实体经济	Cryptoart and Digital Humanities: Transtechnological Perspectives and the Challenge of Tactical Positions	Contemporary times always pose a challenge for theoreticians who try to map it and encode it. Nevertheless, it is more than important to grapple with present times and bring out the topics that can engage understanding of present discourses, potentials, and possibilities. It is even more true with art and humanities that, each on its side, faced significant challenges from the rise of technology-driven reality. As for the art, it seems that technology gives more opportunities and options than ever, but it is not without questions of value, authenticity, ownership, commodification, or artivist practices. As for the humanities, they already faced the alleged "crisis" due to the new wave of technocracy. New technology offers new media, new languages, and new discourses. But is it all good news? Should art and humanities form a kind of a (trans)tactical (im)pact and adopt the technology language, or would such a turn create more slippery points than easy-going practices? This paper will try to examine transdisciplinary and transtechnological coordinates of art and humanities taking the case study of cryptoart and blockchain system usage in contemporary artistic practices. This will also engage the discussion about digital humanities, which might be one of the next transdisciplinary steps to continue the fierce line of experimentation, and to combat the trend of going back to disciplinary frameworks.	digital humanities;technology;trans-tactical positions;cryptoart;experimenta-tion
1755	市场治理	What drives DeFi prices? Investigating the effects of investor attention	We comparatively assess drivers of DeFi token prices, testing the impact and connectedness between Bitcoin (as a cryptocurrency asset-class leader), Ethereum (as a platform for DeFi), and Google Trends (as a signal of investor attention). While we evidence varying causal linkages between Bitcoin or Ethereum and Defi tokens, these linkages are restricted to bear markets. In contrast, restricted MS-VAR (LR) modelling uncovers bi-causal relationships between DeFi tokens and investor sentiment in both bull and bear markets. We conclude that, rather than platform valuation, investor attention is a dominant driver of DeFi prices, with DeFi being a separate asset class from mainstream cryptocurrencies.	defi;cryptocurrency;ms-var;causality;connectedness;sentiment;defi;cryptocurrency;ms-var;causality;connectedness;sentimentreturns

1757	实体经济	Blockchain technology in food supply chains: Review and bibliometric analysis	Increase in global population growth and the consequent rise in the demand for food while ensuring quality, preventing wastage, avoiding deforestation, and carbon footprinting has put tremendous pressure on the global food supply chain (FSC). Due to fast computing facilities and availability of data, blockchain technology has emerged as a potential system that may help in developing a safe and secure FSC. Blockchain has gained significant attention among researchers worldwide, which is evident from the extensive literature generated on this subject within a span of a few years. Through this paper, the authors attempt to showcase the immense scope and significance of blockchain in FSCs by examining and analyzing the existing studies. In addition to providing an overview of the application of blockchain in FSCs, this study also discusses challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and high cost and suggests potential solutions for the existing difficulties in adopting blockchain in FSCs. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis is provided to acquaint researchers and practitioners with the structure and research trends in this area. The study found that researchers have mostly focused on the applicability of blockchain for product authentication, finance, and logistics. Further, blockchain is likely to become a dominant technology for enhancing transparency and traceability, reducing risk and, most importantly, enhancing trust among different stakeholders in the area of FSC.	blockchain technology;food supply chain;traceability;transparency;food integrity;food safety;smart farmingtraceability system;architecture;agriculture;challenges;provenance
1758	实体经济	An Architecture for Distributed Energies Trading in Byzantine-Based Blockchains	With the development of smart cities, not only are all corners of the city connected to each other, but also connected from city to city. They form a large distributed network together, which can facilitate the integration of Distributed Energy Stations (DESs) and corresponding smart aggregators. Nevertheless, because of potential security and privacy protection arising from trustless energies trading, how to make such energies trading go smoothly is a tricky challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multiple energies trading (B-MET) system for secure and efficient energies trading by executing a smart contract we design. Because energies trading requires the blockchain in B-MET system to have high throughput and low latency, we design a new byzantine-based consensus mechanism (BCM) based on node's credit to improve efficiency for the consortium blockchain under the B-MET system. Then, we take combined heat and power (CHP) system as a typical example that provides distributed energies. We quantify their utilities and model the interactions between aggregators and DESs in a smart city by a novel multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. It is analyzed and solved by reaching Nash equilibrium between aggregators, which reflects the competition between aggregators to purchase energies from DESs. In the end, we conduct plenty of numerical simulations to evaluate and verify our proposed model and algorithms, which demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.	blockchains;games;smart cities;cogeneration;resistance heating;security;throughput;distributed energies trading;smart city;consortium blockchain;byzantine consensus;stackelberg gameoperation;internet;power
1759	实体经济	Dual-blockchain-based P2P energy trading system with an improved optimistic rollup mechanism	Blockchain technology has been recognised as a promising technology for supporting Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading-an emerging paradigm in which energy trading is performed directly between end energy customers. The state-of-the-art blockchain designs for P2P energy trading can only support less compute-intensive energy trading tasks and/or rely on the set up of a long challenge time to ensure correctness of transactions, which restricts the systems' scalability and applicability in the diverse P2P energy trading applications. This paper proposes a new dual-blockchain system for P2P energy trading. The system consists of a primary blockchain and a secondary blockchain. The primary blockchain is mainly responsible for storing the data of P2P energy trading transactions while the compute-intensive tasks (e.g. pricing and transaction verification) are executed in the secondary blockchain. An Improved Optimistic Rollup (IOR) mechanism is proposed to facilitate the co-operation of the dual blockchains. Through a specific 'executor-validator' mechanism and a group of specific smart contracts with different functions, the IOR mechanism can effectively accommodate the dual blockchains to execute the P2P energy trading transactions in a computational efficient manner while ensuring the correctness and security of the transactions. A prototype of the proposed system is implemented on Fisco Bcos and Alibaba Cloud and comprehensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system.

Advances in technologies have offered profitable opportunities, but the general public has difficulty accessing appropriate information on digital currency exchange platforms to facilitate their investments and trading. This study aims to provide a decision support system using analytic models that will guide the public in deciding the appropriate digital currency exchange platform for trading and investment. The overarching objective is to support the public in embracing the new era of a dependable, trustworthy, and sustainable digital society. Particularly, this study offers an analytics model that compares numerous well-known digital currency exchange platforms based on the opinions of 34 human expert members on six main criteria to identify the most suitable platform. In this study, the analytic hierarchy process approach, which is a multiple-criteria decision-making method, and Expert Choice software were used for decision support. Using pairwise comparisons of exchanges with respect to the criteria in the software, the weight of each exchange was determined, and these weights became the basis for prioritizing the exchange platform. This study provides valuable insight into how an analytics-driven expert system can support the public in selecting their digital currency exchange platform. This work is an integral part of an effort to help disruptive digital technology become widely accepted by the general public.	blockchain;cryptocurrency;evaluation;quantitative method;platformsneural-networks;pls-sem;cryptocurrency;scheme;prediction;blockchain;readiness

However, there are still unsolved issues on communication efficiency and data security due to the huge models and unreliable transmission links. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel federated edge learning system, called LightFed, where the edge nodes upload only vital partial local models, and successfully achieve lightweight communication and model aggregation. First, a novel model aggregation method Model Splitting and Splicing (MSS) and a Selective Parameter Transmission (SPT) scheme are proposed. By detecting the updating gradients of local parameters and filtering significant parameters, selective rotated transmission and efficient aggregation of local models are achieved. Second, a Training Filling Model (TFM) is proposed to infer the total data distribution of edge nodes, and train a filling model to mitigate the unbalanced training data without violating the data privacy of individual users. Moreover, a blockchain-powered confusion transmission mechanism is proposed for defending the attacks from external adversaries and protecting the model information. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our LightFed significantly outperforms the existing FEL systems in terms of communication efficiency and privacy security.	data models;computational modeling;training;mathematical models;servers;security;data privacy;federated edge learning;communication efficiency;privacy protection;deep neural networkblockchain

1763	实体经济	Efficient Consistency Consensus Algorithm of Blockchain for Heterogeneous Nodes in the Internet of Vehicles	Because hetero geneous nodes of internet of vehicles have big performance difference and mobility, it leads that blockchain consensus algorithm has many problems, such as low transaction through put and large transaction delay. Therefore, an Efficient Consistency Consensus Algorithm (ECCA) of blockchain for heterogeneous nodes in the internet of vehicles is proposed. In ECCA, the heterogeneous nodes of internet of vehicles which consists of verification nodes, general nodes and malicious nodes are considered. The credit rating mechanism is proposed to realize the classification of credit rating and division of three types of hetero geneous nodes. Then, a cross-region node identity change mechanism is proposed to adjust timely the node identity in the current region is proposed. Finally, an improved consensus algorithm is proposed to meet the timeliness requirement of the internet of vehicles. The simulation results show that the ECCA algorithm can reduce the impact of poorly performing general nodes and malicious nodes on the efficiency of block consensus, and increase transaction through put and reduces average transaction delay and average node communication overhead.	internet of vehicles;heterogeneous nodes;blockchain;consistency consensus;credit rating
1764	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Trust Verification and Streaming Service Awareness for Big Data-Driven 5G and Beyond Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication	Vigorous security and transparency with minimum latency and a high data rate are some of the key requirements for 5G and beyond vehicular networks especially in case of big data-driven vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication applications which plays an important role in enabling advance intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and Internet of Vehicle (IoV) based network. The trace-ability in blockchain makes it one of the vital options, back-boned by the decentralized network to ensure independent security and privacy by exploiting the hash of a previous transaction with the time stamp and announcing it publicly for rejection of possible adversary attack. Therefore, in this work, we have opted for blockchains for trusted authentication and service awareness in 5G and beyond vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication-based vehicular networks to stream blocks by certifying privacy and security. Here, we have considered blockchain as intermediary trusted agent to witness communication between a vehicle node and edge node, where edge node also uploads microservices along with calling figure of microservices to the blockchain. Furthermore, to ensure vehicle privacy with joint verification of vehicular network and server, we have devised a mechanism in which every vehicle nodes anonymously ask for services from the edge server along with signing an individual's identity. Moreover, based on generated vehicle requests and service awareness, we devised an improved edge cache scheme for the prior compilation of services at each edge. In comparison to the previous state-of-art work, the result shows that our proposed work handles the requests more efficiently to achieve a better service request cache hit rate generated by vehicles at the edge server.	efficient;network;secure
1765	实体经济	A blockchain-based framework for on-site construction environmental monitoring: Proof of concept	On-site construction environmental monitoring (OCEM) can help to govern the behaviors of construction stakeholders in terms of pollutant emissions and environmental protection. Current OCEM systems, nevertheless, were built utilizing a centralized architecture, such as the government's local database, which leads to information imbalance and disputes among multiple stakeholders. When there are no trustworthy data records to justify construction companies' compliance, for example, arguments or even conflicts may emerge between neighboring residents and the contractors. Blockchain has the potential to be a reliable platform for environmental monitoring due to its decentralization, immutability, transparency, and autonomous enforcement of agreements. However, there has been limited investigation into the blockchain's possibilities in OCEM. Aiming to bridge the knowledge gap, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled framework for OCEM. To begin, an overall conceptual framework was created, in which construction pollutant data was collected via sensors and then uploaded to the blockchain network. Then, based on the consensus algorithm, the on-chained information flow was introduced. Smart contracts were programmed to automatically monitor the level of construction pollutants and evaluate environmental performance. Finally, a case study was carried out to validate the theoretical viability of the proposed framework in a laboratory environment, in which a blockchain prototype based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture was presented. The results indicate that blockchain can assist OCEM by supplying trustworthy environmental data and allowing for continuous monitoring. This research investigated the blockchain's potential in OCEM and created a prototype system that can be fine-tuned for use in real-world scenarios.	blockchain;smart contracts;on-site construction environmental monitoring;construction pollutant;construction industryperformance;pollution;system;noise
1766	市场治理	Asymmetric effects of economic policy uncertainty on Bitcoin's hedging power	Purpose Even though Bitcoin has been often labelled as a safe haven asset class in the literature, the influence of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on the diversifying opportunities offered by Bitcoin in relation to other assets needs to be investigated. This paper aims to investigate how the EPU affects diversification of commodity, conventional, Islamic and sustainable equity returns in relation to its impact on Bitcoin returns. Design/methodology/approach The authors use advanced time-series econometrics, namely, multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic-dynamic conditional correlation and continuous wavelet transformation, for the analysis of the daily returns for the aforementioned assets between 01 August 2011 and 01 September 2019. Findings First, the authors found a strong evidence of Bitcoin's mean reverting trend in the long run while its volatility has decreased significantly since 2013. After separating the EPU into two regimes (high and low), diversification opportunities with Bitcoin seems to disappear in a high EPU period, while the hedging opportunity tends to prevail in a low EPU period for all classes of assets. Importantly, the findings indicate that Bitcoin offers short-term diversification for sustainable and Islamic equity as well as energy stocks during a low uncertainty period. Consequently, in relation to the policy uncertainty, Bitcoin provides similar hedging opportunities than commodities like Gold and Silver. Overall, the study shows that EPU is remarkably important in explaining the average portfolio returns of Bitcoin, suggesting that this indicator can be perceived as a decent explanatory factor for portfolio diversification. Originality/value The study significantly extends the empirical literature of Bitcoin's portfolio diversification by taking EPU into consideration. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is one of the few studies to investigate the asymmetric effects of US EPU on Bitcoin's hedging capabilities by taking into account major conventional equity, sustainable equity, Islamic equity, gold, silver and oil.	bitcoin;economic policy uncertainty;cryptocurrency;commodity;islamic and sustainable equity;d80;e22;g12portfolio diversification benefits;dynamic conditional correlation;investment horizons;mgarch-dcc;safe haven;volatility;movements;exchange;returns;risk
1767	核心技术	Anonymous Traceability Protocol Based on Group Signature for Blockchain	In blockchain technology, data are stored on decentralized nodes and public to each node in the blockchain network. Hence, the focus of privacy protection in the blockchain guarantees the anonymity of transactions such that attackers cannot attain the users' personal information through data analysis. Among the existing privacy protection technologies, the scheme based on group signature has good anonymity, but the existing scheme exists a large number of operations that are difficult to apply to wireless terminals. In this paper, using the powerful offloading capability of edge computing, we propose a blockchain node traceable identity privacy technology scheme based on threshold group signature, and the scheme greatly reduces the computing burden of nodes while achieving node privacy protection.	
1768	实体经济	STRICTs: A Blockchain-enabled Smart Emission Cap Restrictive and Carbon Permit Trading System	As the first legally binding global agreement on climate change, the Paris Agreement aims to limit long-term global warming to less than 2 ?, preferably below 1.5 ? compared to pre-industrial levels. Road transport, as one of the primary sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions, has great potential for energy conservation and emission reduction in achieving the climate goals. However, current approaches cannot efficiently reduce road travel, making it challenging to decarbonize in the transport sector. Therefore, in this paper, we propose STRICTs, a blockchain-enabled motor vehicle restrictive and trading system based on the carbon emissions cap. STRICTs allows automated carbon emission auditing and carbon emission violation punishment without relying on third-party escrow. Through a decentralized enforcer, STRICTs also enables carbon permit trading reliably and transparently. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype of the system based on Hyperledger Fabric and conduct experiments for comprehensive performance evaluation through CO2 Emission by Vehicles dataset. The experiment results show the practically affordable performance of STRICTs.	blockchain;carbon permit;carbon footprint;transportation;internet of vehicles;carbon trading;auditingenergy;scheme;sector
1769	核心技术	Federation payment tree: An improved payment channel for scaling and efficient ZK-hash time lock commitment framework in blockchain technology	Federation Payment Tree, a new Off-chain with zero-knowledge hash time lock commitment setup is proposed in this paper. The security of blockchain is based on consensus protocols that delay when number of concurrent transactions processed in given throughput framework. The scalability of blockchain is the ability to perform support increasing workload transaction. The FP-Tree provides zero knowledge hash lock commitment connect with off-chain protocols by using the payment channel, which enables execution of off-chain protocol that allows interaction between the parties without involving the consensus protocol. It allows to make payment across an authorization path of payment channel. Such a payment tree requires two commitment scheme is Timelock and Fundlock, each party lock fund for a time period. The main challenges we faced in this paper is that the computational power, storage and cryptography. Furthermore, we discussed many attacks on off-chain payment channel that allows a malicious adversary to make fund lose. The FP-Tree supports multi-parti computation (MPC) merging transactions into single hash value in payment tree. We enable the parties to generate single hash value by consumes both less than 0 (log(2) N ) and space less than 0 (log(2) N ) time combine element over length of single hash. The results were discussed in this paper and efficiency of FP-Tree is well suited for the blockchain technology. We achieved the accuracy of 60.2% in federated payment tree when compared with the proof of work and proof of authority.	blockchain technology;transitions payment tree;payment channel;zero knowledge proof;multi-parties computation;hash time locksystem
1770	实体经济	Adopting blockchain technology to block less sustainable products? entry in global trade	In this study, we examine how the use of blockchain technology deters less sustainable products' entry (LSPE) in the cross-border supply chains in which the entrant produces less sustainable products and enters into the incumbent's market. We identify that when the blockchain adoption cost exceeds a threshold, the entry can be blocked by mandatory blockchain adoption and the incumbent enjoys the monopoly position; when the blockchain adoption cost falls into an intermediate range, deterrence needs not only the use of blockchain technology but also price distortion by the incumbent; when the blockchain adoption cost is sufficiently low, the incumbent must compete with the entrant because blockchain technology is no longer effective for deterrence. Moreover, we examine how government intervention (tariff or subsidy) affects LSPE and find that both tariff and subsidy schemes can enhance the value of adopting blockchain technology to prevent LSPE. If the blockchain adoption cost is moderate, then levying tariffs on LSPE can achieve an economic and environment-dominating outcome, but the subsidy scheme cannot. Our findings provide managerial insights for cross-border supply chain managers and offer guidance to policy makers who design trade policies.	sustainability;entry deterrence;blockchain;chain-to-chain competition;global tradecompetition;decisions;coordination;logistics;capacity;quality
1771	实体经济	Blockchain technology in migrant and refugee health - A scoping review	Background The increase of forcibly displaced people worldwide is a challenge for health systems and their ability to provide access and equity in Health as a universal right. In the case of migrants and refugees, their journey exacerbates this challenge, as they go through diverse countries, camps, and humanitarian teams. Hence, the collection and analysis of health data are essential in providing quality care. The scientific community has been studying health digital technologies to answer health data consolidation, transparency, and global surveillance efficiency issues. Observing some empirical experiments with Blockchain in migrants and refugee health, we assessed the state-of-the-art by conducting a literature review. Methods Blockchain applications are still emerging, which means that peer-reviewed literature may still be scarce in life science databases. Therefore, to gather the most appropriate available evidence, we used a diverse and balanced set of databases that compile articles and journals from different fields. We used a multi-step scoping review to refine search keywords and analyse the literature. We included studies between 2008 and 2021 that reported value, utility, or use cases of Blockchain in support of migrant and refugee health. Results We identified a total of 69 articles, with 22 retained for full-text analysis and 8 of those being relevant. We employed Rayyan application to manage and evaluate the references by two researchers working independently. We identified two main uses of Blockchain technology to support migrant and refugee health: mitigate the lack of personal identification and make health records available. Blockchain also promotes data reliability in humanitarian aid, academic certificates, legal contracts, and financial transactions. Conclusions The availability of reliable information about individuals facilitates universal health coverage, improves cooperation between diaspora-related countries, and supports global health efficiency in line with the third goal of the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 agenda. Given its characteristics of decentralization, resilience, transparency, and auditability, Blockchain remains a promising avenue for future research in migrant and refugee health.	professor;low transportation costs;economic pressures;demographic trends;environmental degrada-
1772	实体经济	BMP: A blockchain assisted meme prediction method through exploring contextual factors from social networks	In the era of social networks, the scale and speed of online information dissemination have been greatly enhanced, thus leading to a large number of meme being generated, spread and popularized in the Internet. Social networks strongly promote the replication and dissemination of modalities, which are powerfully explosive and can be copied and spread in large numbers in a short period of time. Because of the typical decentralized nature of meme propagation in social networks, the development of blockchain technology provides a reliable environment for meme propagation models. However, there are various hurdles to using online user behavior data to predict meme popularity, such as the fact that there are only a few user comments and retweets beneath a meme topic, making it difficult to predict meme popularity directly by basic social data mining at this moment. In this scenario, mining the contextual information of web users can considerably increase meme prediction performance. Because social data contains a wealth of contextual and user relationship characteristics, we offer for the first time a blockchain-assisted based meme popularity prediction (BMP) mechanism based on empirical approach. To begin, we suggest a blockchain-based data storage approach to mimic a decentralized ecosystem. Following that, we assess meme popularity in terms of four contextually based web user characteristics. Finally, using a probabilistic linear model, we present a meme popularity prediction model that integrates the four contextual characteristics. By making a comparison of comprehensive tests with existing methodologies, we illustrate the usefulness and accuracy of our proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed meme prediction approach can provide a meme prediction service with high accuracy, a well-defined decentralized environment, and steady performance, making it a reliable service for recommendation systems and web-based information dissemination.

1773	核心技术	An innovative approach for resource sharing and scheduling in a sustainable distributed manufacturing system	Secure, transparent, and sustainable distributed manufacturing system (DMS) is a pressing need for current Industry 4.0. In this paper, exchange of highly sensitive information in a more transparent and secure way and to avoid the misunderstandings and trust issues between the enterprises a smart contract based on blockchain technology has been proposed in case of a distributed manufacturing environment. Here, we used a public permission less Ethereum platform to execute the smart contracts in the Blockchain to process the customer orders and to identify the right enterprise. Later, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated for optimal resource sharing and scheduling in a considered sustainable DMS. The objectives of the proposed model consist of simultaneously improvement of the performance measures such as makespan, machine utilization, energy consumption, and reliability. To solve this MILP model, a new Multi-objective-based Hybridized Moth Flame Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm (HMFEO) is developed and then the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-III). The results obtained from implementing the model using experimental data along with different cases show the efficiency and the validity of the proposed model and solution approach. Moreover, several performance indicators like hyper volume are increased by nearly 15-20 % that shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm with the NSGA-III.	blockchain technology;network-based distributed manufacturing&nbsp;systems;moth flame evolutionary optimization&nbsp;algorithm;smart contract;ethereumoptimization algorithm;blockchain;management;traceability;integration;challenges;network;jobs

Test cases are standard means to ensure the correctness of data flows in smart contracts. To more efficiently generate test cases with high coverage, we propose an improved genetic algorithm-based test-case generation approach for smart contract data flow testing. Our approach introduces the theory of particle swarm optimization into the genetic algorithm, which reduces the influence brought by the randomness of genetic operations and enhances its capability to find global optima. A set of 30 real smart contracts deployed on Ethereum and GitHub is collected to perform the experimental study, on which our approach is compared with three baseline approaches. The experimental results show that, in most cases, the coverage of the test cases generated by our approach is significantly higher than the baseline approaches with relatively lower numbers of iterations and lower execution time.	testing;smart contracts;genetic algorithms;blockchains;genetics;statistics;sociology;data flow testing;genetic algorithm;particle swarm optimization algorithm;smart contract;test-case generation
1775	协同技术	ML-DDoS: A Blockchain-Based Multilevel DDoS Mitigation Mechanism for IoT Environments	Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks as well as botnet-based attacks are among the most important security vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Most of the existing research approaches use centralized defense mechanisms to prevent DDoS attacks in IoT environments. However, it is important to provide a reliable and scalable solution to prevent DDoS attacks. Combining technologies such as distributed blockchain-based mechanisms and smart contracts facilitates the construction of a trusted distributed framework that can defend against DDoS attacks in IoT. In this article, we have proposed a multilevel DDoS mitigation approach (ML-DDoS) to protect IoT devices and other computing resources or machines using the blockchain-based framework. The core concept of the proposed system is to use a device-based verification mechanism using blockchain and exclude malicious devices from IoT environments. The proposed framework was developed using Hyperledger Caliper (a blockchain benchmark tool) and its performance was evaluated using three benchmark applications. Compared to the state of the art, the results show that the proposed framework achieves up to 35% improvement in throughput, up to 40% improvement in latency, and up to 25% better utilization of CPU.	internet of things;denial-of-service attack;servers;computer crime;blockchains;smart homes;business;artificial intelligence;attacks;blockchain;cybersecurity;distributed denial of service (ddos);internet of things (iot)security;internet
1776	技术治理	BMP: An Evaluation System for Bitcoin Mining Pools	With the in-depth research and cross-domain applications of blockchain in various industries, blockchain mining attracts great attention. A comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of mining pool is essential to the Bitcoin network supervision as well as the reduction of carbon emission. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining mining pool internal data, the current evaluation is limited to a single mining power indicator. In this article, we build a four-layer mining pool evaluation model, named BMP, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The model contains three first-level indicators and nine second-level indicators, covering various aspects of the performance of mining pool. Miner address extraction provides basic data for the calculation of these indicators. By utilizing the model proposed, we evaluated and ranked eight mainstream mining pools, which broadcasted 71.69% of the blocks during the period January 1, 2021-July 31, 2021. Through comparative analysis of evaluation result, we find that the 65% decline of mining power in June did not pose a threat to the stability of Bitcoin system. In addition, we also revealed the reasons for various fluctuations.	data mining;bitcoin;blockchains;stability criteria;distribution networks;carbon dioxide;analytical models;bitcoin miner;blockchain mining;evaluation model;transaction datavisual analytics;blockchain;selection

In this paper, we investigate the hedge and safe haven property of a wide range of clean energy indices against two distinct types of cryptocurrencies based on their energy consumption levels, termed "dirty"and "clean". Statistical evidence shows that clean energy is not a direct hedge for either of types. However, it serves as at least a weak safe haven for both in extreme bearish markets. Moreover, clean energy is more likely to be a safe haven for dirty cryptocurrencies than clean cryptocurrencies during increased uncertainty. We further study the spillover patterns among clean energy, cryptocurrency, stock, and gold markets. Weak connectedness is found between clean energy and cryptocurrencies which implies the potential use of clean energy as a hedge and diversification tool for cryptocurrencies in the future.	cryptocurrencies;clean energy;safe haven;spillovers;connectedness;dcc-garchsafe haven;dynamic connectedness;bitcoin;volatility;spillovers;hedge;integration;assets;market;return

In doing so, we contribute to a growing literature that aims to understand the value of digital assets as investments. The main empirical results support the argument that cryptocurrency funds generate significantly positive alphas compared to passive benchmarks or conventional risk factors. To understand whether the fund managers have sufficient skills to more than cover their costs, we compare the actual fund alphas against the simulated values from a panel semi-parametric bootstrap approach. The analysis shows that the extreme outperformance is unlikely to be explained by the luck of fund managers. However, the significance of the alphas becomes statistically weaker after considering the cross-sectional correlation in fund returns. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

1780	实体经济	GAP-MM: 5G-Enabled Real-Time Autonomous Vehicle Platoon Membership Management Based on Blockchain	Autonomous Vehicle Platoon (AVP) is the most anticipated application of 5G ultrareliable and low latency communications. By joining the preexisting platoon to form the real-time AVP (RAVP), individual vehicles could gain benefits such as fuel consumption reduction and traffic safety enhancement. Unlike the scheduled AVP which only contains fixed vehicles, members in RAVP change frequently since individual vehicles would want to join or leave the platoon any time. Besides, malicious vehicles may attempt to sneak into the RAVP and try to manipulate the platoon. Public key cryptography and access control mechanisms can be adopted to create a relatively isolated area for communication inside the platoon. Nevertheless, there exist few works that take into account the regulation of the dynamic change members in RAVP. In this paper, we propose a membership management scheme for 5G-enabled RAVP by integrating revocable attribute-based encryption (RABE) and blockchain, namely, GAP-MM. It realizes fine-grained access control of key distribution and malicious vehicle's key revocation efficiently. The sufficient evaluations and security analysis indicate that GAP-MM is practical for RAVP scenario in terms of both efficiency and security.	enabled internet;communication
1781	协同技术	BEAT: Blockchain-Enabled Accountable and Transparent Infrastructure Sharing in 6G and Beyond	It is widely expected that future networks of 6G and beyond will substantially improve on 5G. Technologies such as Internet of Skills and Industry 4.0 will become stable and viable, as a direct consequence of networks that offer sustained and reliable mobile performance levels. The primary challenges for future technologies are not just low-latency and high-bandwidth. The more critical problem Mobile Service Providers (MSPs) will face will be in balancing the inflated demands of network connections and customers' trust in the network service. That is, being able to interconnect billions of unique devices while adhering to the agreed terms of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To meet these targets, it is self-evident that MSPs cannot operate in a solitary environment. They must enable cooperation among themselves in a manner that ensures trust, both between themselves as well as with customers. In this study, we present the BEAT (Blockchain-Enabled Accountable and Transparent) Infrastructure Sharing architecture. BEAT exploits the inherent properties of permissioned type of distributed ledger technology (i.e., permissioned distributed ledgers) to deliver on accountability and transparency metrics whenever infrastructure needs to be shared between providers. We also propose a lightweight method that enables device-level accountability. BEAT has been designed to be deployable directly as only minor software upgrades to network devices such as routers. Our simulations on a resource-limited device show that BEAT adds only a few seconds of overhead processing time - with the latest state-of-the-art network devices, we can reasonably anticipate much lower overheads.	distributed ledger;resource management;smart contracts;internet;blockchains;5g mobile communication;6g mobile communication;infrastructure sharing;smart contracts;permissioned distributed ledgersnetwork;5g;governance;management;service
1782	协同技术	Cloud Storage Data Access Control Scheme Based on Blockchain and Attribute-Based Encryption	Cloud storage is a popular model of the application in various fields, and the security of storage data and access permission have been widely considered. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) provides fine-grained user access control and ensures data confidentiality. However, current ABE access control schemes rely on trusted cloud servers and provide a low level of security. To solve these problems of traditional encryption schemes, we propose a blockchain-based and ABE cloud storage data access control scheme. In this article, blockchain and smart contract technology are the core elements to ensure data integrity and build a decentralized verification method for outsourcing results. This application can minimize the reliance on servers in the cloud environment. Based on the ciphertext-policy ABE algorithm, the proposed scheme supports a hidden access policy to avoid the risk of privacy leakage. In addition, we adopt outsourcing technology and predetected decryption algorithms to reduce the computational overhead of local and outsourced servers. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that our proposed scheme has high computational efficiency and satisfies the condition of indistinguishability under the chosen-ciphertext attacks.

IIoT is connecting enormous devices in industry 4.0/5.0 which may be heterogeneous in nature. With the evolution of IoT, diverse technologies have been employed to deliver the quality of services to the end users in a seamless manner. Cloud computing has considerably boosted the growth of IIoT by serving the computational and data storage needs of IIoT- and blockchain-based applications in industry 4.0/5.0. However, cloud is providing services to IIoT users, but still, there is a need to improve the latency rate of delivery of services, the transmission rate of end-to-end delivery, and overall throughput of the network channels in industry 4.0 and blockchain-based distributed systems. The cloud servers those are located at remote locations are not capable to offer the quality of services to users who require real-time responses, minimum network latency, and optimum throughput. The advancements in Edge computing are making Edge-Cloud more suitable for end users in blockchain-based transactions and industry 4.0 to serve the requirements of IIoT-based applications. This paper aims at providing the resources of Edge-Cloud to the end users by proposing a soft-computing technique for selecting the most suitable resources from the pool of available resources at Edge-Cloud. This paper is proposing a multicriteria statistical approach for resource selection to exploit the benefits of Edge-Cloud and to suffice the needs of IIoT and blockchain-based applications in industry 4.0.

1784	虚拟经济	The actualization of meta affordances: Conceptualizing affordance actualization in the metaverse games1	Drawing on the theory of affordance, we conceptualize affordance actualization for the metaverse games (MG) relative to the affordances of internalized and embodied experiences by users. Focusing on MG players' affordances, we examine how they affect the user experience by exploring how affordances are realized and enacted in an extended environment. Based on mixed methods of empirical analysis, we identify relevant affordances, theorize affordance actualization, and characterize the duality of affordance in the metaverse. A heuristic process of immersion and selection of affordances through underlying cues together actualize a player's sensory representations of affective affordances. By identifying how extended reality mediates interactions with users, we contribute to prescriptive knowledge in the form of theoretical considerations and practical implications intended for academics and practitioners working in the context of the extended environment. We propose that affordance actualization helps to theorize the duality of affordance in the metaverse that users shape their metaverse based on their actualized affordance, and at the same time, the metaverse becomes a part of the structure shaping and constraining user actions.	metaverse;extended reality;affordance actualization;enactive interaction;affordance process;the duality of metaverse;embodied cognitionvirtual environments;reality;framework;impact;work
1785	虚拟经济	Enhancing the Prediction of User Satisfaction with Metaverse Service Through Machine Learning	Metaverse is one of the main technologies in the daily lives of several people, such as education, tour systems, and mobile application ser-vices. Particularly, the number of users of mobile metaverse applications is increasing owing to the merit of accessibility everywhere. To provide an improved service, it is important to analyze online reviews that contain user satisfaction. Several previous studies have utilized traditional methods, such as the structural equation model (SEM) and technology acceptance method (TAM) for exploring user satisfaction, using limited survey data. These meth-ods may not be appropriate for analyzing the users of mobile applications. To overcome this limitation, several researchers perform user experience analysis through online reviews and star ratings. However, some online reviews occasionally have inconsistencies between the star rating and the sentiment of the text. This variation disturbs the performance of machine learning. To alle-viate the inconsistencies, Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER), which is a sentiment classifier based on lexicon, is introduced. The current study aims to build a more accurate sentiment classifier based on machine learning with VADER. In this study, five sentiment classifiers are used, such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Categorical boosting algorithm (Catboost) with three embedding methods (Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Word2Vec). The results show that classifiers that apply VADER outperform those that do not apply VADER, excluding one classifier (Logistic Regression with Word2Vec). Moreover, LightGBM with TF-IDF has the highest accuracy 88.68% among other models.	metaverse;ubiquitous computing;user satisfaction;online review;big data;vader;machine learning;natural language processingonline
1786	协同技术	Multiparty Data Publishing via Blockchain and Differential Privacy	Data are distributed between different parties. Collecting data from multiple parties for analysis and mining will serve people better. However, it also brings unprecedented privacy threats to the participants. Therefore, safe and reliable data publishing among multiple data owners is an urgent problem to be solved. We mainly study the problem of privacy protection in data publishing. For a centralized scenario, we propose the LDA-DP algorithm. First, the within-class mean vectors and the pooled within-class scatter matrix are perturbed by the Gaussian noise. Second, the optimal projection direction vector with differential privacy is obtained by the Fisher criterion. Finally, the low-dimensional projection data of the original data are obtained. For distributed scenarios, we propose the Mul-LDA-DP algorithm based on a blockchain and differential privacy technology. First, the within-class mean vectors and within-class scatter matrices of local data are perturbed by the Gaussian noise and uploaded to the blockchain network. Second, the projection direction vector is calculated in the blockchain network and returned to the data owner. Finally, the data owner uses the projection direction vector to generate low-dimensional projection data of the original data and upload it to the blockchain network for publishing. Furthermore, in a distributed scenario, we propose a correlated noise generation scheme that uses the additivity of the Gaussian distribution to mitigate the effects of noise and can achieve the same noise level as the centralized scenario. We measure the utility of the published data by the SVM misclassification rate. We conduct comparative experiments with similar algorithms on different real data sets. The experimental results show that the data released by the two algorithms can maintain good utility in SVM classification.	data release
1787	实体经济	Privacy-preserving COVID-19 contact tracing solution based on blockchain	The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected daily life and caused a great loss to the global economy. Due to the very urgent need for identifying close contacts of confirmed patients in the current situation, the development of automated contact tracing app for smart devices has attracted more attention all over the world. Compared with expensive manual tracing approach, automated contact tracing apps can offer fast and precise tracing service, however, over-pursing high efficiency would lead to the privacy-leaking issue for app users. By combing with the benign properties (e.g., anonymity, decentralization, and traceability) of blockchain, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving solution in automated tracing scenario. Our main technique is a com-bination of non-interactive zero-knowledge proof and multi-signature with public key aggregation. By means of aggregating multiple signatures from different contacts at the mutual commitment phase, we only need fewer zero-knowledge proofs to complete the task of identifying contacts. It inherently leads to the benefits of saving storage and consuming less time for running verification algorithm on blockchain. Furthermore, we perform an experimental comparison by timing the execution of signature verification with and without aggregate signature, respectively. It shows that our solution can actually preserve the full-fledged privacy protection property with a lower computational cost.	blockchain;privacy-preserving contact tracing;covid-19;zero-knowledge proof;aggregate signaturesignatures;security;internet

We developed a blockchain-based dynamic consent platform named METORY tailored for clinical trials.

1789	实体经济	Secure Model for IoT Healthcare System under Encrypted Blockchain Framework	With the advancements in the new technologies like IoT, the healthcare sector is also growing rapidly. The core concept of introducing IoT in the healthcare centers is to make it remotely accessible, so that communication between doctor and patient can be easy, and diagnosis of any disease can be remotely done through the Internet in case of emergency. The major objective of this study is to develop a security framework for the healthcare industry that can encrypt secret data on cloud servers using block-based data encoding. Since any information that is available on the Internet is vulnerable to various attacks, and the medical records of the patients carry sensitive information that must not be accessible to any unauthorized or unauthentic person, in this context, the concept of Blockchain (BC) technology was introduced in the healthcare systems. In the past few years, a number of BC based healthcare models were proposed in the system; however, these systems are decentralized in nature, which is a feature of Blockchain technology, but in certain applications, especially in healthcare, this feature gave rise to a problem termed as disease overlapping when the count of chains gets increased. To solve this issue, a BC based framework is used in this work that has a feature of creating a separate block in the chain every time whenever any alteration in information about patient's health, any allergies, new symptoms, medications, etc. is updated. In addition to this, securing the sensitive information of patients is taken into consideration by developing an improved and enhanced multilayer Blockchain based IoT data security approach that not only protects the data, but also builds the trust between patients/user and healthcare service providers. The main focused area of this research article is to propose a security framework for healthcare domain that can encrypt the confidential data over cloud server under block-based data encoding. In the proposed approach, 128-bit AES key is generated in order to support the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Individual user's data is subdivided to blocks and encrypted to secure it from unauthorized access. An interface-based system is designed to present the real-world usage of the proposed model in healthcare application. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated in the MATLAB software in terms of MAE, RMSE, MSE, encryption time, and decryption time. The RSA and DSA are the most trending encryption algorithms. These algorithms are crucial components of Blockchain technology, implemented in the proposed work, and later on, their performances are also compared with each other to check their effectiveness. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed encrypting algorithm surpasses the other encryption approaches such as RSA and DSA in all factors to prove its supremacy. The experimental results show that the encryption and decryption time are lowest in the proposed framework; therefore, its performance is more effective and robust. It is also more effective and resilient.	
1790	协同技术	CWoT-Share: Context-Based Web of Things Resource Sharing in Blockchain Environment	Web of Things (WoT) resources are not only numerous, but also have a wide range of applications and deployments. The centralized WoT resource sharing mechanism lacks flexibility and scalability, and hence cannot satisfy requirement of distributed resource sharing in large-scale environment. In response to this problem, a trusted and secure mechanism for WoT resources sharing based on context and blockchain (CWoT-Share) was proposed. Firstly, the mechanism can respond quickly to the changes of the application environment by dynamically determining resource access control rules according to the context. Then, the flexible resource charging strategies, which reduced the fees paid by the users who shared more resources and increased the fees paid by users who frequently used resources maliciously, were used to fulfill efficient sharing of WoT resources. Meanwhile, the charging strategies also achieve load balancing by dynamic selection of WoT resources. Finally, the open source blockchain platform Ethereum was used for the simulation and the simulation results show that CWoT-Share can flexibly adapt to the application environment and dynamically adjust strategies of resource access control and resource charging.	web of things;resource sharing;smart contract;context;billing strategyinternet;iot;architecture;framework
1791	市场治理	Comparison of Price-Volume Correlation for Some Cryptocurrencies Based on MF-ADCCA	In this paper, we explored the price-volume cross-correlation asymmetric multifractal properties of some cryptocurrencies using multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-ADCCA). Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Cardano, and Dogecoin are examples of cryptocurrencies. The empirical results reveal that the price-volume cross-correlations of all six cryptocurrencies display anti-persistent, multifractal, and asymmetric features, although the degree of these characteristics differs depending on the cryptocurrencies and market trends. Specifically, the anti-persistence multifractal of the price-volume cross-correlation is significantly stronger in the upward market than in the downward market for Bitcoin and Ethereum; for the remaining four cryptocurrencies, the opposite result is obtained. Furthermore, Dogecoin price-volume cross-correlation exhibits the most marked anti-persistence and the most significant asymmetric multifractality among the six cryptocurrencies analyzed.	cryptocurrency;price-volume;dcca coefficient;mf-adccacross-correlations;chinese
1792	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based Framework for Secure Storage and Sharing of Resumes	In response to problems in the centralized storage of personal resumes on third-party recruitment platforms, such as inadequate privacy protection, inability of individuals to accurately authorize downloads, and inability to determine who downloaded the resume and when, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for secure storage and sharing of resumes. Users can employ an authorized access mechanism to protect their privacy rights. The proposed framework uses smart contracts, interplanetary file system, symmetric encryption, and digital signatures to protect, verify, and share resumes. Encryption keys are split and stored in multiple depositories through secret-sharing technology to improve the security of these keys. Corresponding key escrow incentives are implemented using smart contracts to automatically verify the correctness of keys and encourage the active participation of honest key escrow parties. This framework combines blockchain and searchable symmetric encryption technology to realize multi keyword search using inverted indexing and Bloom filters and verify search results on the chain. Escrow search service fees are charged through contracts. Only after the search results are verified can the search service provider obtain the search fee, thus ensuring fair and efficient search for encrypted resumes. The framework is decentralized, secure, and tamper-evident, and achieves controlled sharing while protecting personal privacy and information security.	resume;blockchain;interplanetary file system;secret sharing;searchable encryptionencryption
1793	实体经济	A patent registration and trading system based on blockchain	The traditional process of patent registration and trading is very complex, often hindered by challenges related to information security and patent traceability. As a popular emergent technology, blockchain has several useful characteristics such as tamper proof, distributed data management, timestamp, asymmetric encryption, and smart contract. Built upon these characteristics, this paper develops a patent registration and trading system for improved information security, immutability, transparency, and traceability. This system includes functions of patent registration and storage, patent trading, user privacy protection during patent registration and trading process, and overall data access control. To validate the applicability of the proposed system, this paper builds a blockchain environment to simulate a patent registration and trading process. We further conduct a security analysis and an efficiency analysis to compare the proposed patent registration and trading process with the traditional process. Through these comparisons we show that the proposed blockchain-aided patent registration and trading system is effective in resolving several key patent protection challenges. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed to highlight the significance of our proposed method.	blockchain technology;patent registration;patent trading;patent protection;traceability;smart contracttraceability;copyright
1794	虚拟经济	Improving the Application of Blockchain Technology for Financial Security in Supply Chain Integrated Business Intelligence	For major organizations, establishing financial shared service centers to unify the financial activities of entities in multiple countries and regions for bookkeeping and reporting has become the trend for financial and management optimization. Based on this, this paper selects security company A as a case study, introduces the emerging blockchain technology (BCT) as the core and embeds it into the concept of financial shared center, tries to explore a new model of financial shared service model under BCT from the theoretical perspective, and optimizes the original service model by improving its business process, creating visualized, supervisible, and traceable financial data processing capability, and expanding. This paper first examines the financial shared service model of Company A. This paper starts with the actual situation of Company A's financial shared service model. Complex procedures, highly centralized information, unreasonable division of labor in corporate processes, and a lack of adequate information communication methods are discovered through process analysis. New requirements for accountants have emerged in the digital age, and the security protection of private keys in asymmetric encryption algorithms in organizations, particularly in large and medium-sized enterprises, must be done well.	
1795	实体经济	A Lamus-Based Flight Data Sharing Model on Consortium Blockchain	Currently, traditional flight data sharing models cannot resist quantum attacks, which poses the risk of data leakage. The research on the flight data sharing model against quantum attack has become one of the research hotspots. Lattice-based cryptography is recognized as an effective way to resist quantum attacks. A flight data sharing model on consortium blockchain is proposed in this paper to resolve data leakage during data sharing. First, a new lattice-based multisignature scheme (Lamus) is proposed, capable of resisting quantum attacks. We prove the security of the proposed Lamus scheme in the random oracle model. Moreover, a flight data sharing model on consortium blockchain is proposed by applying the proposed Lamus scheme to resist quantum attacks. Security and performance analysis show that the model guarantees antiquantum security, and it achieves good performance in terms of storage efficiency and operating efficiency.	
1796	实体经济	PADaaV: Blockchain-Based Parking Price Prediction Scheme for Sustainable Traffic Management	In most countries, traffic congestion has reached a level where managing traffic is tedious for regulatory bodies. The traffic management faced many issues such as route routing based on congestion, delivery of messages/emails to end-users, and real-time allocation of parking slots. There have been many works on predicting parking prices for traffic management, but most favor users or owners and are not secure. To address these issues, a blockchain and Interplanetary File System (IPFS)-based parking price prediction scheme (PADaaV) is proposed to facilitate the users to reserve a parking slot securely and efficiently. It mainly focuses on ensuring security, privacy, and transparency for parking slot owners and users. Furthermore, we employ a second price auction model to optimize the parking price for users, and parking slot owners can also get benefit from it. The performance of the PADaaV has been simulated for 100 users with 40 parking slots based on different auction models. The various performance parameters considered are profit for users, profit for parking slot owners, overall revenue of the system, scalability, computation time, and data storage cost. The performance results show that the PADaaV is secure and beneficial for users and parking slot owners.	security;blockchains;smart contracts;costs;memory;electronic mail;traffic congestion;blockchain;smart contracts;second price auction model;traffic managementmodel
1797	核心技术	A Practical Heartbeat-based Defense Scheme Against Cloning Attacks in PoA Blockchain	Consensus mechanism, as the soul-building-block of decentralized settings, enables a series of blockchain applications, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. For better security and soundness, more and more blockchain systems tend to adopt proof-of-authority (PoA) to avoid or alleviate the various security risks caused by their peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. However, the PoA protocol is also vulnerable to cloning attack (CA), which provides a potential pathway for double-spending attack and has not been well solved. In this paper, we propose a heartbeat-based defense scheme to achieve an effective CA detection in PoA blockchians. To this end, we first analyze two PoA algorithms, Aura and Clique, along with their CA. On this basis, we propose a heartbeat-based defense scheme that can detect CA effectively regardless of the underlying consensus algorithm of the blockchain. Then, to avoid the potential efficiency reduction caused by the increase of sealers, we further design an enhanced hierarchical node selection algorithm, in which sealers can challenge partial nodes selected randomly according our strategy to detect CA in an efficient manner. Finally, we theoretically estimate the precision rate model of our scheme and then establish a prototype PoA blockchain system to test the performance of our scheme. As expected, the experiment results are consistent with our theoretical analysis, which powerfully demonstrates the efficiency and practicability of the proposed scheme.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;proof of authority;cloning attack;heartbeat-based defense scheme;hierarchy node selection
1798	核心技术	A decentralized autonomous personal data management system in banking sector	The present security systems encounter vulnerable surveillance and protection breaches in financial domains day by day. These systems compromise the privacy of the users in such a way that their personal data are collected and controlled by the third-parties. In this regard, Bitcoin has been implemented in the financial space. It has made possible the trusted and auditable computing via decentralized network associated with a public ledger. This work proposes a decentralized personal data management system for banking sector using block chain which makes sure that the user can control their personal data in their own .It presents a Privacy-Protected Blockchain network in which all data is encoded within a controlled time period. Despite the fact that the data is available in the past, this design can successfully preserve user privacy and protect from deceivers, providing the data more stable and healthier. Blockchain has its advantages over features such as transparency, decentralization and immutability. In the proposed model, a protocol is implemented which converts the blockchain into automated access control manager. There is no need for a third party to be trusted for the implementation of this model. In the proposed system, the transactions are not limited to financial transactions like Bitcoin, it also includes data storing, sharing and querying. Hence, the use of blockchain could reduce the overly concern about securing and compartmentalizing the data.	blockchain;bitcoin;personal data;privacy;securityblockchain
1799	技术治理	A Large-scale Empirical Analysis of Ransomware Activities in Bitcoin	Exploiting the anonymous mechanism of Bitcoin, ransomware activities demanding ransom in bitcoins have become rampant in recent years. Several existing studies quantify the impact of ransomware activities, mostly focusing on the amount of ransom. However, victims' reactions in Bitcoin that can well reflect the impact of ransomware activities are somehow largely neglected. Besides, existing studies track ransom transfers at the Bitcoin address level, making it difficult for them to uncover the patterns of ransom transfers from a macro perspective beyond Bitcoin addresses. In this article, we conduct a large-scale analysis of ransom payments, ransom transfers, and victim migrations in Bitcoin from 2012 to 2021. First, we develop a fine-grained address clustering method to cluster Bitcoin addresses into users, which enables us to identify more addresses controlled by ransomware criminals. Second, motivated by the fact that Bitcoin activities and their participants already formed stable industries, such as Darknet and Miner, we train a multi-label classification model to identify the industry identifiers of users. Third, we identify ransom payment transactions and then quantify the amount of ransom and the number of victims in 63 ransomware activities. Finally, after we analyze the trajectories of ransom transferred across different industries and track victims' migrations across industries, we find out that to obscure the purposes of their transfer trajectories, most ransomware criminals (e.g., operators of Locky and Wannacry) prefer to spread ransom into multiple industries instead of utilizing the services of Bitcoin mixers. Compared with other industries, Investment is highly resilient to ransomware activities in the sense that the number of users in Investment remains relatively stable. Moreover, we also observe that a few victims become active in the Darknet after paying ransom. Our findings in this work can help authorities deeply understand ransomware activities in Bitcoin. While our study focuses on ransomware, our methods are potentially applicable to other cybercriminal activities that have similarly adopted bitcoins as their payments.	bitcoin transactions;clustering;ransomwarevictimization;overlap
1800	实体经济	A Study on Resource Security under Legal Protection of e-Commerce Data Sovereignty Based on Blockchain Network	With the growing demand for cross-border electronic data forensics, national sovereignty and international network security have ushered in great challenges, and how to achieve dynamic balance in various fields under cross-border electronic data forensics, advance the process of global cyberspace governance, reach international consensus, and achieve win-win cooperation is a question that China needs to solve. Based on the above status quo, a blockchain-based secure e-commerce system is researched and implemented. Using the distributed architecture of the blockchain system and the automatic execution feature of smart contracts, a secure transaction application system is designed to realize decentralization and solve the problem of untrustworthy intermediate parties. Data storage is based on the mechanism of combining blockchain and offchain databases to ensure data security, and the characteristic of blockchain can only be appended and read to prevent the system from being tampered. The database index and the storage structure of smart contract commodity information and transaction information are established to improve the query efficiency. The functional and performance tests of the system show that the transaction processing efficiency is high in the multinode environment, and the response time of order and commodity status query can reach 80 ms. The design and development process of the system is introduced in detail, which is an important reference value for the application of blockchain technology in e-commerce.	china
1801	核心技术	Smart Contract Generation Assisted by AI-Based Word Segmentation	In the last decade, blockchain smart contracts emerged as an automated, decentralized, traceable, and immutable medium of value exchange. Nevertheless, existing blockchain smart contracts are not compatible with legal contracts. The automatic execution of a legal contract written in natural language is an open research question that can extend the blockchain ecosystem and inspire next-era business paradigms. In this paper, we propose an AI-assisted Smart Contract Generation (AIASCG) framework that allows contracting parties in heterogeneous contexts and different languages to collaboratively negotiate and draft the contract clauses. AIASCG provides a universal representation of contracts through the machine natural language (MNL) as the common understanding of the contract obligations. We compare the design of AIASCG with existing smart contract generation approaches to present its novelty. The main contribution of AIASCG is to address the issue in our previous proposed smart contract generation framework. For sentences written in natural language, existing framework requires editors to manually split sentences into words with semantic meaning. We propose an AI-based automatic word segmentation technique called Separation Inference (SpIn) to fulfill automatic split of the sentence. SpIn serves as the core component in AIASCG that accurately recommends the intermediate MNL outputs from a natural language sentence, tremendously reducing the manual effort in contract generation. SpIn is evaluated from a robustness and human satisfaction point of view to demonstrate its effectiveness. In the robustness evaluation, SpIn achieves state-of-the-art F1 scores and Recall of Out-of-Vocabulary (R_OOV) words on multiple word segmentation tasks. In addition, in the human evaluation, participants believe that 88.67% of sentences can be saved 80-100% of the time through automatic word segmentation.	smart contract;collaborative drafting;semantic understanding;automatic word segmentationchallenges;systems
1802	协同技术	Authorization schemes for internet of things: requirements, weaknesses, future challenges and trends	Scalable and secure authorization of smart things is of the crucial essence for the successful deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT). Unauthorized access to smart things could exacerbate the security and privacy concern, which could, in turn, lead to the reduced adoption of the IoT, and ultimately to the emergence of severe threats. Even though there are a variety of IoT solutions for secure authorization, authorization schemes in highly dynamic distributed environments remain a daunting challenge. Access rights can dynamically change due to the heterogeneous nature of shared IoT devices and, thus, the identity and access control management are challenging. This survey provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of the current state-of-the-art IoT authorization schemes to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Then, it defines the most important requirements and highlights the authorization threats and weaknesses impacting authorization in the IoT. Finally, the survey presents the ongoing open authorization challenges and provides recommendations for future research.	access control;security threat;security attacksaccess-control scheme;efficient authentication;sensor networks;security model;iot;blockchain;privacy;context;architecture;framework
1803	实体经济	Blockchain for SME Clusters: An Ideation using the Framework of Ostrom Commons Governance	Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) organize themselves into clusters by sharing a set of limited resources to achieve the holistic success of the cluster. However, these SMEs often face conflicts and deadlock situations that hinder the fundamental operational dynamics of the cluster due to varied reasons, including lack of trust and transparency in interactions, lack of common consensus, and lack of accountability and non-repudiation. Blockchain technology brings trust, transparency, and traceability to systems, as demonstrated by previous research and practice. In this paper, we explore the role of blockchain technology in building a trustworthy yet collaborative environment in SME clusters through the principles of community self-governance based on the work of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom. We develop and present a blockchain commons governance framework for the three main dimensions i.e., interaction, autonomy, and control, based on the theoretical premise of equivalence mapping and qualitative analysis. This paper examines the role of blockchain technology to act as a guiding mechanism and support the smooth functioning of SMEs for their holistic good. The study focuses on sustainability and improving productivity of SMEs operating in clusters under public and private partnership. This is the first study to address the operational challenges faced by SEMs in clusters by highlighting the dimensions of blockchain commons governance dimensions.	blockchain;small- and medium-sized enterprises (smes);self-governance of communities;technology assessment;clusters;blockchain technology;blockchain governanceknowledge;networks;chain;technology;innovation;interview;resource;success;models;time
1804	实体经济	Analysis of Farmers' Willingness to Use Blockchain and Influencing Factors Based on the Binary Logit Model	Blockchain is the frontier of modern science and technology, and promoting its application in agriculture is of great significance to agricultural development. Taking the farmers who are essential agricultural subjects as the research object, this paper applies the binary Logit model to investigate the farmers' willingness to apply blockchain and its influencing factors. Based on rigorous analyses of research data and models, the main research conclusions are obtained. First, at the current stage, Chinese farmers are not very receptive to the blockchain, most of whom are unwilling to apply it to agricultural production and operation. Second, farmers' age and participation in agricultural training exert a remarkable negative impact on their willingness to apply blockchain. Third, the education level of farmers, the highest education level of their family, the annual income of crops per mu, government subsidies, the application of agricultural information technology, and the degree of their understanding of blockchain impose a remarkable positive impact on their willingness to apply blockchain. According to the analysis results, the following suggestions are put forward: (1) strengthen education and training to improve farmers' understanding of blockchain; (2) strengthen financial support and provide equipment subsidies and tax relief for farmers who apply blockchain; and (3) implement demonstration projects and take the lead in applying blockchain by supporting family farms, large planters, and other agricultural business entities with demonstration effects.	agriculture;technology;system

Then, from the perspective of risk, combined with analytic hierarchy process, an index system for reasonable evaluation of distribution network fault benchmark risk is established. Quantitative assessment and risk classification shall be carried out for the failure probability, failure impact consequence, and comprehensive failure risk, so as to facilitate the adoption of risk response measures. Finally, taking several 220 kV lines in the northwest and central part of a city as examples, the icing prediction analysis verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed power grid disaster early warning decision system based on blockchain to predict the icing thickness. The experimental results show that taking the icing disaster as an example, the MPC method is used to modify the icing thickness prediction model, improve the accuracy of the icing prediction model, and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the prediction and early warning system based on blockchain.	
1806	实体经济	A mapping review of literature on Blockchain usage by libraries: Challenges and opportunities	The Library and Information Science (LIS) community has started discussing some possible uses of Blockchain (BC) technologies in solving library-related problems and increasing the overall efficiency of libraries. This study aimed to systematically collect and review the relevant literature to comprehend the scope of BC for libraries, its benefits, as well as the challenges, and implications related to its use. The authors explored six reputed databases (Web of Science, Scopus, LISTA (Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts), LISA (Library and Information Science Abstracts), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), and Google Scholar) to conduct this review. This study was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After the final data extraction, 21 documents were considered eligible for the systematic review. A systematic review of the selected works indicated that the usage of BC in libraries ranged from record-keeping to processing payments and ensuring security and transparency. Some of the opportunities that can be hunted from BC were the elimination of corruption, enhanced security, improved efficiency of services, and better time management. Literature also indicated that a lack of awareness of technology, unskilled staff, and financial constraints could impede the adoption of BC by libraries. It is hoped that this study would provide a holistic overview of BC technologies for libraries, thus improving the effectiveness of the decision-makers. This study is first that collected (systematically) and reviewed the literature on BC usage in libraries. The review will help educational institutions and library professionals understand the usage, challenges, and benefits of BC for libraries.	blockchain in libraries;record keeping;security;financial management;resource sharing;systematic literature reviewtechnology;information;service;impact

1808	虚拟经济	BlockGraph: a scalable secure distributed ledger that exploits locality	Distributed public ledgers, the key to modern cryptocurrencies and the heart of many novel applications, have scalability problems. Ledgers such as the blockchain underlying Bitcoin can process fewer than 10 transactions per second (TPS). The cost of transactions is high, and the time to confirm a transaction is in the minutes. We present the BlockGraph, a scalable distributed public ledger inspired by principles of computer architecture. The BlockGraph exploits the natural locality of transactions to allow publishing independent transactions in parallel. It extends the blockchain with three new transactions to create a unified consistent ledger out of essentially independent blockchains. The most important change is the introduction of the blockstamp transaction, which essentially checkpoints a local blockchain and secures it against attack. The result is a locality-based, simple, secure, sharding protocol which keeps all transactions readable. This paper introduces the BlockGraph protocol, proves that it is consistent and can achieve many thousands of TPS. Using our implementation (a small extension to Bitcoin core) we demonstrate that it, in practice, can significantly improve throughput.	public ledger;blockchain;performance and scalability;sharding
1809	核心技术	A novel game theory based reliable proof-of-stake consensus mechanism for blockchain	The prominent achievement of blockchain technology stimulates exceptional innovation. The major component of blockchain is the consensus mechanism. The standard consensus mechanisms specifically Proof-of-Work (PoW) rely on mining procedures and stake-based mechanisms such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS) rely on massive stake investment as the sole criteria for selection of leader nodes. However, PoW impose huge computational power requirements and latter may incorporate malicious nodes as leader nodes in anonymous blockchain. These issues might fuel the way for distrust among the participants in blockchain. Henceforth, a novel game theory based reliable PoS mechanism for blockchain has been proposed. Federated learning has been used to compute trust_score for each node. The nodes are trained on locally generated dataset. Further, a game theoretic approach has been proposed that uses a reward and punishment scheme to ensure threshold level of trust_score maintenance by each node. Finally, a crop insurance use case has been developed with the consensus mechanism and blockchain coded in python. The insurance claims are made to operate through smart contract based mobile app system to impart more authenticity. The system is tested and results show an intrusion accomplishment rate reduced by approximate 40% when compared to the standard PoS mechanism and by approximately 33% for algorand, 29% for ouroboros and 20% for tendermint. The mean absolute error also decreases by 30% within specific time. Furthermore, the proposed federated learning-based system is compared with basic neural network-based machine learning model and the results reveal that a significant reduction in average training time amounting to 8.35 second is achieved. Test accuracy has also been analyzed for various learning mechanisms.	blockchain;consensus mechanism;crop insurance;federated learning;game theorydelegated proof;opportunities;challenges;dpos
1810	核心技术	A novel reputation-based consensus framework (RCF) in distributed ledger technology	Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has emerged as a key and effective technology which has caught the attention of variety of disciplines and is capable of changing lots of sciences and related industries. Selecting the transactions of members in DLT-based technologies such as blockchain, especially in finance, is essential and vital. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel framework for selecting members' transactions through trust and reputation models called the reputation-based consensus framework (RCF), so that by combining trust and reputation models with blockchain, the target node (or verifier), which has the highest reputation based on its transactions history, is selected to create and publish the current block of blockchain. We have also provided a state machine model to accurately describe the behavior of the RCF. In addition, the RCF algorithms are presented and a prototype is developed based on it. The results of simulation and performance and security analysis proved that RCF leads to fair selection of transactions, improves scalability and throughput, and can resist against attacks such as Sybil and malicious behaviors.	distributed ledger technology;blockchain;consensus mechanisms;framework;trust and reputation modelsblockchain consensus;trust;security
1811	实体经济	Forensics chain for evidence preservation system: An evidence preservation forensics framework for internet of things-based smart city security using blockchain	In recent times, the new revolution of IoT facilitates communication and information sharing among people in different domains like a smart city. This revolution came with a risk of cyber-attacks that target devices and shared data. The digital evidence resulting from the digital forensics process applied to IoT devices must be kept safe for later analysis. Preserving digital evidence on a centralized server raises the risk of a single point of failure. Evidence preserving on cloud servers raises the tampering risk with the evidence or even sharing them with malicious third parties. Therefore, this paper presents a novel framework called Forensics Chain for Evidence Preservation System for IoT-based smart city security. The proposed framework aims to integrate blockchain with digital forensics to overcome the problems faced by forensic investigators; single point of failure and/or evidence modifications and enhance the security of preserving digital evidence via applying blockchain. Applying blockchain guarantees the immutability and data integrity of the preserved evidence. Furthermore, preserving the digital evidence among the forensic participant nodes eliminates the possibility of the single-point failure of a centralized storage server. The results provided a Proof of Concept for forensic evidence preservation based on blockchain and evaluated its performance.	blockchain;cybercrimes;cyber-security;digital evidence;digital forensics;evidence preservation;internet of things;intrusion detectionchallenges
1812	平台项目	BCSM: A BlockChain-based Security Manager for Big Data	The amount of data generated globally is increasing rapidly. This growth in big data poses security and privacy issues. Organizations that collect data from numerous sources could face legal or business consequences resulting from a security breach and the exposure of sensitive information. The traditional tools used for decades to handle, manage, and secure data are not suitable anymore in the case of big data. Furthermore, most of the current security tools rely on third-party services, which have numerous security problems. More research must investigate protecting user-sensitive information which can be abused and altered from several sides. Blockchain is a promising technology that provides decentralized backend infrastructure. Blockchain keeps track of transactions indefinitely and protects them from alteration. It provides a secure, tamper-proof database that may be used to track the past state of the system. In this paper, we present our big data security manager based on Hyperledger Fabric, which provides end-to-end big data security, including data storage, transmitting, and sharing as well as access control and auditing mechanisms. The manager components and modular architecture are illustrated. The metadata and permissions related to stored datasets are stored in the blockchain to be protected. Finally, we have tested the performance of our solution in terms of transaction throughput and average latency. The performance metrics are provided by Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmark tool for analyzing Hyperledger blockchain performance.	big data security;blockchain;access control;hyperledger fabricdesign
1813	核心技术	An SGX-based execution framework for smart contracts upon permissioned blockchain	Since consensus protocol and execution mechanism act as two key factors for the overall throughput of blockchain systems, how to execute smart contracts efficiently becomes an emergent bottleneck as many high-performance consensus protocols have been proposed in recent years. Due to the existence of Byzantine nodes, existing concurrency approaches can only achieve intra-node concurrency, not inter-node concurrency. Fortunately, since the trust among nodes can be achieved based on the confidentiality guarantee provided by the trusted execution environment, such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), we propose a novel concurrent execution framework using SGX, which is the first to achieve both intra- and inter-node concurrency. Specifically, each replica executes the task assigned by the primary in parallel and gets trusted results using SGX firstly. Then, each node obtains the execution results of others via state replication to achieve consistency. However, we must ensure the integrity and correctness of all data transferred to SGX for getting the trusted results. Therefore, we design a novel approach to efficiently generate Merkle multiproofs and verify data in parallel. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms state-of-art solutions.	blockchain;smart contract;concurrency;sgx
1814	实体经济	Analysis of critical success factors for blockchain technology implementation in healthcare sector	Purpose Recently, blockchain technology (BT) has resolved healthcare data management challenges. It helps healthcare providers automate medical records and mining to aid in data sharing and making more accurate diagnoses. This paper attempts to identify the critical success factors (CSFs) for successfully implementing BT in healthcare. Design/methodology/approach The paper is methodologically structured in four phases. The first phase leads to identifying success factors by reviewing the extant literature. In the second phase, expert opinions were solicited to authenticate the critical success factors required to implement BT in the healthcare sector. Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was employed to find the cause-and-effect relationship among the third phase's critical success factors. In phase 4, the authors resort to validating the final results and findings. Findings Based on the analysis, 21 CSFs were identified and grouped under six dimensions. After applying the DEMATEL technique, nine factors belong to the causal group, and the remaining 12 factors fall under the effect group. The top three influencing factors of blockchain technology implementation in the healthcare ecosystem are data transparency, track and traceability and government support, whereas; implementation cost was the least influential. Originality/value This study provides a roadmap and may facilitate healthcare professionals to overcome contemporary challenges with the help of BT.	blockchain technology;healthcare system;mcdm;dematel;critical success factors (csfs);dssdecision-making;supply chains;framework;industry;service;model;optimization;organization;selection;security
1815	实体经济	Advancing pharmacy and healthcare with virtual digital technologies	Digitalisation of the healthcare sector promises to revolutionise patient healthcare globally. From the different technologies, virtual tools including artificial intelligence, blockchain, virtual, and augmented reality, to name but a few, are providing significant benefits to patients and the pharmaceutical sector alike, ranging from improving access to clinicians and medicines, as well as improving real-time diagnoses and treatments. Indeed, it is envisioned that such technologies will communicate together in real-time, as well as with their physical counterparts, to create a large-scale, cyber healthcare system. Despite the significant benefits that virtual-based digital health technologies can bring to patient care, a number of challenges still remain, ranging from data security to acceptance within the healthcare sector. This review provides a timely account of the benefits and challenges of virtual health interventions, as well an outlook on how such technologies can be transitioned from research-focused towards real-world healthcare and pharmaceutical applications to transform treatment pathways for patients worldwide.

1816	协同技术	A Right Transfer Access Control Model of Internet of Things Based on Smart Contract	Sensor nodes play a crucial role in the promotion of development of Internet of Things (IoT). Through this transaction, RO defines access control policies in script form based on ABAC's access control model to grant access right. The identity of all users in the model is identified by address. This paper builds a more flexible right transfer access control model by means of combining the Attribute-Based Access Control model (ABAC) and blockchain technology. Owing to the characteristics of ABAC's attributes and right association, the massive problems of some sensor nodes can be solved. At the same time, for the sake of addressing the dynamic problems such as node access and right transfer, right transfer contract (TS) and access control contract (CS) are employed on the chain to ensure efficient and safe transmission of rights. To solve on-chain storage problems and ensure transparency of the operation, the idea of Rollup in Ethereum expansion is used to upload the final state of protocol policy and right exchange to the chain. Any user can know the policy and current right transfer status at any time. Finally, comparative and security analysis show that the model presented here can solve IoT devices' massive and dynamic problems more effectively and it is more secure than the traditional models.

1818	市场治理	The Drivers of the Behavioral Adoption Intention of BITCOIN Payment from the Perspective of Chinese Citizens	The bitcoin payment innovation has gained wider interest around the world, but its adoption among the general population has been a challenge. Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer technology works with no central authority or banks, and the transaction management and issuing of bitcoin is carried out collectively by the network. One major debate on bitcoin development and diffusion is the critical matter of nongovernment intervention through adequate policy and regulatory framework and thus hinders people's active participation (acceptance) in the bitcoin market. Consequently, this study is purposed to examine the role government policy and regulations (moderating impact) can have in driving the acceptance of bitcoin payment from the Chinese perspective. The UTAUT was used as the theoretical basis from which a model was developed for testing. The structural equation model (SEM) through the use of SmartPLS was employed to undertake the analysis. The results have demonstrated that government regulation moderates (significant) the influence of both performance expectancy and infrastructure support on the behavioral acceptance of bitcoin payment. However, government regulation contrary to expectations was not significant in moderating the influence of effort expectancy (EE) and security on the acceptance of bitcoin payments. Additionally, the study discovered that performance expectancy, security, EE, and infrastructure support were significant in encouraging bitcoin behavioral adoption. The practical and theoretical implications of these findings on the development and diffusion of bitcoin technology systems are dissected meticulously.	common method bias;blockchain security;unified theory;utaut model;pls-sem;technology;acceptance;metaanalysis;convenience;markets
1819	市场治理	Bitcoin in Portfolio Selection: A Multivariate Distribution Approach	This study presents a multivariate study regarding Bitcoin and its interactions with other financial assets of different classes. This is done by adjusting a multivariate semi heavy-tailed distribution to portfolios containing indexes, currencies, and commodities and one cryptocurrency. Later, a rolling window is deployed to obtain the dynamic parameters of the distribution in a weekly basis. With a Markowitz specification problem, the optimal portfolio weights are computed dynamically using the parameters of the multivariate NIG distribution as inputs. The results provide evidence that correlations of Bitcoin with other assets may provide certain degree of diversification to portfolios; nevertheless, the high volatility of this asset makes it unpractical to employ in significant weights. This paper is relevant for researchers and practitioners as it provides a new tool to manage portfolios with cryptocurrencies and more reliable weights to the asset allocation.	multivariate nig;portfolio optimization;bitcoinstylized facts;cryptocurrencies;gold;dollar
1820	协同技术	Fair and Efficient Robust Secret Sharing Scheme against Rushing Adversaries	Robust secret sharing (RSS) is an extension of secret sharing, which can reconstruct a secret correctly even if any t shares are incorrect. The existing scheme would not effectively achieve fairness. Moreover, even for an optimal scheme, RSS still has the problem that one party is verified by multiple parties, leading to expensive communication costs. In this work, we construct a blockchain-aided RSS scheme that can ensure decentralization and fairness. The central building block for our scheme to handle a rushing adversary is a bulletin board we implement on the InterPlanetary File System. Furthermore, we design a monetary penalty mechanism to impose real penalties on corrupt parties. Each participant either uploads his share correctly or loses his deposit. In addition, our scheme eliminates considerable communication between participants. Compared with the previous schemes, our scheme has a lower communication complexity, which is close to O & SIM;n. We conduct experiments to show the performance of our scheme. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a fair RSS scheme. For shares with a length of 128 bits, the time for each participant to execute the verification phase is 470 ms.

We construct a dual currency model to study whether CBDC with a record-keeping technology can reduce tax evasion incentives in cash transactions and further achieve better allocations than a cash-only economy with respect to fiscal arithmetic. We show that when there is inefficiency associated with tax evasion in cash transactions, introducing CBDC with strictly positive interest can remove the inefficiency and thus improve welfare by discouraging tax evasion and rewarding tax payments. This beneficial effect of the CBDC depends on the central bank's fiscal role.	cash;central bank digital currency;inflation tax;monetary policy;tax evasionmonetary-policy;money;independence;private
1822	虚拟经济	Blockchain technology acceptance by investment professionals: a decomposed TPB model	Purpose The rapid emergence and acceptance of blockchain applications by investment professionals has made this study significant. The study aims to examine the degree of trust and acceptance of blockchain technology in the Indian financial services industry. Design/methodology/approach The decomposed theory of planned behaviour (DTPB) model is investigated using responses from 200 investment professionals to an online survey on blockchain technology adoption, and partial least squares structural equation modelling using SmartPLS 3.0 is used to analyse the results. Findings In general, the results support a DTPB and offer the best fit to the data. This study may have significant drawbacks in predicting blockchain technology's acceptance by investment professionals. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the research instruments used in this study, which engage users in business settings, are equally successful in the context of investment professionals. Research limitations/implications In predicting blockchain acceptance by investing experts, this study may have significant drawbacks. Practical implications As a result of TAM studies, it has been determined that perceived usefulness is more essential than perceived ease of use. Therefore, investment professionals may have discovered significant subjective normative impacts on behavioural intention. Management must devise techniques for implementing blockchain technology in digital financial services that are compatible with users' workplaces. Originality/value Users may benefit from this research by concentrating on blockchain acceptance to improve digital banking services.	blockchain technology;tpb;tam;decomposed tpb;pls-semuser acceptance;information technology;internet banking;perceived ease;adoption;determinants;intentions;attitudes;behavior
1823	实体经济	Potential functionality and workability of blockchain within a building information modelling (BIM) environment	Purpose Although building information modelling (BIM) brings various benefits and open up the construction industry to many new possibilities, it is not without some challenges. Blockchain has the potential to resolve some of these problems. It has shown that blockchain and BIM can potentially work together in bringing various benefits to all project stakeholders. However, there is a lack of research and knowledge in relation to blockchain-based BIM. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to close this gap by looking into the potential functionality and workability of blockchain within a BIM environment. Design/methodology/approach A four-stage preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses systematic literature review technique has been used to review the blockchain- and BIM-related information sources published. A total of 53 journal articles, 13 books and 27 other resources including that of reports and websites have been included in this paper. Findings Blockchain-based BIM has countless possibilities, ranging from simple tasks such as tracking of orders to automation of construction payment claims. The literatures have suggested that the several weaknesses that BIM possesses including trust issue, asset ownership issue and data reliability issue could be resolved by incorporating blockchain into its processes. Originality/value Because of the lack of researches on the workability of blockchain and BIM, this paper aims to close this gap by proposing a framework for the interaction between blockchain and BIM for a typical building project. This paper has reviewed a substantial amount of currently available knowledge on blockchain-based BIM and its relevancy to the construction industry. This paper believes that the information could be of use to potential BIM tools maker and the construction industry for the betterment of BIM implementation throughout a project life cycle.	bim;blockchain;building information modelling;construction technology;reviewconstruction;technology;challenges;benefits;adoption;barriers;sector
1824	核心技术	An efficient, provably-secure DAG based consensus mechanism for industrial internet of things	Modern industrial systems are mostly integrated with the IoT ecosystem for rapid communication with the Internet of Things (IoT). In industrial systems, the interaction among different devices requires a secure, efficient, and robust IoT infrastructure. Emerging blockchain technology provides highly secure network nodes to support industrial systems and IoT. This work discusses the current state of blockchain integration with industrial IoT systems. In order to improve the security of Industrial IoT, a DAG-based consensus model is developed to addresses the issues in the generic blockchain network. We compared the merits of the DAG-based blockchain model with the Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Moreover, a main integration of DAG-based blockchain technology with industrial IoT and key challenges are presented with evaluation results. The performance evaluations are carried out with the help of block weight, ledge scalability and IIoT reliability analysis.	industrial system;internet of things;blockchain technology;security;consensus mechanismarchitecture;blockchain;iot
1825	核心技术	Rampant Smoothing (RTS) Algorithm: an optimized consensus mechanism for private Blockchain enabled technologies	Blockchain is a distributed database method of storing electronic information in digital form that makes it challenging to transform, hack, or rogue the system. Each time a new operation transpires on the Blockchain, an irreversible information of that transaction is buffered in all connected ledgers. Each distributed ledger is programmable, immutable and timestamped. This paper follows an immutable policy to ensure chronological trust-administration, security and privacy to resolve anomalies within linearly stored blocks. To prove the validity of submitted data, a consensus mechanism is required, which was attained by implementing a novel 'Rampant Smoothing Algorithm' that was encoded using Solidity (i.e., aimed at developing smart contracts). Experimental policies were aligned with Good Clinical Data Management Practices that portrayed effective 'smart contract modeling' to demonstrate resistance against majority consensus attacks by harnessing the core feature of 'privacy decentralization'. During implementation of Blockchain network, an interconnected system of six hundred nodes (i.e., data points) were gradually configured.	blockchain;healthcare system;privacy;security;smart contracts;distributed ledger;electronic medical records (emr)management

1827	市场治理	A Fair Method for Distributing Collective Assets in the Stellar Blockchain Financial Network	One of the most popular platforms in token-based banking is the flexible Stellar platform. The wide range of Stellar's features allows companies to use it in modern cryptocurrency and token-based banking. This network charges a fee for each transaction. A percentage of the net amount is generated as the inflation rate of the network due to the increased number of tokens. These fees and inflationary amounts are aggregated into a general account and ultimately distributed among the network members on a collective-vote basis. In this mechanism, network users select an account as the destination to which they wish to transfer assets using their user interface, generally a wallet. This account could be the account of charities that need this help. The target distribution network is then determined based on the voting results of all members. One of the challenges in this network is the targeted and fair distribution of these funds between accounts. In this paper, the first step is a complete infrastructure of a Stellar financial network that will consist of three network-based segments of the core network, an off-chain server, and a wallet interface. In the second step, a context-aware recommendation system is implemented to solve the targeted management of payroll account selection. The results of this study concerning the importance of the targeted division of collective assets show a context-aware recommendation system as a solution to improve the process of Stellar users' participation in the voting process.	blockchain;cryptocurrency;token-based banking;stellar;fair distribution
1828	实体经济	Land Registry Framework Based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) for Environmental Sustainability	Providing a system user with a unique and secure identity is a prerequisite for authentication and authorization aspects of a security system. It is generally understood that the existing digital identity systems store the identity details in centralized databases, and users store the identity details in centralized databases in which users do not have any control over them. These vulnerabilities in the traditional digital identities make them susceptible to various malicious assaults and modifications. Users' personally identifiable information (PII) may leak through these identity solutions that can consequently affect other applications being used by the users, and they have no control over them. Land registration is a major domain of governance that defines civilians' well-being and needs to be handled properly to avoid conflict and to support Environmental Sustainability. These traditional land registry applications also lack identity parameters due to weaknesses in identity solutions. A secure and reliable digital identity solution is the need of the hour. Self-sovereign identity (SSI), a new concept, is becoming more popular as a secure and reliable identity solution for users based on identity principles. SSI provides users with a way to control their personal information and consent for it to be used in various ways. In addition, the user's identity details are stored in a decentralized manner, which helps to overcome the problems with digital identity solutions. This article reviews existing SSI solutions and analyzes them using SSI principles. It also assesses the SSI components required for constructing SSI frameworks that adhere to the SSI principles. Furthermore, it defines the procedures for establishing an SSI ecosystem, explores the laws governing digital identity that governments have adopted, and identifies SSI applications in several fields. Finally, a review of SSI applications in the domain of land registry systems is given in order to propose an SSI-based land registry framework for a secure and reliable land registry system.	land registry;ssi compliance;identity principle;ssi components;self-sovereign identity;environmental sustainabilityblockchain technology;real-estate;transactions;protocol;issues
1829	技术治理	Research on information dissemination of blockchain network community under the action of negative incentive mechanism	Traditional online communities suffer from false, repetitive or low-level content, with blockchain technology able to solve these problems. Specifically, the incentive mechanism is the blockchain's core value, including positive and negative incentive mechanisms. The former strengthens people's behaviour positively, while the latter, on the contrary, adopts mandatory methods such as punishment to eliminate the occurrence of certain types of behaviour. The negative incentive mechanism is the key factor to solve the problems presented above that traditional online communities face. Specifically, this article develops a solution that utilises the negative incentive mechanism, based on the classic infectious disease model (SIR model), introduces smart nodes, puts forward the SSIR model of information dissemination in the blockchain network community, and establishes a set of differential equations reflecting the information dissemination rules. Based on the parameter assumption and solving the equations with MATLAB, this article compares and reveals the changes of different user types on the SIR and SSIR models. Furthermore, we utilise the data collected from the Steemit blockchain community and Sina Weibo platform and apply the Social Network Analysis method to compare and analyse the information dissemination between the blockchain and the traditional network community. The research results highlight that the negative incentive mechanism in the blockchain network community affords a more rational behaviour of user information dissemination, a simpler interaction between users, and reducing to a certain extent the dissemination of 'distorted' or 'uncertain' information.	blockchain;negative incentive mechanism;sir;social network analysis;steemitmodel
1830	实体经济	Research on Maximizing Influence of Blockchain Social Network Based on BCLT Model	In the blockchain social network, the traditional influence maximization algorithm has the problem of insufficient accuracy of the influence spread. To solve the above problem, a BCLT model including the characteristics of the blockchain is established based on the linear threshold model. The BC-RIS algorithm is proposed based on the reverse reachable set. The BC-RIS algorithm's influence spread and running time and the traditional algorithm is compared using the real blockchain social network data set. The experimental results show that the BC-RIS algorithm can obtain a larger influence spread range, which is more in line with the influence propagation law of the blockchain social network.	
1831	实体经济	A blockchain-based keyword search scheme with dual authorization forelectronic health record sharing br	Electronic health record is an electronic file that records people's medical treatment and physical examinationinformation in an all-around way which is an important branch of building a smart medical system. The sharingof electronic health records not only helps people use medical resources anytime and anywhere to deal withtricky physical conditions but also provides valuable and true reference materials for medical practitionersin related research. However, the current electronic health record sharing schemes have the problems ofelectronic health record data leakage, access authorization mechanism incomplete, inflexible operation ofelectronic health record data, low search efficiency, and untrustworthy cloud server provider. To solve thesechallenging problems, we propose a new blockchain-based keyword search scheme with dual authorizationfor electronic health record sharing. The certificateless cryptosystem avoids certificate management and keyescrow. The construction of the authorization matrix realizes the dual authorization of the identities of usersand the corresponding searchable departments. Also, the matrix can manage the access rights of users. Thesignal value of the ciphertext index can realize the authority management of ciphertext index. The ciphertextMAC verification code stored in the blockchain can verify the legality of ciphertext, and the smart contract isused to ensure fair transactions. Therefore, our scheme is more suitable for sharing confidential and sensitiveelectronic health records. The security proof concludes that the proposed scheme is indistinguishability underthe keyword guessing attack. Besides, the result of performance analysis and comparison simulations showthat the proposed scheme has higher performance than some related schemes	authority management;blockchain;certificateless cryptosystem;dual authorization;electronic health recordpublic-key encryption;security
1832	实体经济	An interval type-2 fuzzy axiomatic design method: A case study for evaluating blockchain deployment projects in supply chain	This study is concerned with the development of the axiomatic design (AD) method under an interval type-2 fuzzy (IT2F) environment and its application in evaluating blockchain deployment projects in supply chains. Blockchain is a transformative technology that has received significant attention recently. Blockchain technology can process various business transactions by offering a reliable and decentralized infrastructure. Supply chain management is an important application area of blockchains due to its desirable properties, including data security, extended visibility, product traceability, digitalization, and disintermediation. Since blockchain technologies are in their infancy, adopting them to supply chains requires proper design methodologies. Fuzzy AD offers valuable computational mechanisms to evaluate design options in the presence of functional requirements. However, extending AD to different fuzzy extensions is not an easy task, and area-based calculations hinder its widespread applicability. In this study, an IT2F-AD method is developed based on the concept of fuzzy subsethood. The potential of the fuzzy subsethood measure as the main computation engine within type-1 and IT2F-AD is demonstrated. Finally, an integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is proposed by using IT2F Best-Worst Method (IT2F-BWM) and IT2F-AD. The proposed model is used to prioritize blockchain deployment projects in a real-life case study. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

1833	协同技术	Policychain: A Decentralized Authorization Service With Script-Driven Policy on Blockchain for Internet of Things	The decentralization mechanism provides manufacturers and distributors with greater customization and flexibility they need through Internet of Things (IoT)-based industrial collaboration systems (IoT-ICS), but it has brought forward security concerns about the shared data-processing tasks and IoT-based access to services and resources. To address them, we propose a practical blockchain solution to achieve decentralized policy management and evaluation on attribute-based access control (ABAC). By offloading the responsibility of ABAC policy administration and decision making to blockchain nodes, a blockchain-based access control framework, called Policychain, is presented to ensure policy with high availability, autonomy, and traceability. To deliver a solid design, we first present a transaction-oriented policy expression scheme with a well-defined syntax and semantics. The scheme can translate ABAC policies into the blockchain transactions with JavaScript object notation (JSON) syntax and script-based logical expression. We further realize a script-driven policy evaluation by extending blockchain inherent scripting instructions to support attribute acquisition of ABAC entities. Furthermore, we propose a policy lifecycle management scheme from policy creation, renovation, to revocation, in which policies are verified by three validation principles at the transaction level. Finally, we provide sophisticated analysis and experiments to show that our framework is secure and practical for decentralized policy management on ABAC in IoT-ICS.	blockchains;internet of things;task analysis;peer-to-peer computing;consensus protocol;collaboration;authorization;attribute-based access control (abac);blockchain;internet of things (iot);policy script;scripting language;transaction-based policyaccess-control;xacml
1834	协同技术	SmartABAC: Enabling Constrained IoT Devices to Make Complex Policy-Based Access Control Decisions	While attribute-based access control (ABAC) is a promising technique to govern interactions in the Internet of Things (IoT), most existing ABAC models are designed to run on remote servers or gateway devices. This scenario is misaligned with recent trends toward IoT decentralization, such as the Swarm, which expects devices to autonomously share resources, making their own access decisions for enhanced privacy and reliability. In this article, we propose SmartABAC: a fast, concise, and expressive ABAC model that can be executed in constrained IoT devices. It combines the performance of policies based on attribute enumeration, with techniques that enhance policy expressiveness, such as typed and hierarchical attributes. We specified SmartABAC using first-order logic, designed a use case, and evaluated it in both constrained and nonconstrained IoT environments. Results show that our model can represent a variety of access policies, including nested multiattribute rules, while using less than 100 bytes per policy, on average, for a smart home use case. Our C-based SmartABAC implementation is at least 255 times faster than existing models and can evaluate 3000 policies under 5 ms on a 32-MHz MCU.	access control;internet of things;data models;biological system modeling;numerical models;blockchains;servers;attribute-based access control (abac);authorization;internet of things (iot) securitycontrol framework;internet;swarm;architecture;things;model
1835	协同技术	Blockchain-based IoT enabled health monitoring system	Health monitoring systems are improving with the development of the internet of things. This paper proposes a secure architecture consisting of a four-layer internet of things enabled health monitoring system that collects patient data and classifies them into different medical categories. While collecting patient information from their wearable smart sensing devices for computation, the privacy and security of this process are essential. The main motive of this paper is to develop a lightweight and secure communication protocol using blockchain architecture for decentralized IoT networks and classify them into different categories using transfer learning. We propose a framework that uses blockchain for security and incorporates transfer learning to use multiple pre-trained models. The proposed routing technique uses factors like probability, credibility rating, and node energy to route the data to its destination such that the network overhead is reduced and the energy used is minimal. We classify the collected patient information using four different pre-trained convolutional neural network models: ResNet50, VGG19, InceptionV3, and SqueezeNet. We simulate the proposed routing approach and other benchmark schemes on various performance metrics. The results show that the proposed approach gives 92.24% classification accuracy.	blockchain;internet of things;opportunistic network;probabilistic routingintegrated blockchain;research issues;security
1836	协同技术	DAG blockchain-based lightweight authentication and authorization schemefor IoT devices br	As the extension and expansion of the Internet, the Internet of things (IoT) connects things with thenetwork through information sensing equipment to achieve intelligent identification, positioning, monitoring,management and other functions. With the increasing number of IoT users and devices, the demands forsecure communication and data confidentiality are getting higher and higher, and the identity authenticationand access control of IoT devices has become a huge challenge. In the IoT environment, the traditional deviceidentity and access management methods based on public key infrastructure (PKI) and blockchain bring theproblems of single point failure and scalability. The emergence of decentralized storage system and distributedledger technology directed acyclic graph (DAG) provide new ideas to solve these problems. In the paper, we usedistributed ledger technology IOTA with low energy demand to design a lightweight and scalable mechanism tomanage the identity of IoT devices and access control of large-scale IoT data, so as to ensure source reliabilityand sharing security of IoT data. In the new scheme, IOTA technology is used to realize the functions ofregistration, update, revocation and retrieval of the identity of IoT devices, which solves the defects caused bycentralized management. Inter planetary file system (IPFS) is used to store a large amount of data generated bydevices in the IoT, which not only reduces the burden on devices and systems of IoT, but also solves the singlepoint of failure, delay and other problems caused by traditional cloud storage. At the same time, the fog nodeis used to provide localized computing for a group of IoT devices to solve the problem of limited computingresources of IoT devices. In addition, in order to prevent data abuse caused by unauthorized devices accessingnetwork resources, a trusted access control mechanism is designed to achieve fine-grained access control, accesspolicy update and other functions, so as to better maintain the IoT environment and network security. Finally,the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation experiments, and the security andfunctions of the scheme are analyzed, which proves that the scheme meets the security demands of the IoTenvironment.	internet of things;iota;ipfs;fog computing;identity management;access control;securitysecurity;internet;privacy
1837	协同技术	Internet of Things Device Identification Algorithm considering User Privacy	The Internet of Things has become the third wave of the information industry and cloud computing, big data, and Internet technologies. Among the many identification technologies used in the Internet of Things, radiofrequency identification technology is undoubtedly one of the most popular methods today. It is replacing the traditional contact IC card and becoming a new trend of smart cards. At the same time, a large amount of data is generated in the IoT environment. A lot of data involve user privacy, and users do not have good control over these data. Collecting and utilizing these data on the basis of protecting user privacy have become an important problem to be solved urgently. With the implementation of the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education, major colleges and universities are developing rapidly through enrollment and expansion, which also brings inconvenience to campus security management. Although the traditional campus all-in-one card system can guarantee the security identity of people entering and leaving, it does not reasonably integrate and utilize this information, resulting in waste of information resources and, to a certain extent, the problem of user privacy leakage. To solve the above problems, a new system was developed to integrate resources to identify users. To protect the privacy data of Internet of Things users, a specific solution using blockchain technology is proposed; for the identity authentication problem of Internet of Things users, the identity authentication based on the public key address of the blockchain is used on the chain, and the group signature is used off the chain. The identity authentication method solves the contradiction between anonymity and traceability in blockchain application scenarios. The simulation results show that the system not only considers user privacy but also has extremely important practical significance for the promotion of Internet of Things and RF applications.	decision-making

1839	实体经济	Supply Chain Governance of Agricultural Products under Big Data Platform Based on Blockchain Technology	The present work serves to improve the stable cooperation relationship among subjects of supply chain such as enterprises, farmers, intermediary organizations, and retailers and enhance the governance and optimization of agricultural product supply chain, thus strengthening the competitiveness of China's agricultural industry. The supply chain governance of agricultural products is taken as the research object. Initially, the stabilities of two supply chain organization modes, "company and farmer" and "company, intermediary organization and farmer," are analyzed by static game analysis. Then, based on the above analysis and the characteristics of blockchain institutional technology, a detailed analyzation is made on the mechanism of supply chain of agricultural products governance based on blockchain technology. Finally, the functional framework of agricultural supply chain governance is designed based on the basic framework of blockchain technology, and analyzation is made on the trust mechanism and contract mechanism of agricultural supply chain governance based on blockchain technology. The research results show that problems such as information and cognitive constraints in agricultural supply chain governance cannot be completely solved only through the evolution of blockchain organizational structure and the supply of governance mechanism, and speculative behavior will still appear. Optimizing the governance of supply chain of agricultural products based on blockchain technology can realize the transformation of its governance scenario. Meanwhile, the blockchain technologies such as deintermediation, demistrust, and intelligent contract play an important role in the process of agricultural supply chain governance, which can make it change in many aspects such as organization mode, application operation, and governance mechanism. The rapid development of new generation information technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things, and computer technology makes it possible to comprehensively digitize economic activities such as production and transaction in the supply chain of agricultural products. The present work combines the technical logic of blockchain digital governance with the institutional logic of agricultural product supply chain governance and tries to solve the instability problems caused by imperfect organization, lack of trust, and incomplete contract in agricultural product supply chain governance with the characteristics of blockchain such as deintermediation, demistrust, and intelligent contract.

This paper investigates how to effectively supervise and manage the agricultural supply chain with regard to information traceability. Starting from establishing a system framework for tracing and querying information by applying BigchainDB, this paper combines Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) to identify and assess the key regulatory decisions for the government for both economic and ecological purposes. The final results obtained by DEMATEL and ANP are consistent. The vital role of the planting link in eco-economics sustainability is affirmed. Through analyzing the demands of supply chain practitioners, as well as both economic and ecologic views of key points, the qualification information is attached significance.

1841	协同技术	Attribute-based data access control scheme with secure revocation in fog computing for smart grid	Smart grid requires sharing sensitive data to external researchers. Attribute encryption is a common technique used in data sharing. Unfortunately, existing revocation mechanisms do not consider the following two issues. One is that the revoked user may save intermediate values computed in the past to illegally decrypt the updated cipher text. The other is that the update parameters of keys can be leaked to the revoked user, which leads to revocation failure. To address the above issues, we propose a verifiable outsourcing decryption and data sharing scheme, in which we introduce version parameters of ciphertexts and keys, and associate the update parameters of keys with each user to achieve security-enhanced revocation. In addition, a formal security proof is given under the DBDH assumption. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the scheme and the results show that the proposed scheme is more effective than current schemes.	attribute-based encryption;dynamic group data sharing;fog computing;secure revocation;smart gridcp-abe;encryption;efficient;blockchain;delegation
1842	实体经济	FogChain: A Blockchain-Based Peer-to-Peer Solar Power Trading System Powered by Fog AI	Microgrids, gaining traction from rising distributed generation for carbon reduction, demand novel solutions to regulate on- and off-grid operations, as well as both energy and monetary transfers between the microgrid and the central grid and among different microgrid participants. This research aims to develop and validate an intelligent microgrid management system to secure the competitiveness of Singapore's energy market, by leveraging the inherent synergy between two emerging technologies, i.e., blockchain for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) solar power trading and fog computing for grid infrastructure management. For this vision, we have developed FogChain, an integrative, cost-effective, and scalable microgrid operating system (MGOS), consisting of three technical service layers: 1) a novel microgrid information infrastructure based on the fog-computing paradigm (i.e., intelligence on edge); 2) a blockchain-based microgrid service layer, providing smart contract and decentralized control capabilities for grid application development; and 3) a microgrid application layer (i.e., P2P energy trading) over the blockchain-based grid service. This MGOS would fundamentally transform how solar power is traded among participating electricity prosumers, leading to potentially new operational and business models. We have implemented the FogChain system and conducted extensive experiments to verify its performance advantages. Our results demonstrate that FogChain can efficiently process energy auction among 1000 participants with 1.1 s delay on average, reduce transmission cost up to 20% under the loss-aware trading mechanism, and reduce the solar yield prediction error to 0.11. Our system prototype suggests that FogChain provides a promising solution for efficient decentralized energy trading and intelligent distributed control for microgrids.	microgrids;blockchains;system analysis and design;hardware;peer-to-peer computing;smart contracts;renewable energy sources;blockchain;distributed system;energy trading;fog computing;microgrid management;smart contractenergy management;microgrids
1843	核心技术	Managing data security in fog computing in IoT devices using noise framework encryption with power probabilistic clustering algorithm	With the development of cloud computing and its technologies, most institutions and users are interested in storing their sensitive information on third-party servers. Most of the data has been collected using the Internet of Things (IoT) devices which must be saved in the cloud for further analysis. Intermediate access or unauthorized users trying to access sensitive information during the data storage causes data confidentiality, integrity, and privacy-related issues. The IoT devices are integrated with fog computing to carry out the specific computation, latency, and storage over the internet backbone. However, the IoT with Fog computing process ensures the enormous way of managing data security, data latency, privacy, and security are significant issues. In this work, the cryptographic algorithm with the clustering algorithm is developed to manage data security in a distributed environment to overcome this issue. Initially, the cluster heads are identified according to the power probabilistic criteria, and the clustering process is performed for making the data transmission in the fog systems. During data transmission, data security is managed by applying the noise protocol framework encryption process. The encryption technique utilized the various cryptographic functions that effectively manage the privacy and security of the data. The introduced system has been compared with another probabilistic clustering scheme named energy-Efficient Heterogeneous Clustering Algorithm (EEHCA). The discussed process to minimize the intermediate attacks also overcome the node high energy consumption while transmitting the data.	data security;internet of things (iot);cloud computing;fog computing;probabilistic clustering;noise protocol framework;encryption techniquesblockchain
1844	核心技术	Blockchain-based mutual authentication protocol without CA	Nowadays, most of the federation chain identity authentication adopts the certificate authentication of CA (Certification Authority) under PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) system, but the authentication of CA is one-way authentication, and users cannot evaluate the trustworthiness of CA, and its centralized structure is prone to the single point of failure, which will bring great security risks. To address this problem, we propose an efficient and reliable two-way authentication scheme to achieve membership authentication of the federated chain through elliptic curves and bilinear pairs. Membership authentication is performed directly by the federated chain supervisor through smart contracts, and then key negotiation is conducted among members, and the shared key determined after key negotiation generates a hash digest through a hash function as the unique transaction address of the federated chain members. This scheme can effectively solve the problems of CA one-way authentication and the easy failure of centralized CA. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, the scheme is able to resist multiple attacks and performs better in terms of overhead compared with the same type of protocol. We also design a scheme using Lagrangian interpolation to cope with the necessary key recovery and key update.	federated chain;bilinear pairs;elliptic curves;smart contractkey;secure
1845	实体经济	CONSTRUCTION OF CARBON EMISSION TRADING SYSTEM BASED ON BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY	Establish a carbon emission trading mechanism to integrate low-carbon environmental protection and blockchain technology, so that the emission of pollutants can be rigidly constrained, optimise the allocation of environmental resources, and contribute to the protection of ecological environment and the construction of green homes. Most of the existing researches are about the theoretical analysis of the carbon emission trading market and block chain, and the research content of the overall construction and application of the trading system is less. Starting from the marketisation of carbon emissions trading, combining the technical advantages of block chain decentralisation, high security, and non-tamper ability, this paper proposes a many-to-many "pan-bilateral" trading mechanism, and establishes a complete trading system structure. The system uses the block chain as a distributed ledger to achieve the purpose of decentralisation, reducing trust costs and transaction risks; smart contract technology ensures that both parties to the transaction have both money and goods; the hash algorithm encrypts data to ensure information security. Finally, use the Eclipse platform to conduct multiple rounds of transaction simulation and performance testing. According to the test results, the practicability and reliability of the transaction mechanism and system architecture in the article was verified, and the feasibility of block chain technology in the carbon emission trading market was proved.	carbon emissions trading;block chain technology;hash encryption;trading system
1846	实体经济	LTSM: Lightweight and Trusted Sharing Mechanism of IoT Data in Smart City	With the development of smart cities, the chimney construction method can no longer meet service needs. It is extremely urgent to build a unified urban brain, and the core issue is data sharing and fusion. Aiming at the problems of data island, data leakage, and high trust cost in the IoT of the smart city, a lightweight and trusted sharing mechanism (LTSM) is proposed. First, the blockchain is combined with federated learning to realize the data sharing, which not only protects the private data, but also ensures the sharing process trust. Then, a node selection algorithm based on credit value and a node evaluation algorithm based on smart contract are designed to improve the quality of federated learning. Finally, we propose an improved raft consensus to meet the delay and security requirements of the consortium blockchain in the smart city scenario. In the simulation, we evaluate the federated learning algorithm, the node selection algorithm, and the improved raft consensus, respectively. The experimental results show that the LTSM mechanism has a good application value. The federated learning model has a better accuracy, but its training time is also longer. The node selection algorithm is helpful to improve the accuracy of the federated learning model. The improved raft consensus improves the throughput.	blockchains;collaborative work;internet of things;data models;smart cities;security;data privacy;blockchain;data sharing;federated learning;smart cityinternet;performance;things
1847	实体经济	Design Guidelines and a Prototype Implementation for Cyber-Resiliency in IT/OT Scenarios Based on Blockchain and Edge Computing	The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its spread in industrial environments has changed production lines by dramatically fostering the dynamicity of data sharing and the connectivity of machines. However, such increased flexibility (also pushed by the adoption of edge devices) must not negatively affect the security and safety of industrial environments. The proposed solution adopts the blockchain to securely store in distributed ledgers topology information and access rules, maximizing the cyber resiliency of industrial networks. Topology information and access rules are stored and queried in a completely distributed manner, ensuring data availability even in case a centralized controller is temporarily down or the network partitioned. Moreover, blockchain consensus algorithms foster a participative validation of topology information, to ensure the identity of interacting machines/nodes, to securely distribute topology information and commands in a privacy-preserving manner, and to trace any past modification in a nonrepudiable manner. Finally, the adoption of configurable edge gateways allows to take prompt countermeasures in case potential threats are identified, by activating access rules stored in ledgers in a secure and distributed manner. In addition to solution design guidelines and architectural considerations, the article also presents performance results achieved with our CyberChain working prototype, with the goal of not only demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed solution but also its suitability in industrial environments.	security;topology;blockchains;network topology;logic gates;standards;monitoring;blockchain;cyber resiliency;edge computing;hyperledger fabric;industrial internet of things (iot)software-defined networking;iot;architecture;internet;things

1851	实体经济	Design of a Vaccine Passport Validation System Using Blockchain-based Architecture: Development Study	Background: COVID-19 is an ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. As of June 2021, 5 emergency vaccines were available for COVID-19 prevention, and with the improvement of vaccination rates and the resumption of activities in each country, verification of vaccination has become an important issue. Currently, in most areas, vaccination and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results are certified and validated on paper. This leads to the problem of counterfeit documents. Therefore, a global vaccination record is needed. Objective: The main objective of this study is to design a vaccine passport (VP) validation system based on a general blockchain architecture for international use in a simulated environment. With decentralized characteristics, the system is expected to have the advantages of low cost, high interoperability, effectiveness, security, and verifiability through blockchain architecture. Methods: The blockchain decentralized mechanism was used to build an open and anticounterfeiting information platform for VPs. The contents of a vaccination card are recorded according to international Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standards, and blockchain smart contracts (SCs) are used for authorization and authentication to achieve hierarchical management of various international hospitals and people receiving injections. The blockchain stores an encrypted vaccination path managed by the user who manages the private key. The blockchain uses the proof-of-authority (PoA) public chain and can access all information through the specified chain. This will achieve the goal of keeping development costs low and streamlining vaccine transit management so that countries in different economies can use them. Results: The openness of the blockchain helps to create transparency and data accuracy. This blockchain architecture contains a total of 3 entities. All approvals are published on Open Ledger. Smart certificates enable authorization and authentication, and encryption and decryption mechanisms guarantee data protection. This proof of concept demonstrates the design of blockchain architecture, which can achieve accurate global VP verification at an affordable price. In this study, an actual VP case was established and demonstrated. An open blockchain, an individually approved certification mechanism, and an international standard vaccination record were introduced. Conclusions: Blockchain architecture can be used to build a viable international VP authentication process with the advantages of low cost, high interoperability, effectiveness, security, and verifiability.	covid-19;vaccine passport;global border control;health policy;international infectious disease strategy;vaccine;policy;strategy;blockchain;privacy;security;testing;verification;certification;fast healthcare interoperability resourcefhir;care

Since its emergence, the world has seen the expansion of this new technology, which was initially developed as a digital currency more than a decade ago.

1853	协同技术	Chaotic and Paillier secure image data sharing based on blockchain and cloud security	Internet of Things (IoT) is a materializing technology that has considerable technical, social, and economic importance. The present day predictions for the influence of IoT are highly monumental. This is because data of any form is found to be predominant to the IoT paradigm, therefore serving different applications like smart home, smart city, healthcare, smart grid, smart farms, manufacturing, and so on. Hence, several heterogeneous sensors are said in existence to estimate different types of parameters and found to be useful for different users. In this paper, a secured image sharing method called a Blockchain Chaotic and Paillier Map-based Authentication (BC-PMA) to provide image data integrity and security by deploying a cloud computing environment is proposed. The BC-PMA method is split into three sections. First, registration of corresponding classes of images in the cloud server via blockchain is presented by employing the Cat Map Registration model. The second step involves the authentication process carried out by employing Paillier Map-based Authentication where validation is ensured via smart contracts. Finally, upon successful authentication, unique and separate classes of images are provided with the respective, therefore ensuring secured classes of image sharing between users in the cloud environment. The results have been analyzed against traditional blockchain-based methods and validated with enhanced simulated results, that good authentication accuracy, minimizing the false positive rate, block generation time, and size considerably. Experimental Result shows that the Authentication Accuracy of the proposed BC-PMA method is improved by 23%, and minimizes the False Positive Rate and Computational Cost by 32% and 22% when compared to the Existing Method.	internet of things;blockchain;chaotic map;paillier map;cloud computing environment;cloud server
1854	实体经济	BiSHM: Evidence detection and preservation model for cloud forensics	The cloud market is growing every day. So are cloud crimes. To investigate crimes that happen in a cloud environment, an investigation is carried out adhering to the court of law. Forensics investigations require evidence from the cloud. Evidence acquisition in the cloud requires formidable efforts because of physical inaccessibility and the lack of cloud forensics tools. Time is very crucial in any forensic investigation. If the evidence is preserved before the cloud forensic investigation, it can give the investigators a head start. To identify and preserve such potential evidence in the cloud, we propose a system with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based agent, equipped for binary classification that monitors and profiles the virtual machine (VM) from hypervisor level activities. The proposed system classifies and preserves evidence data generated in the cloud. The evidence repository module of the system uses a novel blockchain model approach to maintain the data provenance. The proposed system works at the hypervisor level, which makes it robust for anti-forensics techniques in the cloud. The proposed system identifies potential evidence reducing the effective storage space requirement of the evidence repository. Data provenance incorporated in the proposed system reduces trust dependencies on the cloud service provider (CSP).	artificial intelligence;cloud computing;machine learning;evidence acquisition;digital forensics

Cryptocurrencies are too confusing for laymen and require more investigation. In this study, we analyze the impact that the effective reproductive rate, an epidemiological indicator of the spread of COVID-19, has on both the price and trading volume of eight of the largest digital currencies-Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, and Binance. We hypothesize that as the rate of spread decreases, the trading price of the digital currency increases. Using Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity models, we find that the impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the price and trading volume of cryptocurrencies varies by currency and region. These findings offer novel insight into the cryptocurrency market and the impact that the viral spread of COVID-19 has on the value of the major cryptocurrencies.	covid-19;cryptocurrency;bitcoin;garch;digital currency;fintechbitcoin;gold
1856	市场治理	Time-varying spillovers of higher moments between Bitcoin and crude oil markets and the impact of the US-China trade war: a regime-switching perspective	As the popularity of Bitcoin among finance communities continues, research on the relationship between Bitcoin and conventional commodities is becoming increasingly important. However, to date the literature has not yet found clear evidence of the dynamics of informational linkages between Bitcoin and the crude oil markets. This paper considers both static and time-varying information transmission of volatility, skewness and kurtosis, between two popular Bitcoin markets, Bitstamp and ItBit, and two major crude oil markets, WTI and Brent crude oil. A two-state regime-switching model is employed to estimate higher order moments and Legendre polynomials are applied to specify the time variations of spillovers. In addition, the latent impacts of the recent US-China trade war on spillovers are also explored. We conclude that crude oil is an information transmitter while Bitcoin is an information receiver in terms of the static and time-varying between-market transmission of three types of risk. The effect is affected by the occurrence of the trade war such that the information content of Bitcoin is enhanced once it begins. Moreover, Bitcoin is a diversifier for oil risk and this effect becomes more pronounced in the post-trade war period.	bitcoin;crude oil markets;spillovers of higher moments;regime-switching model;us-china trade warfutures markets;return dynamics;stock index;volatility;prices;model;commodity;cryptocurrencies;frequency;gold

The use of a permissioned blockchain network has multiple benefits as it reduces transaction costs and enables micro-transactions. Moreover, an improvement in security is obtained, eliminating the single point of failure in the control and management of the platform along with creating the possibility to trace back the actions of the participants and a mechanism of identification. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to create a decentralized and democratic energy market while complying with the current legislation and regulations on user privacy and data protection by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proof protocols and ring signatures.	blockchain;energy market;multi-agent system;negotiation;distributed ledger technologymanagement;technology;issues
1861	协同技术	DACFL: Dynamic Average Consensus-Based Federated Learning in Decentralized Sensors Network	Federated Learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving way to utilize the sensitive data generated by smart sensors of user devices, where a central parameter server (PS) coordinates multiple user devices to train a global model. However, relying on centralized topology poses challenges when applying FL in a sensors network, including imbalanced communication congestion and possible single point of failure, especially on the PS. To alleviate these problems, we devise a Dynamic Average Consensus-based Federated Learning (DACFL) for implementing FL in a decentralized sensors network. Different from existing studies that replace the model aggregation roughly with neighbors' average, we first transform the FL model aggregation, which is the most intractable in a decentralized topology, into the dynamic average consensus problem by treating a local training procedure as a discrete-time series.We then employ the first-order dynamic average consensus (FODAC) to estimate the average model, which not only solves the model aggregation for DACFL but also ensures model consistency as much as possible. To improve the performance with non-i.i.d data, each user also takes the neighbors' average model as its next-round initialization, which prevents the possible local over-fitting. Besides, we also provide a basic theoretical analysis of DACFL on the premise of i.i.d data. The result validates the feasibility of DACFL in both time-invariant and time-varying topologies and declares that DACFL outperforms existing studies, including CDSGD and D-PSGD, in most cases. Take the result on Fashion-MNIST as a numerical example, with i.i.d data, our DACFL achieves 19 similar to 34% and 3 similar to 10% increases in average accuracy; with non-i.i.d data, our DACFL achieves 30 similar to 50% and 0 similar to 10% increases in average accuracy, compared to CDSGD and D-PSGD.	decentralized sensors network;dynamic average consensus;federated learningcommunication;blockchain;algorithm
1862	实体经济	Roadside unit-based pseudonym authentication in vehicular ad hoc network	Information sharing among vehicles is an essential component of an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), but must take into consideration the security and privacy requirements of the network participants. Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is a pervasive network, where vehicles communicate wirelessly with nearby vehicles, infrastructure nodes, and other connected devices to improve road safety and provide other useful services. Security of VANET can be improved by ensuring that only authorized vehicles can participate in the network. This research proposes a new approach that uses roadside units (RSUs) to authenticate safety messages and notify vehicles about any unauthorized messages/senders. We present a three-tier architecture with a distributed blockchain to securely maintain the identity of all vehicles in the network. The use of this RSU-based approach helps to reduce the computational overhead on the On-board unit (OBU) of individual vehicles and does not require the transmission of lengthy certificates and certificate revocation lists with each message. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach achieves improved performance compared to existing techniques in terms of both authentication delay and channel load.	authentication;blockchain;pseudonym management;vanetprivacy-preserving authentication;distributed key management;blockchain;scheme;efficient;protection;framework
1863	核心技术	Digital signatures over HMAC entangled chains	In this work we present a new digital signature method based on hash chains and the hash message authentication code (HMAC). Unlike Blockchain technology, our approach establishes that the database of transactions is distributed among users, so each one maintains a personal record called Singlechain. The Lizama HMAC protocol defines a double authentication mechanism that verifies the origin and destination of the signature. Our analysis shows that the system generates a block size of around 6 kilobytes to perform double authentication using SHA-256, making it a promising alternative for digital signature using public key infrastructure. Since the method is based on the mathematical properties of hash functions and hash chains, the security of the method can be properly evaluated and thereby achieve a robust method of digital signatures in the quantum era.(c) 2021 Karabuk University.

1864	核心技术	Blockchain-based access control with k $k$-times tamper resistance in cloud environment	While cloud computing services such as cloud storage are fairly mature, it remains challenging to design efficient and secure cryptographic schemes to facilitate fine-grained access control and achieve other features. For example, existing ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption schemes do not generally have in-place limits on the number of access or access duration, which can consequently be exploited to perform economic denial of sustainability and other attacks. In addition, improving system efficiency can be challenging in large-scale operations. Thus, in this paper, we present a blockchain-based access control with k $k$-times tamper resistance. Our proposed approach allows one to set and enforce quota/limits on the number of accesses allowed for each user, whose integrity is ensured using blockchain. In addition, our proposed approach also allows multiple attribute authorities to coexist and work together with a central authority to facilitate secret key distribution and improve system efficiency. We then evaluate the security and the efficiency of our proposed approach to demonstrate its utility.	access control;blockchain;cloud storage;cp-abe;tamper resistancecontrol scheme;privacy
1865	核心技术	Toward Data Authenticity and Integrity for Blockchain-Based Mobile Edge Computing	Blockchain-based mobile edge computing (BMEC) solves the problem of limited computing resources of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, there are some security threats in the blockchain environment, among which the attacks against consensus algorithms are particularly serious, such as double-spending attacks and long-range attacks. These attacks target the block proposal or validation process, which compromise the integrity of the BMEC by overwriting the correct block record with the wrong block record. In this article,we propose a scheme to solve the above problem by using the cooperative threshold signature and group management scheme to protect the block validity. The blockchain process of a single node is controlled in a group cooperative way, and each new block is regarded as a valid block only if it has a valid threshold signature for the group to which it belongs. Concretely, the system is initialized by a cooperative distributed key generation protocol, the device management protocol uses a resident node to ensure the security and efficiency of device join and leave, and the signature issuing protocol can tolerate a certain degree of exceptions of nodes within the group. We analyze the resistance ability of the scheme against consensus attacks, prove the security of the scheme, and analyze the computing and communication efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the protocols of the proposed scheme have been conducted on cloud virtual machines and embedded boards, including Raspberry Pi and UP2 Grove, which indicated that the scheme is efficient in practical scenarios.	blockchains;security;protocols;servers;sensors;multi-access edge computing;scalability;blockchain;internet of things;threshold signature;mobile edge computing (mec)scheme
1866	实体经济	Evaluate the barriers of blockchain technology adoption in sustainable supply chain management in the manufacturing sector using a novel Pythagorean fuzzy-CRITIC-CoCoSo approach	The application of blockchain technology (BT) to sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has enriched the operations management processes with higher degrees of safety, traceability, transparency, and efficiency. This technology effectively helps prevent fake products and fraud across the supply chains, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency. However, the implementation of BT in supply chain management (SCM) is still in the initial stages since companies generally pay too much attention to the adoption phase while neglecting the managerial/organizational strategies required to succeed in this path; they also overlook the establishment of an effective link to the three main pillars of sustainability (i.e., the environmental, social, and economic aspects). Despite high potentials formerly confirmed for BT, a number of barriers have blocked the rapid adoption of this technology. Accordingly, the current study attempts to propose an innovative model hybridizing the combined compromise solution (CoCoSo) and criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) methods to identify and evaluate the barriers to the BT adoption in SSCM in the manufacturing sector. In the proposed model, CRITIC is responsible for calculating the criteria weights, and CoCoSo for evaluating the preference order of the organization. To exhibit the practicality of the introduced model, a case study is taken to evaluate the barriers to the adoption of BT in SSCM within PFSs environment. Moreover, we exhibit a sensitivity analysis over parameter values in view of examining the stability of our proposed approach. Finally, we draw attention to a comparison between our developed PF-CRITIC-CoCoSo decision-making framework with an existing PF-WASPAS method to show its superiority and potency.	blockchain technology;manufacturing sector;pythagorean fuzzy sets;combined compromise solution;multi-criteria decision-making;sustainable supply chainindustry 4.0;ledger technology;model;internet;operations;efficient;network;design

Prevailing solutions employ authoritative centers to efficiently manage and share massive data. They are not suitable for secure and trustworthy decentralized data provenance sharing due to the inevitable dishonesty or failure of trusted centers. With the advent of the blockchain technology, embedding data provenance in immutable blocks is believed to be a promising solution. However, a provenance file, usually a directed acyclic graph, cannot be embedded in blocks as a whole because its size may exceed the limit of a block, and may include various sensitive information that can be legally accessed by different users. To this end, this paper proposed the BSTProv, a blockchain-based system for secure and trustworthy decentralized data provenance sharing. It enables secure and trustworthy provenance sharing by partitioning a large provenance graph into multiple small subgraphs and embedding the encrypted subgraphs instead of raw subgraphs or their hash values into immutable blocks of a consortium blockchain; it enables decentralized and flexible authorization by allowing each peer to define appropriate permissions for selectively sharing some sets of subgraphs to specific requesters; and it enables efficient cross-domain provenance composition and tracing by maintaining a high-level dependency structure among provenance graphs from different domains in smart contracts, and by locally storing, decrypting, and composing subgraphs obtained from the blockchain. Finally, a prototype is implemented on top of an Ethereum-based consortium blockchain and experiment results show the advantages of our approach.	blockchain;data provenance;secure and trustworthy data sharing;smart contractinternet;things
1868	协同技术	Joint Optimization for Mobile Edge Computing-Enabled Blockchain Systems: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach	A mobile edge computing (MEC)-enabled blockchain system is proposed in this study for secure data storage and sharing in internet of things (IoT) networks, with the MEC acting as an overlay system to provide dynamic computation offloading services. Considering latency-critical, resource-limited, and dynamic IoT scenarios, an adaptive system resource allocation and computation offloading scheme is designed to optimize the scalability performance for MEC-enabled blockchain systems, wherein the scalability is quantified as MEC computational efficiency and blockchain system throughput. Specifically, we jointly optimize the computation offloading policy and block generation strategy to maximize the scalability of MEC-enabled blockchain systems and meanwhile guarantee data security and system efficiency. In contrast to existing works that ignore frequent user movement and dynamic task requirements in IoT networks, the joint performance optimization scheme is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, we design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based algorithm to solve the MDP problem and define the multiple and variable number of consecutive time slots as a decision epoch to conduct model training. Specifically, DDPG can solve an MDP problem with a continuous action space and it only requires a straightforward actor-critic architecture, making it suitable for tackling the dynamics and complexity of the MEC-enabled blockchain system. As demonstrated by simulations, the proposed scheme can achieve performance improvements over the deep Q network (DQN)-based scheme and some other greedy schemes in terms of long-term transactional throughput.	blockchain;mobile edge computing;computation offloading;deep deterministic policy gradient (ddpg)resource-allocation;industrial internet;consensus;performance;security;scheme;things;cloud
1869	技术治理	A Blockchain Ontology for DApps Development	Decentralized Applications, or DApps, provide distributed trusted applications that use blockchains. They are often composed of several services, such as transaction scalability protocols, decentralized storage and distributed computing solutions. In order to help formalize these applications, facilitate their development and improve their interoperability, we propose a novel blockchain Ontology focused on the concepts involving DApps. This ontology extends the existing EthOn ontology. It defines several key concepts related to DApps development, as well as the relations between these concepts. It features the formalization of known use cases and design patterns of blockchain technology through blockchain patterns. We use Semantic Web Rule language (SWRL) in order to define rules that express constraints on the formalized concepts. We then execute an inference engine and obtain new constraints on the properties of a defined DApp, such as its cost, based on the DApp characteristics and the services it uses. For illustration we show the inference of constraints between the Ethereum blockchain and its sidechain Polygon. We apply our research work in the field of blockchain video games. This application shows how to use the ontology to model DApps, and can be adapted to other fields.	blockchains;ontologies;decentralized applications;interoperability;scalability;games;owl;blockchain;interoperability;decentralized applications;dapps;ontology
1870	虚拟经济	Deep learning in predicting cryptocurrency volatility	This paper focuses on the prediction of cryptocurrency volatility. The stock market volatility represents a very influential aspect that affects a wide range of decisions in business and finance. Recently, the volatility spillovers between the cryptocurrency market and other financial markets are detecting. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency volatility forecasts underperform the market dynamics. This paper develops a suitable model to capture the cryptocurrency volatility dynamics. We base on deep learning techniques, which produce more reliable results than standard methods in finance by capturing complex data interactions. Specifically, we refer to a Jordan Neural Network, which is a parsimonious recurrent neural network showing more predictability power compared to other models designed for time series, the Self Exciting Threshold Autoregressive model models and the Non-Linear Autoregressive Neural Networks.

1871	协同技术	Blockchain technology as a Fog computing security and privacy solution: An overview	The emergent of Fog computing as an extension of Cloud computing, from the center of the internet architecture to the IoT end user's devices, aims to enhance the processing power of the resource-constraint IoT devices and deliver them other services since it locates close to these devices. This extension was also suggested to boost the standard of IoT system implementations thus decreasing energy consumption and latency for those applications that need fast responses. However, as stated in recent literature, Fog computing may have some important security and privacy challenges. On the other hand, Blockchain, which was generated and used in crypto-currencies, has been applied in a wider range of applications due to the security, privacy, distributed trust management, and reliability features provided. Among the applications, which have recently been attractive about blockchain is Fog computing. Blockchain in Fog computing may achieve a distributed and trusted, identity management, secure data, reputation, and payment systems. This survey discusses the state-of-the-art impact of the blockchain on the security and privacy of Fog computing. The findings elucidate the vision of blockchain in Fog computing-security and privacy-based enhancement and draw attention to open challenges and future research directions.	fc;bc;challenge;security;privacyresearch issues;access-control;mobile edge;big data;iot;internet;management;cloud;challenges;authentication
1872	市场治理	Covid-19 impact on cryptocurrencies: Evidence from a wavelet-based Hurst exponent	Cryptocurrency history begins in 2008 as a means of payment proposal. However, cryptocurrencies evolved into a complex ecosystem of high yield speculative assets. Contrary to traditional financial instruments, they are not (mostly) traded in organized, law-abiding venues, but on online platforms, where anonymity reigns. This paper examines the long term memory in return and volatility, using high frequency time series of seven important coins. Our study covers the pre-Covid-19 and the subsequent pandemic period. We use a recently developed method, based on the wavelet transform, which provides more robust estimators of the Hurst exponent. We detect that, during the peak of Covid-19 pandemic (around March 2020), the long memory of returns was only mildly affected. However, volatility suffered a temporary impact in its long range correlation structure. Our results could be of interest for both academics and practitioners.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

1874	平台项目	Empirical evaluation of nodes and channels of the lightning network	Off-chain networks provide an attractive solution to the scalability challenges faced by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. While first interesting networks are emerging, we currently have relatively limited insights into the structure and distribution of these networks. Such knowledge, however, is useful, when reasoning about possible performance improvements or the security of the network. For example, information about the different node types and implementations in the network can help when planning the distribution of critical software updates.& nbsp;This paper reports on a large measurement study of Lightning, a leading off-chain network, considering recorded network messages over a period of more than two years. In particular, we present an approach to classify the node types (LND, C-Lightning and Eclair) in the network, and find that we can determine the implementation of 99.9% of nodes correctly in our data set. We then report on geographical aspects of the Lightning Network, showing that proximity is less relevant, and that the Lightning Network is particularly predominant in metropolitan areas. Furthermore, we address various aspects of channels in the Lightning Network combined with the data we classified. We also demonstrate that channel endpoints behave very fairly and rarely cheat, that the same channel endpoints tend not to reconnect after the channel connection has closed and that there are more inactive than active channels in the Lightning Network.& nbsp;As a contribution to the research community, we will release our experimental data together with this paper.

1875	实体经济	Consortium Capabilities for Enterprise Blockchain Success	Enterprise blockchain projects have great promise. They can cut costs and promote efficiency through disintermediation, increase transparency for tracking intercompany transactions, expand knowledge through consortia databases, and improve workflows through shared business processes. Despite its potential, blockchain technology has failed to produce promised benefits for enterprise networks. While the underlying technology has advanced rapidly, managerial capabilities needed to form and manage blockchain consortia have lagged, and as a result, few consortia have succeeded. This chapter reviews the extant literature on blockchain consortia and provides a framework that identifies (1) foundational conditions that precede effective consortium formation, (2) capabilities required for effective consortium functioning and evolution, and (3) partner and ecosystem-level outcomes associated with successful blockchain projects.	enterprise blockchain;blockchain consortium;blockchain consortia;strategic capabilities;success factors
1876	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Reference Architecture for Automated, Transparent, and Notarized Attestation of Compliance Adaptations	Featured Application This paper presents an approach to using blockchain technology to configure automated, transparent, and cryptographically signed cloud applications. With cloud computing, organizations must comply with applicable laws, policies, and best practices. Companies typically rely on cloud service providers to implement and adopt regulations. This consulting phase is often time-consuming, costly, and not transparent. Organizations must trust the third party's implementation and associated documentation processes. To resolve this dilemma, we present a blockchain-based reference architecture for the automated, transparent, and notarized attestation of such compliance adaptations. Before proposing a solution, our approach is to understand the underlying research context. We conduct a machine-learning-supported systematic literature review to create a knowledge base. A reference architecture, including a prototype for configuring intrusion-detection systems, is developed using design science research. A mixed-methods-based approach is used for the evaluation of the proposed architecture. A quantitative survey is then used to show that the user experience of the developed prototype can be rated as positive, with an average value of 0.7. Finally, two focus group discussions are used to analyze the presented prototype qualitatively. As a result, we demonstrate how to actively support secure and trustworthy communication between a cloud service provider and an organization applying blockchain configurations.	cloud computing;software;configuration;compliance;blockchain;smart contracts;business processgoogle-scholar;cloud;challenges;security;science;scheme;scopus;web
1877	实体经济	Improving Agricultural Product Traceability Using Blockchain	Most traditional agricultural traceability systems are centralized, which could result in the low reliability of traceability results, enterprise privacy data leakage vulnerabilities, and the generation of information islands. To solve the above problems, we propose a trusted agricultural product traceability system based on the Ethereum blockchain in this paper. We designed a dual storage model of "Blockchain+IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)" to reduce the storage pressure of the blockchain and realize efficient information queries. Additionally, we propose a data privacy protection solution based on some cryptographic primitives and the Merkle Tree that can avoid enterprise privacy and sensitive data leakage. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed system using the Ethereum blockchain platform and provided the cost, performance, and security analysis, as well as compared it with the existing solutions. The results showed that the proposed system is both efficient and feasible and can meet the practical application requirements.	blockchain;traceability;agricultural products;ethereum;ipfs;smart contractfood-supply chains;smart contract;iot systems;qr code;challenges;management;implementation;technology;issues
1878	实体经济	Towards collective energy Community: Potential roles of microgrid and blockchain to go beyond P2P energy trading	Decarbonisation of energy sector is crucial to deliver the future net zero energy system with promoting and facilitating the large-scale electrification of end-user sectors. It is necessary to provide sustainable, cost-effective, resilient and scalable energy solutions to exploit the power of citizens to contribute to the clean energy transition, increasing the flexibility of the overall energy system. Energy community, as the new actor, create an integrated pan energy market by bringing together the local consumers and energy market players. However, diversity of energy community brings huge challenges in integration of decentralized renewables with regulated framework, interaction of decentralized marketplaces, as well as interoperability of the cross-border energy sectors with privacy, security and incentives. This paper intends to provide an in-depth investigation on the role of microgrid and blockchain, alone and together, in facilitating the energy community as the "enabling framework" to boost the potential solutions of electrification in the transportation, building, and industrial sectors, as well as rural/ remote areas and islands towards a networking green ecosystem. This paper serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the modern microgrid on its control and communication technology with integration of blockchain services in promoting the techno-socio-economic innovations for the restructuring of the sustainable energy supply chain.	microgrid;blockchain;energy community;grid edge;p2p energy trading;collective self-consumptiondistributed generation;hierarchical control;design;technology;management;internet
1879	实体经济	Security enhancement of time synchronization and fault identification in WAMS using a two-layer blockchain framework	In this paper, we propose an auxiliary two-layer blockchain framework to improve the security and reliability of Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) in smart grids against adverse manipulation of time synchronization and interference with fault identification. The framework benefits from the blockchain's inherent advantages, such as distributed storage, consensus mechanism, and avoidance of single-point of failure while addressing typical challenges of employing blockchain technology in smart grids, such as the limitation of computation power and the high bandwidth requirements for data exchange. In the first layer of the proposed architecture, the security state of the system is determined based on the state opinion of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs), using a consensus mechanism. Then, in the second layer, Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs) use the first layer opinion to preserve the proper WAMS operation when some of the PMUs are compromised. In this setting and by utilizing a co-simulation testbed, we show the effectiveness of using smart contracts whereby PMUs and PDCs can reliably communicate and aggregate smart grid measurements while time synchronization and fault identification functionalities are appropriately maintained. We also evaluate several deployment scenarios and provide corresponding recommendations for the security enhancement of WAMS. Finally, we detail a fortification strategy that the Power System Operator (PSO) can use to harden the blockchain network, based on an adversarial model.	wide area measurement system (wams);blockchain;smart grid;phasor measurement units (pmu);phasor data concentrator (pdc)phasor measurement units;power-system
1880	实体经济	Can Blockchain technology help small islands achieve sustainable tourism? A perspective on North Cyprus	Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the presence and use of Blockchain technologies (BCTs) in the North Cyprus hotel and tourism sectors by eliciting stakeholder perspectives on BCT's role in sustainable tourism development and the current state of its application in North Cyprus. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology was used and primary data gathered via telephone interviews with sixteen managers of casino hotels. The researchers also used an observation technique for data collection in order to better analyse the existing case situation. Findings Although the findings show similarities in the stakeholders' awareness of cryptocurrencies, they lack overall knowledge of BCTs. The responses of participants indicate a lack of knowledge regarding the use of BCTs, particularly the areas in which they can be used. North Cyprus' tourism and hotel sectors are significantly behind the curve in terms of adopting innovative technologies, due to traditional operational concerns and to the limited scope of policy development. Research limitations/implications Policymakers should consider the practical implications for both the sector's and the country's resources in order to maximize environmental and financial gains. Practical implications The promotion of sustainable tourism can be facilitated by the wider adoption of BCTs as it could enable operators to manage their network relationships and business operations in a more socially and environmentally responsible manner. Originality/value No prior studies were found that evaluate the presence of BCTs in support of tourism development in North Cyprus. This study will assist practitioners in comprehending the practical implications and will enable policymakers to develop sector-specific policies.	bitcoin;blockchain;cryptocurrencies;small islands;sustainability;tourismbitcoin
1881	核心技术	Efficient Cross-Chain Transaction Processing on Blockchains	Blockchain has received great attention in academia and industry due to its decentralization and immutability. From the perspective of transaction processing, blockchain is a distributed shared ledger and database with the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and transparency. These features ensure the security of blockchain's reliability. However, because a blockchain network requires complex consensus verification between users, it causes problems such as a high cost of data exchange and a low system throughput. Such problems are aggravated when executing a cross-chain transaction, as it is particularly important to ensure the atomicity and isolation of transactions across the blockchain. Considering this, in this paper, we propose the cross-chain transaction processing flow of EOVPC and efficient transaction processing based on version control. Different from the existing cross-chain transaction approaches based on locking, we propose optimistic approaches in which the updated data can be used immediately, with a rolling back procedure that guarantees atomicity. We conducted extensive experiments, which show that our approaches can improve the throughput and success rate significantly.	blockchain;cross-chain interoperation;optimistic cross-chain consensus
1882	核心技术	Cross-Blockchain Technology: Integration Framework and Security Assumptions	Interoperability is identified as one of the major design constraints for blockchain technology. Cross-blockchain technology is fast evolving as the demand for value transfer among different blockchain systems is growing. A generic cross-blockchain design methodology for interoperability requires a set of suitable components to facilitate the integration process. One of the main challenges in the integration is to protect the integrity of the shared data. Various integration systems and their components may operate with different underlying security assumptions and this may lead to compromise of the overall security. In this paper we review the latest advancement in blockchain integration systems and provide a comprehensive analysis of integration characteristics for cross-blockchain technology and then define the essential components and modes of integration. Based on the outcome of our review, we propose a novel integration design decision framework that identifies key assumptions and critical characteristics of the cross-blockchain technology. The proposed framework facilitates the best-practice decision-making process. This reduces the potential for design errors and the associated security risks and performance degradation of the overall system.	blockchains;interoperability;protocols;standards;ecosystems;semantics;licenses;blockchain interoperability;cross-blockchain technology;blockchain integration system;cross-blockchain protocol;cross-blockchain integration frameworkinteroperability
1883	实体经济	Blockchain-hosted Data Access Agreements for Remote Condition Monitoring in Rail	Advances in sensor technologies, remote authentication, and high-bandwidth data networks mean that Remote Condition Monitoring (RCM) systems are now an essential "Internet of Things" (IoT) resource for the efficient operation of railway infrastructure. However, the full potential of the big data generated by these systems has yet to be realised. RCM data within the industry is typically collected and used in silos, with limited possibility of exploitation across system boundaries. In 2013, the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), on behalf of the GB rail industry, established a cross-industry research programme, T1010, which aimed to build stronger cooperation between stakeholders and to enable sharing of RCM data. Building on the outputs of T1010, this work explores the use of blockchains and smart contracts (SC) in the automation, in an auditable and tamper-proof way, of commercial agreements for RCM data transfers in rail. By removing the limitations of paper-based agreements, we aim to enable innovation in shared business processes and stimulate the market for RCM data in rail. Leveraging existing smart contract-based schemes for trading and sharing IoT data over blockchain networks, we identify suitable methods for the enforcement of agreements and ensure fair cost attribution between stakeholders, without a trusted third party. The outline of a blockchain-based RCM data audit framework is presented, appropriate data access agreements and accounting models are specified in detail, and three permissioned blockchain platforms (Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, and Iroha) have been analysed for their suitability for implementation. Finally, the chapter outlines planned future work around validation of the tools based on two industrial use cases: monitoring systems for unattended overhead line equipment and axle bearings.	big data;blockchain;remote condition monitoring;cost attribution;process automationsmart contracts
1884	实体经济	Electricity trade strategy of regional electric vehicle coalitions based on blockchain	As the currently popular energy-saving vehicles, EVs are widely used in urban commuter. However, its driving range is not long and the problems of charging difficulties in public areas have not been well solved. Aiming at the range anxiety encountered while EVs during driving, this paper proposes a blockchain-based V2V(vehicle-tovehicle) electricity trading strategy. First, we establish the cost model and revenue model of EVs, and put forward the EVs' coalition joining strategy and matching mechanism. Then, the consortium blockchain technology is used to build the V2V trading platform. Moreover, through PoS(proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism, the incentive allocation method considering the reputation value is designed. Finally, taking an area as example, the coalition transaction matching of regional EVs under different transaction conditions is calculated. The results show that, for trading platform, the profit from its operation is greater than its operating cost; For EVs participating in V2V, after the number of matching vehicles becoming saturated, the charging cost of charging EVs has reduced by more than 36% and the revenue of discharging EVs has increased by more than 33% compared to trade with the grid. The simulation results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.	blockchain;electric vehicles (evs);vehicle-to-vehicle;electricity trade;pos consensus mechanismscheme

However, equipment-related information's authenticity and integrity cannot be guaranteed in centralized systems currently, which limits the effectiveness of CESIM. In addressing this issue, a framework that combines blockchain and deep learning technologies is proposed by providing decentralized data storage, keeping data authentic, and protecting data from tampering. In accordance with the proposed framework, a prototype system is developed and further evaluated. Results show that the prototype system can improve the efficiency of equipment supervision, decision making, and accident tracking in equipment security management. In conclusion, this study aims to place emphasis on: (1) applying blockchain technology to ensure equipment related information authentic and secure; (2) developing word2vec + CNN-based deep learning to automatically identify keywords and categories of equipment inspection reports; and (3) verifying the feasibility of the proposed framework and developing a prototype system for further application	blockchain;deep learning;construction safety management;equipment security information;information authenticitysafety;system;industry;internet;model
1886	实体经济	Blockchain: An emerging novel technology to upgrade the current fresh fruit supply chain	Background: With the globalization of trade, the current fresh fruit supply chain now incorporates multiple entities, wide distribution, and intricate transactions. This brings about the issues of information tamper resistance, supply-demand relationship, and traceable supervision. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology with advantages of tamper resistance of information. It is expected to solve the problem of transaction resource allocation among several untrusted participants in the fresh fruit supply chain. Scope and approach: This article recommends the use of blockchain to upgrade the current fresh fruit supply chain, and highlights the advantages of blockchain in supply chain management. The obstacles faced by the implementation of this technology in relation to participants' attitude, fruit preservation, and blockchain technical loopholes have been analyzed as well. Key findings and conclusions: Blockchain can upgrade fresh fruit supply chain. It collects and uploads reliable data from fruit picking to final consumption through IoT-related technologies. After hash encryption and consensus verification, it is transmitted to P2P network for sharing. It balances the tension between supply and demand, brings funds for enterprises, simplifies supervision and traceability. Smart contracts reduce the cost of communication and trust. However, blockchain has some limitations such as difficulties in incorporating architecture, reliance on the IoT, immature fruit preservation technology, unclear legal supervision, lack of reference cases, and technical loopholes.	blockchain;smart contract;fresh fruit;supply chain managementsmart contracts;nitric-oxide;food waste;traceability;energy;quantification;challenges;emissions;framework;internet

Previous studies have extensively investigated the digital platforms from two views: economic view (i.c. as a sided marketplace) and engineering view (i.e. as an inovation infrastructure) Blockchain - a digital artefact that connects the distributed ledgers - resembles great overlaps and specifics to digital platforms. Building on this aspect, 1 first demarcate the Blockchain Product as a Platform (BPaaP) informed by the economic view and the Blockchain network as a platform (BNaaP) inspired by the engineering view. Given the seam of research around BNaaP, this research aims to depict the BNaaP's architectural design by drawing on the layered design of digital technologies. Using Ping An Group as a case, this research applies the thematic analysis method in analysing online open data. \s the main contribution, this research proposes the Adapted Layered Architecture of BNaaP that consists of (1) three design layers (foundation layer, interaction layer, and application layer); (2) adapted business scenarios; and (3) environmental factors. The suggested architectural design implies the BNaaP's internal synergistic collaboration among layers and the external adaptability to different business contexts. Overall, this research provides a novel angie to understand the Blockchain phenomenon and brings insightful implications to Blockchain practitioners.	digital platforms;blockchain platforms;blockchain network;case study;thematic analysis
1888	虚拟经济	Principles of Natural Resource Economics for Bitcoin	To assess claims such as Bitcoin is 'digital gold' it makes sense to examine whether Bitcoin exhibits features common to other exhaustible natural resources that are the concern of natural resource economists. We therefore present some foundational ideas in the economics of exhaustible resources and examine their relevance to Bitcoin. There are several useful similarities but also some key differences, chiefly with respect to how miners manage inventories, or their inventory policy. Therefore, to highlight this aspect, we use a simple model for any physical natural resource and introduce sensitivity to a capital-to-energy ratio. The resulting policy for Bitcoin miner over a halving cycle is not unlike a traditional miner in that optimal inventories are determined by optimal capital investments over the entire duration of the cycle.	bitcoin;miner;exhaustible resources;inventory policy
1889	实体经济	A Novel Blockchain-Based Healthcare System Design and Performance Benchmarking on a Multi-Hosted Testbed	As a result of the proliferation of digital and network technologies in all facets of modern society, including the healthcare systems, the widespread adoption of Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) has become the norm. At the same time, Blockchain has been widely accepted as a potent solution for addressing security issues in any untrusted, distributed, decentralized application and has thus seen a slew of works on Blockchain-enabled EHRs. However, most such prototypes ignore the performance aspects of proposed designs. In this paper, a prototype for a Blockchain-based EHR has been presented that employs smart contracts with Hyperledger Fabric 2.0, which also provides a unified performance analysis with Hyperledger Caliper 0.4.2. The additional contribution of this paper lies in the use of a multi-hosted testbed for the performance analysis in addition to far more realistic Gossip-based traffic scenario analysis with Tcpdump tools. Moreover, the prototype is tested for performance with superior transaction ordering schemes such as Kafka and RAFT, unlike other literature that mostly uses SOLO for the purpose, which accounts for superior fault tolerance. All of these additional unique features make the performance evaluation presented herein much more realistic and hence adds hugely to the credibility of the results obtained. The proposed framework within the multi-host instances continues to behave more successfully with high throughput, low latency, and low utilization of resources for opening, querying, and transferring transactions into a healthcare Blockchain network. The results obtained in various rounds of evaluation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework.	blockchain;hyperledger fabric;gossip protocol;raft orderer;electronic healthcare records (ehr)internet;framework
1890	实体经济	Research on the Cross-Chain Model of Rice Supply Chain Supervision Based on Parallel Blockchain and Smart Contracts	Rice is one of the three major staple foods in the world, and the quality and safety of rice are related to the development of human beings. The new crown epidemic, pesticide residues, insect pests, and heavy metal pollution have a certain security impact on the food supply chain. The rice supply chain is characterized by a long life cycle; complex roles in the main links; many types of hazards; and multidimensional, multisource, and heterogeneous information. To strengthen the rice supply chain's supervision ability under the epidemic situation, a supervision cross-chain model suitable for the complicated data of the rice supply chain based on parallel blockchain theory and smart contract technology was built. Firstly, the data collected in the rice supply chain and different types of data stored in different parallel blockchains were analyzed. Secondly, based on data analysis, a collection/supervision cross-chain mechanism based on "hash lock + smart contract + relay chain", a concurrency mechanism based on the K-means algorithm and a Bloom filter, and a consensus mechanism suitable for multichain consensus named the Supervision Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SPBFT) were proposed. Furthermore, a cross-chain model of rice supply chain supervision was constructed. Finally, theoretical verification and simulation experiments were used to analyze the operation process, safety, cross-chain efficiency, and scalability of the model. The results showed that the application of parallel blockchains and smart contracts to supervision of rice supply chain information improved the convenience and security of information interaction between various links in the rice supply chain, the storage cost of supply chain data and the high latency of interaction was reduced, and the refined management of the rice supply chain data and personnel was realized. This research applied new information technology to the coordination and resource sharing of the food supply chain, and provides ideas for the digital transformation of the food industry.	rice supply chain;cross-chain supervision;smart contracts;blockchain;food safetytraceability system;food;internet;things;technology;management;safety
1891	协同技术	Federated Learning-Aware Multi-Objective Modeling and blockchain-enable system for IIoT applications	The study devises the Federated Learning Aware Multi-Objective Modeling in Decentralized Microservices Assisted IIoT System. Energy consumption and application delay have been taken as the study's objectives. The system proposes different schemes, such as Deadline Latency Energy. The work devises the Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Algorithm Framework (DLEBAF) with different strategies. The first strategy is deadline-efficient task sequencing and scheduling (DETS), which allocates all applications (workloads) according to their deadline. The second strategy is latency-efficient task scheduling (LETS) to minimize the latency of workloads. The third strategy is energy-efficient task scheduling (EETS), which reduces the energy of fog nodes. The blockchain-enabled fog-cloud (BEFC) scheme ensures the blockchain validation, hashing, previous hash, and time of applications in the system. The results will compare the optimal energy results and delay existing studies with the proposed work. Results showed that the proposed method improves by 30% energy and 50% training delay of all applications.	eets;dets;befc;microservice;iiot;blockchain;multi-objectives;fog;cloud;simulationfog;mechanism
1892	市场治理	Based on the Time-Spatial Power-Based Cryptocurrency Miner Driving Force Model, Establish a Global CO2 Emission Prediction Framework after China Bans Cryptocurrency	The energy consumption and carbon footprint of cryptocurrencies have always been a popular topic. However, most of the existing studies only focus on one cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and there is a lack of long-term monitoring studies that summarize all cryptocurrencies. By constructing a time series hash rate/power model, this research obtained the 10-year time series data on energy consumption dataset of global top-25 cryptocurrencies for the first time. Both the temporal coverage and the spatiotemporal resolution of the data exceed previous studies. The results show that Bitcoin's power consumption only accounts for 58% of the top-25 cryptocurrencies. After China bans cryptocurrencies, the conservative change in global CO2 emissions from 2020 will be between -0.4% and 4.4%, and Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan are likely to become areas of rapid growth in carbon emissions from cryptocurrencies.	bitcoin;electronic waste;bans cryptocurrency;co2 emissionbitcoin;sustainability;energy
1893	市场治理	Review of Offline Payment Function of CBDC Considering Security Requirements	Due to the growth of the internet and communication technologies, electronic financial systems are becoming popular. Physical cash is losing its preeminence, and digital numbers on computers represent money. However, electronic financial systems, mostly operated by private entities, have defects to be compensated for, such as high charges for using the system, security issues, and the problem of exclusion. As a solution, many countries around the world are considering central bank digital currency. For central bank digital currency to be utilized as a national legal tender, it must be universal and accessible regardless of time and place, similar to physical cash. Therefore, offline payment functions that extend the accessibility of central bank digital currency are becoming attractive. However, due to the characteristics of the electronic financial system, central bank digital currency is vulnerable to possible malicious behaviors in offline situations, such as blackouts and system shutdowns. This paper reviews research studies that deal with security matters related to the offline payment function of central bank digital currency. Offline payment solutions, including central bank digital currency and other electronic financial systems, such as electronic cash and cryptocurrency, are reviewed, and supplemental methods to improve the offline payment solutions of central bank digital currency based on trusted execution environment devices are suggested.	central bank digital currency (cbdc);offline payment function;security requirements;blockchain;electronic financial systems;trusted execution environment (tee)ddos attacks;non-repudiation;classification

The distributed generations in some localities, however, lack connection to the utility grid due to the remoteness of the generation site. Certain benefits are, however, threatened. Thus, where there is no energy price regulation policy, fluctuations in energy prices could be the order of the day. This paper, thus, focuses on the transaction price optimization of the standalone distributed generations using the game theory approach. First, blockchain technology is incorporated in the energy transaction arena to bind prosumers and their energy transactions to a common platform. Next, for electricity price prediction, the linear regression algorithm is used to obtain the fitting equation from the current transaction data stored by the blockchain network. Using the fitting equation as the objective function, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to achieve the proposed energy transaction price minimization and profit maximization. Finally, the individual hourly optimization results are fitted by a decision tree algorithm for instant referencing purposes in making energy best price transaction decisions. The individual results show that it is capable of constantly updating the optimized energy price in real-time based on the subsequent transaction records updated by the blockchain network.	blockchains;costs;optimization;distributed power generation;resilience;pricing;microgrids;blockchain transaction;decision tree regression;linear regression;particle swarm optimization;standalone distributed energy generations;transaction price optimizationtechnology;management
1895	技术治理	A Novel Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Method Based on Information Graph and Ensemble Learning	Blockchain presents a chance to address  the security and privacy issues of the Internet of Things; however, blockchain itself has certain security issues. How to accurately identify smart contract vulnerabilities is one of the key issues at hand. Most existing methods require large-scale data support to avoid overfitting; machine learning (ML) models trained on small-scale vulnerability data are often difficult to produce satisfactory results in smart contract vulnerability prediction. However, in the real world, collecting contractual vulnerability data requires huge human and time costs. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposed an ensemble learning (EL)-based contract vulnerability prediction method, which is based on seven different neural networks using contract vulnerability data for contract-level vulnerability detection. Seven neural network (NN) models were first pretrained using an information graph (IG) consisting of source datasets, which then were integrated into an ensemble model called Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection method based on Information Graph and Ensemble Learning (SCVDIE). The effectiveness of the SCVDIE model was verified using a target dataset composed of IG, and then its performances were compared with static tools and seven independent data-driven methods. The verification and comparison results show that the proposed SCVDIE method has higher accuracy and robustness than other data-driven methods in the target task of predicting smart contract vulnerabilities.	smart contract;vulnerability detection;blockchain security;operation flow;ensemble learning;information graphdiagnosis;model
1896	虚拟经济	Evaluating and forecasting the risks of small to medium-sized enterprises in the supply chain finance market using blockchain technology and deep learning model	The present work applies deep learning and blockchain technology to evaluate and control the risk of the supply chain finance market, to cope with the diversifications of the financial market development mode. Firstly, based on the relevant monetary inward theory, the potential risks are analyzed in the supply chain finance market. Besides, under the background of financial technology, the risk of the supply chain finance market is predicted and managed by intelligent technology. Secondly, the financing model of supply chain finance is analyzed to discuss the possible credit risk of supply chain finance. Meanwhile, the credit evaluation model of supply chain finance based on deep learning technology is constructed to predict the potential credit risk. Thirdly, blockchain technology is adopted to control and optimize the credit evaluation model to establish a credit system for supply chain enterprises with high credit and reliability and reduce potential supply chain financial risks. Finally, the designed model is simulated and tested. The experimental results show that the credit evaluation model of supply chain finance has a fitting effect of 0.989 on the sample data, indicating that it can effectively analyze the data. Result analysis shows that the designed model can effectively predict the potential credit risk of the enterprise. Moreover, a stable and reliable credit relationship network is established for supply chain finance by blockchain technology, which enhances the reliability of logistics transactions, and reduces potential risks faced by supply chain finance. The model provides effective technical means for studying the credit risk of supply chain finance.	blockchain technology (bt);credit risk control (crc);supply chain finance (scf);backpropagation neural network (bpnn)prediction;internet
1897	实体经济	Blockchain Technologies and Digitalization in Function of Student Work Evaluation	Following COVID-19, new accreditation standards include digitization, entrepreneurship, social inclusion and the circular economy. Blockchain can help to simplify difficult accreditation processes that ensure worldwide teaching, learning, practice and business communication excellence. The paper proposes a Collaborative Learning and Student Work Evaluation (CLSWE) model based on blockchain technologies (BCTs) encompassing selected concepts from the scientific research peer-review process. BCTs are used to develop a safe platform for storing and exchanging data about students' projects and evaluations. The CLSWE model offers the possibility of improving cooperation between higher-education institutions and companies that seek the "employable skills" of proactive students. Before implementing the CLSWE model, a questionnaire was conducted to survey lecturers about their attitudes related to the potential application of BCTs. The results of the surveys are encouraging and reveal a desire and willingness to introduce BCTs in education. A project scheme with the main functionalities of the model and a description of the roles of the prominent participants was designed. A platform with a database created in the MySQL language for the testing model was built. This research also contributes to higher education literature in terms of the sustainability of the education process and collaborative learning with BCTs.	blockchain technologies;collaborative learning;digitalization;education process;peer assessment;qr codeonline peer assessment;higher-education;framework;sector;rule
1898	核心技术	Trusted Blockchain-Driven IoT Security Consensus Mechanism	Single point of failure and node attack tend to cause instability in the centralized Internet of Things (IoT). Combined with blockchain technology, the deficiency of traditional IoT architecture can be effectively alleviated. However, the existing blockchain consensus mechanism still has the problems of forks and wasting of computing power. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework based on a two-stage credit calculation to handle these problems. Notably, the nodes are selected through the model, and these nodes will compete on the chain according to the behavior of participating in the creation of the block. Then, a comparative simulation with the existing consensus mechanism proof of work (PoW) is presented. The results show that the proposed framework can quickly eliminate malicious nodes, maintain the overall security of the blockchain and reduce consensus delay.	blockchain;iot;rrust model;pot
1899	核心技术	A probable cheating-free (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme with enhanced blockchain	A cheating-free (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme using Blockchain is presented, where Shamir's technique is followed and the Blockchain vulnerabilities due to PoW/PoS (Proof-ofWork/Stake) consensus, are removed. We address the shares' cheating issues and design a Blockchain based SS scheme, in which the participants' shares are recorded secretly in a block and the dealer's identity along with other parameters are made visible through the genesis block. Our scheme uses a short-length Blockchain comprising 2 blocks per secret negotiation session. The main objectives are to improve Shamir's secret sharing scheme with Blockchain such that the cheating activities from dealer and/or participants become infeasible, and to enhance Blockchain technology with a consensus mechanism using Blockchain based SS scheme such that insecurity of PoW/PoS consensus are avoidable. The security and performance analysis of the scheme are provided. Although Blockchain increases some overheads, it makes a complete cheating-free SS scheme.	secret sharing scheme;lagrange polynomial interpolation;blockchain technology;pow and pos consensus;threshold cryptography;key management
1900	实体经济	Blockchain-enabled traceability and producer's incentive to outsource delivery	Applications of the blockchain technology in supply chains have attracted extensive attention in both academia and industries. However, little research has investigated the effects of the blockchain technology on firms' operational strategies. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of the traceability enabled by the blockchain technology on a producer's decision whether to outsource delivery to a third-party logistics firm. We find that without the blockchain technology, the logistics firm has a moral hazard-an incentive to set the delivery quality at the lowest level even though improving the delivery quality is for free. The traceability enabled by the blockchain technology can resolve the logistics firm's moral hazard and encourage the producer to improve the production quality. Furthermore, when the delivery is cost-efficient for the producer, the traceability enabled by the blockchain technology motivates the producer to outsource the delivery to the logistics firm; otherwise, the producer's outsourcing decision is not affected. When quality cost is low, the blockchain technology makes the logistics firm improve its delivery quality significantly and encourages the producer to improve the production quality. When the quality cost is moderate, only under certain conditions, the blockchain technology has effects on both parties' decisions.	blockchain technology;traceability;quality management;outsourcing;operations managementquality management;supply chains;logistics;transport;design
1901	实体经济	Adoption of technological innovation and recycling practices in automobile sector: under the Covid-19 pandemic	Rising environmental concerns and globalization of supply chain made their control and management difficult. Blockchain technology, as a distributed digital ledger technology, guarantees security, visibility, traceability, and transparency promises ease for environmental and global supply chain problems. In this research work, blockchain technology and business analytics techniques were critically analyzed in the context of supply chain. Global and local governmental bodies, consumers, and communities are putting pressure to meet sustainability goals, which prompts us to investigate how these technologies can address and aid remanufacturing and recycling practices and sustainability in supply chain. The results illustrate that advanced technologies have a key role in the implementation of remanufacturing and recycling practices. The results also indicate that the remanufacturing and recycling practices substantially improve automobile firm performance. Moreover, the results also indicated that Covid-19 pandemic has positive moderating effect between advanced technology and remanufacturing and recycling practices while having insignificant effect between remanufacturing and recycling practices and automobile firm performance.	technological innovation;recycling practices;automobile sector;covid-19 pandemicsmart manufacturing systems;industry 4.0 technologies;supply chain management;circular economy;sustainability;performance;challenges;blockchain;framework;enablers
1902	实体经济	Review of Blockchain Potential Applications in the Electricity Sector and Challenges for Large Scale Adoption	Blockchain technology applications in the electricity sector are getting considerable attention from both academia and industry. It is expected that blockchain will play an important role in the transition to the smart grid. The blockchain applications in the electricity sector can be classified to optimizing existing processes like metering and billing or grid management and using blockchain for emerging applications such as creating new platforms for value exchange like peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. This paper briefly introduces the fundamentals of blockchain technology, such as different types of blockchain networks and consensus mechanisms, in addition to introducing a few blockchain platforms that are widely used in current studies, projects, and startups or may have future potential in the electricity sector applications. The contribution of this paper is to provide a review of potential applications of blockchain in many electricity sector use cases, and they are categorized into eight categories such as P2P energy trading, wholesale markets, retail markets, metering and billing, trading of renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon credits, electric mobility, enhancement of power system cyber security, investments in renewable energy sources (RESs), and power system operation and management. Moreover, examples of research studies, pilot projects, industrial projects, startups, or companies investigating the blockchain capabilities at each potential application are introduced. Furthermore, the studies presented in each use case are compared to clarify and highlight the blockchain functions and involved actors. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges that blockchain technology is facing that obstruct large-scale adoption in different sectors and in the electricity sector specifically and potential solutions to these challenges that are being developed.	blockchains;power systems;electric potential;peer-to-peer computing;investment;industries;companies;blockchain applications;distributed ledger technologies;distributed ledger technologies applications;peer-to-peer energy trading;local electricity markets;electric vehicles;smart gridenergy;security;system;peer;communication;management;framework;iot
1903	协同技术	Research on the Millionaires' Problem under the Malicious Model Based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography	With the rapid development of blockchain, big data, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence, the security of multisource data collaborative computing has become increasingly prominent. Secure multiparty computing has become the core technology of privacy collaborative computing. Millionaires' problem is the cornerstone of secure multiparty computation. Firstly, this paper proposes a 0-1 coding rule, which is used to solve the millionaires' problem under the semihonest model. Aiming at the possible malicious behaviors of the protocol under the semihonest model, the millionaires' problem protocol under the malicious model based on the elliptic curve cryptography is designed by using cryptographic tools such as the zero-knowledge proof and the cut-choose method. This protocol not only can effectively solve the millionaires' problem but also can safely and effectively prevent malicious behaviors. Meanwhile, the security ordering designed by the protocol can be effectively applied to a quality evaluation in the blockchain.	
1904	协同技术	User Sensitive Information Protection Scheme Based on Blockchain Technology	With the continuous development of mobile applications and location technology, k-anonymity technology is usually used to protect the privacy and security of users in location-based services that are used by mobile users. Due to the self-interest of users, in the cooperative construction of a k-anonymity privacy protection scheme, it is difficult to guarantee the honest cooperation behavior of the requesting and cooperating users. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a distributed k-anonymous location privacy protection scheme based on blockchain. In this paper, we record the requesting users, cooperative users, and their location information as evidence, and we punish the users with location leakage and deception. An anonymous zone cannot be constructed when the user is a requesting user. An interactive record mechanism is designed to constrain the self-interest behavior of the requesting and cooperating users in the process of anonymous region construction. Security analysis and experiments show that this scheme can effectively protect the user's location privacy, promote the honest cooperation between the requesting user and the cooperative user, and encourage more users to participate in the construction of an anonymous zone.	location privacy protection;security
1905	实体经济	Theoretical and practical applications of blockchain in healthcare information management	A primary objective of blockchain technology is to address information security and efficiency issues related to existing information sharing systems. For the sharing of health records, little is known about the application of blockchain in management information systems. There are strict regulations for sharing health information due to insecure systems and privacy concerns. To significantly and effectively improve medical diagnosis, it is beneficial to have efficient, reliable, and accurate accessibility to a patient's full medical history. Due to concerns with the security of health systems and privacy concerns, medical histories are not always accessible to healthcare providers. To help increase accessibility options, this research proposes a blockchain-based model that facilitates sharing medical records in a manner that is beneficial to both healthcare providers and patients. Social exchange theory provides the theoretical support for the conceptual model presented. Experimental findings based on 151 participants revealed that the blockchain technology can provide a secure information system and increase patient motivation to share medical records. To show the applicability of the proposed use of blockchain from a practical managerial perspective, we show feasibility by developing an Android software application.	blockchain;health management information systems;security perception;motivation;social exchange theoryrecord;security;implementation;intentions;adoption;system
1906	实体经济	SHARIF: Solid Pod-Based Secured Healthcare Information Storage and Exchange Solution in Internet of Things	The recent development has enlightened health informatics on the Internet of medical Things (IoT) 5.0. Healthcare services have seen greater acceptance of information and communications technology (ICT) in recent years; in light of the increasing volume of patient data, the traditional way of storing data in physical files has eventually moved to a digital alternative such as electronic health record (EHR). However, conventional healthcare data systems are plagued with a single point of failure, security issues, mutable logging, and inefficient methods to retrieve healthcare records. Social linked data (Solid) has been developed as a decentralized technology to alter digital data sharing and ownership for its users radically. However, Solid alone cannot address all the security issues posed to data exchange and storage. Present research combines two decentralized technologies, Solid ecosystem and blockchain technology, to tackle all potential security issues using solidity-based smart contracts, thereby providing a secure patient-centric design for the complex under developing EHR data exchange.	blockchains;medical services;solids;security;memory;servers;stakeholders;blockchain technology;decentralization;healthcare data;social linked data (solid) personal online datastores (pod);solidityblockchain
1907	实体经济	A Blockchain-Based Privacy Preservation Scheme in Mobile Medical	With the rapid development of mobile medical, how to establish an effective security mechanism to protect data security and privacy while users enjoy medical services has become an urgent problem to be solved. Aiming at the easy leakage of privacy in mobile medical terminals and untrustworthy data, we make use of a role-separated mechanism to generate trusted anonymous certificates. We propose a lightweight identity authentication scheme and adopt blockchain to protect the security of medical data. Meanwhile, in view of the problems of transparency and visibility of blockchain information, we adapt the searchable encryption algorithm to realize ciphertext processing in the whole life cycle. Experiments show that our scheme can reduce the cost of computation on the basis of ensuring traffic. In the process of dynamic updating of ciphertext keywords, except the keyword identifier, less information is leaked to the server, which protects privacy of users.	secure

The scheme contains a two-phase authentication mechanism in which requests are first validated using a cuckoo filter, followed by a timestamp nonce. Secure accumulation is achieved by validating models using a Hampel filter and loss checks. To increase the privacy of the model, differential privacy is employed before sharing. Finally, the model is stored in the blockchain after consent is obtained from mining nodes. Experiments are performed in a proper environment, and the results confirm the feasibility of the proposed scheme.	drones;blockchains;data models;training;servers;logic gates;authentication;blockchain;dew computing;differential privacy;drone;federated learning;internet of things;long short-term memory
1909	市场治理	A Deep Learning-Based Action Recommendation Model for Cryptocurrency Profit Maximization	Research on the prediction of cryptocurrency prices has been actively conducted, as cryptocurrencies have attracted considerable attention. Recently, researchers have aimed to improve the performance of price prediction methods by applying deep learning-based models. However, most studies have focused on predicting cryptocurrency prices for the following day. Therefore, clients are inconvenienced by the necessity of rapidly making complex decisions on actions that support maximizing their profit, such as "Sell", "Buy", and "Wait". Furthermore, very few studies have explored the use of deep learning models to make recommendations for these actions, and the performance of such models remains low. Therefore, to solve these problems, we propose a deep learning model and three input features: sellProfit, buyProfit, and maxProfit. Through these concepts, clients are provided with criteria on which action would be most beneficial at a given current time. These criteria can be used as decision-making indices to facilitate profit maximization. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, daily price data of six representative cryptocurrencies were used to conduct an experiment. The results confirm that the proposed model showed approximately 13% to 21% improvement over existing methods and is statistically significant.	cryptocurrency;bitcoin;bitcoin price prediction;deep learning;input feature;decision making;profitprediction;bitcoin;scheme
1910	市场治理	On technical trading and social media indicators for cryptocurrency price classification through deep learning	Predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies is a notoriously challenging task due to high volatility and new mechanisms characterising the crypto markets. In this work, we focus on the two major cryptocurrencies for market capitalisation at the time of the study, Ethereum and Bitcoin, for the period 2017-2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the predictability of price movements comparing four different deep learning algorithms (Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short Term Memory (ALSTM)). We use three classes of features, considering a combination of technical (e.g. opening and closing prices), trading (e.g. moving averages) and social (e.g. users' sentiment) indicators as input to our classification algorithm. We compare a restricted model composed of technical indicators only, and an unrestricted model including technical, trading and social media indicators. We found an increase in accuracy for the daily classification task from a range of 51%-55% for the restricted model to 67%-84% for the unrestricted one. This study demonstrates that including both trading and social media indicators yields a significant improvement in the prediction and accuracy consistently across all algorithms.	cryptocurrencies;text analysis;deep learning;social media indicators;trading indicatorsbitcoin
1911	市场治理	Jointly forecasting the value-at-risk and expected shortfall of Bitcoin with a regime-switching CAViaR model	We explore the dynamic tail risk in the Bitcoin market by jointly estimating value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) using the conditional autoregressive value-at-risk (CAViaR) model. To enable more accurate measurement, we construct a Markov regime-switching (MS) model in which the time-varying transition probability is driven by the information contained in asset price bubbles. This is motivated by prior evidence that bubbles are a key indicator of the economic cycle and contain important information on systemic risk. Using daily Bitcoin data from 2013 to 2021, the results provide strong evidence of a form of regime change in Bitcoin's VaR and ES. Furthermore, the bubble index has a significant impact on tail risk and improves the model's ability to estimate and predict VaR and ES.	caviar;bitcoin;bubble index;markov regime-switching models
1912	市场治理	Evolutionary correlation, regime switching, spectral dynamics and optimal trading strategies for cryptocurrencies and equities	This paper uses new and recently established methodologies to study the evolutionary dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, and compares the findings with that of the equity market. We begin by applying random matrix theory and principal components analysis (PCA) to correlation matrices of both collections, highlighting clear differences in the eigenspectra exhibited. We then explore the heterogeneity of both asset classes, studying the time-varying dynamics of underlying sector behaviours, and determine the collective similarity within each collection. We then turn to a study of structural break dynamics and evolutionary power spectra, where we quantify the collective affinity in structural breaks and evolutionary behaviours of underlying sector time series. Finally, we implement two algorithms simulating 'portfolio choice' dynamics to compare the effectiveness of stock selection and sector allocation in cryptocurrency portfolios. There, we highlight the importance of both endeavours and comment on noteworthy implications for cryptocurrency portfolio management. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

1913	市场治理	Connectedness between Gold and Cryptocurrencies in COVID-19 Pandemic: A Frequency-Dependent Asymmetric and Causality Analysis	We employ a frequency-dependent asymmetric and causality analysis to investigate the connectedness between gold and cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, the variational mode decomposition-based quantile regression is utilised. Findings from the study divulge that the variational mode functions at the lower quantiles are mostly significant and negative indicating that gold acts as a safe haven, a diversifier at most market conditions with insignificant coefficients, and a hedge at normal market conditions for most cryptocurrencies at various investment horizons. Particularly, hedging benefits mostly occur in the short- and medium-term for Bitcoin and Ripple, as well as Bitcoin and Dogecoin in the long-term with gold. This implies that there is high persistence in the hedging properties of gold with Bitcoin, followed by Ripple. We notice more significant relationship between gold and some cryptocurrencies in the long-term of the COVID-19 pandemic relative to the medium-term emphasising the delayed responses of prices to information. Investors are recommended to be observant and mindful of investing in these markets due to the different dynamics.	mode decomposition;granger causality;safe haven;stocks;hedge;bonds;ghana;oil
1914	市场治理	The anatomy of a fee change-evidence from cryptocurrency markets	We analyze the impact on liquidity and trading activity of the introduction of maker fees (and simultaneous reduction of taker fees) on a leading cryptocurrency trading platform. Cryptocurrency markets are special because they are non-intermediated and highly fragmented. Furthermore, for the currency pair we analyze (BTC-USD) the relative minimum tick size is negligible, a feature which allows us to derive predictions from the Colliard and Foucault (2012) model which assumes a zero minimum tick size. Consistent with the model we find that quoted spreads increase after the fee change. However, the increase is overcompensated by the decrease in taker fees. Quoted depth and the number of transactions decrease while the average trade size increases.	cryptocurrencies;trading fees;market liquidity;tick sizeliquidity;costs

The TVM-aGAS model is particularly suitable for processing the fat-tailed and extreme volatility characteristics of cryptocurrency returns. We then apply it to Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting of three cryptocurrencies, obtaining testing results that show our model possesses advantages in forecasting the density of daily cryptocurrency returns. Compared to other benchmarked models, the proposed model performs well in forecasting out-of-sample VaR. The findings underscore that our method is a useful and reliable alternative for forecasting VaR in cryptocurrencies.	time-varying mixture model;accelerating generalized autoregressive score;cryptocurrency markets;risk management;value-at-risk
1916	实体经济	A Peer-2-Peer Management and Secure Policy of the Energy Internet in Smart Microgrids	A peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading (ET) scheme has been presented in numerous scenarios within the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), such as vehicle-to-grid network, microgrids, and energy harvesting network. These scenarios present security and privacy issues because of the lack of trust and transparency in the energy markets. In this article, a secure ET system named energy blockchain (EBC) is proposed in order to overcome the security issues. An EBC is suitable for P2P ET situations in which trusted intermediaries are not needed. Similarly, a credit-based payment method to help eliminate ET delays due to transaction confirmation delays on the EBC is proposed. In addition, an optimal pricing method according to the Stackelberg game has been suggested for credit-based loans. According to a real dataset, security analysis and numerical outcomes indicate that the suggested blockchain and payment layout based on credit are both effective and safe in IIoT.	industrial internet of things;vehicle-to-grid;blockchains;privacy;layout;servers;pricing;blockchain (bc);energy trading (et);industrial internet of things (iiot);privacy and security;stackelberg gameblockchain

In this study, a price-based model is presented that organically integrates BC and MG for solving the issue of insufficient utilization of power in MG gaming competitions. Its convergence accuracy and search ability are high. In addition, two of the most significant players on the market will be utilized as research objects in order to build a real multi sources mini-MG network to address the actual time energy costs issue.

1918	虚拟经济	Optimization of University Financial Services Using the Blockchain Technology	At present, the financial work of most colleges and universities is facing the dilemma of low intelligence level. The financial sharing mode of colleges and universities using blockchain technology can effectively supervise their financial management while solving the problems of high costs related to financial sharing services, hidden dangers of data security, and low efficiency. Therefore, this paper makes an in-depth study on the application of blockchain technology and the financial sharing service mode of colleges and universities. Firstly, the University Financial Sharing Service Center platform based on blockchain technology is constructed. Furthermore, each module of the service center platform is described. Combined with the constructed platform, university finance is deeply mined by using the mining algorithm based on certain association rules, which is convenient for effective management. Finally, an artificial intelligence algorithm is used to adaptively optimize financial management. Similarly, the planning model and fitting algorithm of the least square method are used to control the risk of the financial management so as to realize the optimization of the financial sharing service mode. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the efficiency of the financial sharing service and reduce the potential safety problems and costs of financial management.	management;networks
1919	核心技术	Trusted consensus protocol for blockchain networks based on fuzzy inference system	Blockchain technology with its inherent security features revolutionizes the field of distributed networks and has become one of the significant areas of research. To preserve the security features and to maintain its global state, consensus mechanisms are very essential and are performed by a set of peers in the underlying network called miners. Therefore, the miners need to be a trusted entity and their trustworthiness plays a vital role in preserving the security of the asset ledger. To ensure trusted nodes perform the consensus process, fuzzy-based trust models are robust and effective. Therefore, fuzzy inference system-based trusted consensus mechanism (FISTCON) is proposed as an effective security solution resulting in a fast and secure consensus process. The proposed scheme works in two phases. In phase 1, a fuzzy-based trust model that includes transaction history and trust feedback (F-THTF trust model) to identify trusted miners for consensus is proposed. In phase 2, a fuzzy-based effective practical byzantine fault tolerance (F-EpBFT) consensus protocol with an optimized broadcasting mechanism to decrease the communication overhead is proposed. The proposed work is implemented in the Hyperledger fabric framework, and the outcomes are thoroughly analyzed to prove the efficiency of the proposed scheme in a variety of scenarios.	blockchain;fuzzy inference system;trust model;consensus;hyperledger fabricchallenges
1920	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Model for Intelligent Supply Chain Production and Distribution	Blockchain is a term in the field of information technology. In essence, it is a shared database, and the data or information stored in it has the characteristics of "unforgeable," "full traces," "traceable," "open and transparent," and "collective maintenance." Based on these characteristics, blockchain technology has laid a solid "trust" foundation, created a reliable "cooperation" mechanism, and has broad application prospects. This paper is aimed at studying a method in view of the integrate of system analysis and system simulation to solve the problems in the production and distribution (P&D) system in the supply chain, proposing a more realistic optimization plan, and then promoting it to various enterprises. This article proposes the idea of using supply chain management, through system analysis, system simulation, case analysis, and comparative research methods, starting from the strategic level, tactical level, and operation level of supply chain management to optimize the P&D system. Pay attention to the P&D system issues in the supply chain environment, and apply the method of system analysis and system simulation to get a better P&D plan. The experimental results of this paper show that the total cost of the supplier selection strategy is 5.204 million yuan, and the delayed delivery rate is 30%. The new reconstruction strategy makes the total cost as low as 3,809,700 yuan, and the total delayed delivery rate is as low as 7%.

1922	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Secure Data Storage Protocol for Sensors in the Industrial Internet of Things	The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) that introduces Internet of Things (IoT) technology into industrial environments is beneficial to construct smart factories. It utilizes various sensors to collect the data of industrial devices. These data are analyzed to improve the manufacturing efficiency and product quality. Cloud storage provides a solution for storing data outsourced, especially for sensors that have limited local storage and computational capacity. To ensure the privacy preserving of devices, the collected data should be stored in the formal ciphertext. Therefore, encrypted data sharing should be implemented to analyze the devices' data. In this article, the cloud storage solution for sensors is considered. To achieve a secure and efficient data storage and sharing, a novel group signature scheme, which has less computation overhead and communication overhead, is designed to realize anonymous authentication first. And then, a novel blockchain-based cloud storage protocol for sensors in IIoT is constructed on basis of the proposed group signature scheme. Smart contract and proxy re-encryption are utilized in this protocol to realize secure data sharing with a less computational overhead. Furthermore, security proofs and performance evaluations demonstrate that this protocol is secure, privacy-preserving, and has at least 40% and 20% performance improvement in data storage and sharing phase, respectively.	sensors;cloud computing;industrial internet of things;blockchains;security;intelligent sensors;access control;blockchain;cloud storage;group signature;industrial internet of things (iiot);sensorshealth-care;authentication

During the high energy demand, Vehicle to Grid (V2G) comprises a notable feature that returns the stored energy back to the grid. However, due to dynamic nature of energy prices and EVs availability, determining the best charging and discharging strategy is quite difficult. The existing approaches need a model to predict the uncertainty and optimize the scheduling problem. Further, other issues like security, scalability, and real-time data accessibility of EVs energy trading (ET) data at low cost also exist. Though many solutions exist, they are not adequate to handle the aforementioned issues. This paper proposes a Secure V2G-Energy Trading (SV2G-ET) scheme using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Ethereum Blockchain Technology (EBT). The proposed SV2G-ET scheme employs a deep Q-network for EVs scheduling for charging/discharging. SV2G-ET scheme uses InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and smart contract (SC) for secure access of EV's ET data in real time. The experimental results prove the efficacy of the proposed SV2G-ET scheme that leads to improved scalability, saving the EVs charging cost, low ET data storage cost, and increased EV owner's profit.	electric vehicles;blockchain
1924	实体经济	Blockchain-Based Information Supervision Model for Rice Supply Chains	Rice is a major food crop around the world, and its various quality and safety problems are closely related to human health. As an important area of food safety research, the rice supply chain has attracted increasing attention. Based on blockchain technology, this study investigated problems of data privacy and circulation efficiency caused by complex rice supply networks, long circulation cycles, and various risk factors in each link. First, we deconstructed the quality and safety of each link of the rice supply chain at the information level and established a key information classification table for each link. On that basis, we built a rice supply chain information supervision model based on blockchain. Various encryption algorithms are used to secure the sensitive data of enterprises in the supply chain to meet regulators' needs for efficient supervision. Moreover, we propose a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm that scores the credit of enterprise nodes, optimizes the selection strategy of master nodes, and ensures high efficiency and low cost. Then, we built a prototype system based on the open-source framework of hyperledger fabric, analyzed the model's viability, and implemented the system using cases. The results indicated that the proposed system can optimize the information supervision process of rice supply chain regulators and provide a feasible solution for the quality and safety supervision of grain and oil.	encoder-decoder;food;traceability;network;trade
1925	实体经济	Blockchain-based group key agreement protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks	Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) has been attracting widespread attention because of its ability to improve traffic efficiency and safety. Since insecure wireless communication channels face various security threats (eavesdropping, tampering, forgery attack, etc.), many group key agreement protocols have been proposed for VANET. However, most of them rely on a trusted authority (TA) to perform authentication or group key generation. Excessive dependence on TA may lead to a single point of failure. Therefore, this paper designs a decentralized group key agreement protocol to solve this problem. TA is not involved in authentication or key agreement process after user registration. With blockchain technology, rode-side unit (RSU) and onboard units (OBUs) within its communication range can negotiate a group key without private information leakage. Moreover, the proposed protocol supports dynamic management (verification, update, and revocation) of vehicles' public keys. Formal security proof demonstrates that the proposed protocol meets basic security requirements. Besides, performance evaluation and comparison show that the proposed protocol requires lower computation costs and communication overheads than some existing protocols.	vehicular ad hoc network;group key agreement;single point of failure;blockchain;authenticationscheme
1926	实体经济	A Secured Industrial Internet-of-Things Architecture Based on Blockchain Technology and Machine Learning for Sensor Access Control Systems in Smart Manufacturing	Featured Application A potential application of the work concerns the development of secure IIoT architectures for smart manufacturing using blockchain technology and machine learning algorithms. In this paper, a layered architecture incorporating Blockchain technology (BCT) and Machine Learning (ML) is proposed in the context of the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) for smart manufacturing applications. The proposed architecture is composed of five layers covering sensing, network/protocol, transport enforced with BCT components, application and advanced services (i.e., BCT data, ML and cloud) layers. BCT enables gathering sensor access control information, while ML brings its effectivity in attack detection such as DoS (Denial of Service), DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), injection, man in the middle (MitM), brute force, cross-site scripting (XSS) and scanning attacks by employing classifiers differentiating between normal and malicious activity. The design of our architecture is compared to similar ones in the literature to point out potential benefits. Experiments, based on the IIoT dataset, have been conducted to evaluate our contribution, using four metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are evaluated regarding these four metrics. Even if more experiments are required, it is illustrated that the proposed architecture can reduce significantly the number of DDoS, injection, brute force and XSS attacks and threats within an advanced framework for sensor access control in IIoT networks based on a smart contract along with ML classifiers.	blockchain;industrial iot;smart manufacturing;security threats;security solutions;machine learning;classifiers;privacy;smart contract;access controliot
1927	协同技术	A Secret Sharing-Based Distributed Cloud System for Privacy Protection	Based on the rapid development of cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and wireless networks, smart cities have been able to develop exponentially faster. The convergence of cloud computing and IoT net-works has accelerated the development of smart environments such as smart cities and smart homes. However, the expansion of smart cities generates a large amount of data which created numerous issues in the cloud, including big data processing, storage, security, and privacy. This paper proposes a multi-cloud system to which data distribution sharing is applied. The proposed system applies a data distribution sharing algorithm that distributes and stores data by applying secret sharing or interplanetary file systems depending on the type of data. Since data is divided and stored in distributed cloud storage, data can be safely protected in case of a cyber-attacks or single point of failure on one cloud storage. In addition, we apply one-time password protocol (OTIP) algorithms to secure data communication. OTIP is a one-time password-based IP address modification algorithm that continuously changes IP addresses for secure data communication. Finally, we prove the necessity of the proposed cloud system through qualitative analysis and simulation.	secret sharing;interplanerary file system;one time password;data distribution sharing;data managementblockchain;framework
1928	实体经济	ROS-Ethereum: A Convenient Tool to Bridge ROS and Blockchain (Ethereum)	Robot Operating System (ROS) has received widespread utilization with the development of robotics, self-driving, etc., recently. Meanwhile, the other technology blockchain is frequently applied to various fields with its trustworthy characteristics and immutability in data storage. However, ROS has no ability to interact with the blockchain, which hinders research in related fields. Therefore, we wonder if we can develop a convenient tool to bridge ROS and blockchain. Inspired by this, we propose ROS-Ethereum. It bridges ROS and Ethereum, a widely used blockchain platform. ROS-Ethereum is based on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) communication mechanism and the SM algorithm family along with Ethereum technology. Simply put, ROS-Ethereum allows users to invoke the contract when interacting with the blockchain, which makes this process easier and safer. We conduct experiments in real robots to verify the effectiveness of ROS-Ethereum and evaluate it from the following metrics: (1) the encryption efficiency and stability of the algorithm and (2) ROS-Ethereum transaction response time and packet loss rate.	systems
1929	核心技术	On Designing Smart Agents for Service Provisioning in Blockchain-Powered Systems	Service provisioning systems assign users to service providers according to allocation criteria that strike an optimal trade-off between users' Quality of Experience (QoE) and the operation cost endured by providers. These systems have been leveraging Smart Contracts (SCs) to add trust and transparency to their criteria. However, deploying fixed allocation criteria in SCs does not necessarily lead to the best performance over time since the blockchain participants join and leave flexibly, and their load varies with time, making the original allocation sub-optimal. Furthermore, updating the criteria manually at every variation in the blockchain jeopardizes the autonomous and independent execution promised by SCs. Thus, we propose a set of light-weight agents for SCs that are capable of optimizing the performance. We also propose using online learning SCs, empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, that leverage the chained data to continuously self-tune its allocation criteria. We show that the proposed learning-assisted method achieves superior performance on the combinatorial multi-stage allocation problem while still being executable in real-time. We also compare the proposed approach with standard heuristics as well as planning methods. Results show a significant performance advantage over heuristics and better adaptability to the dynamic nature of blockchain networks.	blockchains;resource management;costs;task analysis;peer-to-peer computing;vehicle dynamics;smart contracts;iot;blockchain;smart contracts;service provisioning;deep reinforcement learning;edge computinginternet;model;iot

Hence, the adoption of Blockchain is becoming an increasingly significant topic. The number of publications discussing the potential of Blockchain adoption has been expanding significantly. In addition, not enough attention has been given to Blockchain adoption in the software development industry. As a result, a systematic overview to investigate the research trends in this area is needed. This study uses a Scientometric analysis and critical review to examine the evolution of Blockchain adoption research on the Web of Science Principal Collection. In addition, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify gaps in Blockchain adoption research and the top reasons for adopting Blockchain with the intention of proposing a sustainable adoption framework. This study extends the body of knowledge by discussing the most influential countries, authors, organizations, publication themes, and most cited publications on Blockchain adoption research. Additionally, this study identifies the 30 relevant studies from the Web of Science and Scopus, including their industries, countries, methods, and respondent sample size, and the top 18 adoption factors among them. Consequently, this study proposes a suitable Blockchain adoption framework based on these top 18 factors.

1931	协同技术	Algorithm-Level Confidentiality for Average Consensus on Time-Varying Directed Graphs	Average consensus plays a key role in distributed networks, with applications ranging from time synchronization, information fusion, load balancing, to decentralized control. Existing average consensus algorithms require individual agents to exchange explicit state values with their neighbors, which leads to the undesirable disclosure of sensitive information in the state. In this paper, we propose a novel average consensus algorithm for time-varying directed graphs that can protect the confidentiality of a participating agent against other participating agents. The algorithm injects randomness in interaction to obfuscate information on the algorithm-level and can ensure information-theoretic privacy without the assistance of any trusted third party or data aggregator. By leveraging the inherent robustness of consensus dynamics against random variations in interaction, our proposed algorithm can also guarantee the accuracy of average consensus. The algorithm is distinctly different from differential-privacy based average consensus approaches which enable confidentiality through compromising accuracy in obtained consensus value. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.	directed graphs;heuristic algorithms;network topology;consensus algorithm;topology;synchronization;privacy;average consensus;confidentiality;time-varying directed graphsoptimization
1932	协同技术	A privacy protection scheme for electricity transactions in the microgrid day-ahead market based on consortium blockchain	The electricity trading plan made by the users in the microgrid day-ahead market (DAM) contains the electricity consumption information of the future day. Aiming at the problem that the leakage of electricity consumption information threatens the privacy security of users and the leakage of electricity trading plan destroys the fairness of the DAM, a privacy protection scheme for electricity transactions in microgrid DAM based on con-sortium blockchain is proposed. Firstly, the scheme is based on the ElGamal algorithm that generates anonymous identities for users involved in transactions, preventing leakage of electricity consumption information and allowing the real identity of the fraudster to be traced in the event of fraudulent transactions. Secondly, a cer-tificateless signcryption (CLS) algorithm is improved to realize the encryption and authentication of the user's electricity trading plan, which enhances the efficiency of the scheme. Finally, the scheme realizes decentralized trading of users in the microgrid in the DAM through the consortium blockchain and smart contracts, ensuring transaction security and improving transaction efficiency. The scheme is proved to have high security under different types of attacks by stochastic prediction machine model. Moreover, by calculating the computation time for different kinds of operations in the two stages of signcryption and unsigncryption, it is concluded that the computation cost of this scheme is lower than that of other schemes of the same type has higher efficiency.	microgrid day-ahead market;electricity transaction;privacy protection;certificateless signcryption;consortium blockchaincertificateless signature scheme;secure;system
1933	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based Privacy Information Security Sharing Scheme in Industrial Internet of Things	Due to the competitive relationship among different smart factories, equipment manufacturers cannot integrate the private information of all smart factories to train the intelligent manufacturing equipment fault prediction model and improve the accuracy of intelligent manufacturing equipment fault detection. The use of a low fault recognition rate model for smart factories will cause additional losses for them. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based privacy information security sharing scheme in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to solve the sharing problem of private information in smart factories. Firstly, we abstract smart factories as edge nodes and build decentralized, distributed trusted blockchain networks based on Ethereum clients on simulated edge devices and propose an Intelligent Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (IECDSA) to guarantee the ownership of shared information by edge nodes. Secondly, we propose the Reputation-based Delegated Proof of Stake (RDPoS) consensus algorithm to improve the security and reliability of the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm. Furthermore, we design and implement an incentive mechanism based on information attributes to increase the motivation of edge nodes to share information. Finally, the proposed solution is simulated. Through theoretical and simulation experiments, it is proved that the blockchain-based privacy information security sharing scheme in IIoT can improve the enthusiasm of edge nodes to share information on the premise of ensuring the security of information sharing.	privacy information security sharing;industrial internet of things;blockchain;consensus algorithm;incentive mechanism
1934	市场治理	VW-DBG: A Dynamically Evolving Bitcoin Transaction Network Model	Exploring the evolution of the transaction network is very important for analyzing anonymous transaction behavior of encrypted currency and avoiding illegal crimes. However, with the rapid growth of cryptocurrency transactions in recent years, the traditional static analysis models tend to ignore parameter changes in the evolution process. To solve this problem, constructing time-varying network model is an effective scheme. The main challenge of turning the massive statically stored transaction data into dynamical sequential network is to design a set of suitable network model. This paper took Bitcoin system as example, combined complex network evolution theory, proposed a weighted variable directed bipartite graph (VW-DBG) model. Initially, we defined the transaction weights and the influence inditcator of nodes, and accordingly introduced the node deletion mechanism to Bitcoin transaction network analysis for the first time. Moreover, information entropy indicators was defined to screen key periods in the evolution. In addition, we analyzed the dynamic and static indicators of real Bitcoin transaction network under different observation time using this model, and revealed the pow-law distribution in evolutionary networks.	mathematical models;bitcoin;analytical models;numerical models;manganese;information entropy;bipartite graph;social networking;bitcoin;node deletion mechanism;bipartite graph
1935	市场治理	Stochastic Neural Networks-Based Algorithmic Trading for the Cryptocurrency Market	Throughout the history of modern finance, very few financial instruments have been as strikingly volatile as cryptocurrencies. The long-term prospects of cryptocurrencies remain uncertain; however, taking advantage of recent advances in neural networks and volatility, we show that the trading algorithms reinforced by short-term price predictions are bankable. Traditional trading algorithms and indicators are often based on mean reversal strategies that do not advantage price predictions. Furthermore, deterministic models cannot capture market volatility even after incorporating price predictions. Thus motivated by these issues, we integrate randomness in the price prediction models to simulate stochastic behavior. This paper proposes hybrid trading strategies that take advantage of the traditional mean reversal strategies alongside robust price predictions from stochastic neural networks. We trained stochastic neural networks to predict prices based on market data and social sentiment. The backtesting was conducted on three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, for over 600 days from August 2017 to December 2019. We show that the proposed trading algorithms are better when compared to the traditional buy and hold strategy in terms of both stability and returns.	bollinger bands;pairs trading;awesome oscillator;stochastic neural networks;cryptocurrency
1936	实体经济	Research on the Blue Carbon Trading Market System under Blockchain Technology	To combat global warming, "carbon neutrality" has gradually become a consensus. Some countries have constructed domestic and regional carbon trading markets, and links to global carbon markets are receiving increasing attention. Blue carbon, an important component of nature-based solutions (NbS), has not received the attention it deserves and is still isolated from the carbon trading market. Based on summarizing the existing achievements of blockchain application in carbon trading, this paper analyzes how to make each participating body provide services in the process of blue carbon production, circulation and trading, and designs the architectural diagram of the blue carbon system under peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions based on the theoretical framework of blockchain 3.0. Utilizing the advantages of decentralization, high transparency and non-tamperability of blockchain, we can realize a highly efficient, low-cost and intelligent blue carbon trading management system. Thus, we can make the world pay more attention to the development and utilization of marine resources and increase investment in blue carbon sink projects; and promote the development of blue carbon market, enrich the carbon trading market, and help achieve "emission reduction without reduction in production".	blockchain technology;blue carbon;carbon market;blue carbon trading;carbon neutralitysustainable development;climate-change;mechanism;coastal;sequestration;management;framework;policy;model;trust

Blockchain has a wide application prospect in data trading, but its concrete implementation faces many difficulties. This article proposes an obstacle analysis framework to understand the barriers of application of blockchain technology in power data trading, aiming to provide a decision-making guidance and management suggestions to relevant personnel. Firstly, an obstacle index system with 11 barriers is determined from three aspects of application, technology and legal policy. Secondly, a quantitative analysis model is constructed with (IT2TrFN), improved hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and interpretive structural modeling (ISM). And the K-means method is employed to optimize the discrimination of influence relations among indicators. Then, the model is applied in a case study to testify its applicability. The result shows that the difficulty in data maintenance is fundamental obstacle, the barriers of smart contract and supervision in transaction are important factors. Finally, a series of optimization measures and suggestions are put forward for different obstacles. (C) 2022 The Authors.

1938	技术治理	The shift of DarkNet illegal drug trade preferences in cryptocurrency: The question of traceability and deterrence	DarkNet markets (DNMs) are flourishing, exploiting cryptocurrencies' pseudo-anonymity feature. To fight the illegal drug trade, it is necessary to understand the factors influencing choices made by DNM consumers. ClearNet forums facilitate interactions among new and experienced DarkNet users, thus serving as an ideal source for investigation and research. The methodology of temporal topic models and sentiment analysis were applied to the ClearNet forum data to explore DNM new drug users' behavior over time. We inspected the development of major topics from the forum over eight years (2012e19) period to study the evolution in motivations and challenges faced by DNM users. The extracted temporal topic models successfully captured the apparent dynamics of critical events in the crypto world, showing the shift from Bitcoin to Monero. Our analysis demonstrates that the Bitcoin traceability announcement (made public in 2015) did not have a deterrent effect on the usage of Bitcoin, and this declaration instead acted as an advertisement for DNMs. Drug buyers used Bitcoin despite its traceability until Monero became untraceable in 2017 due to its privacy update.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

1939	实体经济	A blockchain-based lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme for internet of vehicles	The Internet of Vehicles is deployed in an open environment, and protecting its security and data privacy is the challenge. Carrying out the Internet of Vehicles secure authentication before interaction of information is an important part of ensuring the security foundation. Therefore, this article designs a safe and reliable Internet of Vehicles authentication and key agreement schemeassisted by blockchain. This article uses a multi-TA network model to improve the efficiency of authentication. Because of the rapid movement of vehicles, it will continue to appear cross-RSU and TA certification. Considering the disadvantages of most centralised authentication protocols using a single TA, this paper uses the multi-TA model to improve the efficiency of authentication. By usingblockchain technology to store the authentication information of vehicles, the cross-domain authentication of vehicles and the protection of user privacy information can be well realised. At the same time, in order to reduce the time of vehicle authentication, this scheme uses a lightweight calculation operation to complete the whole process of authentication. Through security analysis and results of Proverif simulation, the security of the solution is well proved, our scheme can resist various common attacks. Compared with some existing Internet of Vehicles security authentication protocols, the proposed scheme has a lower cost of computation, communication, and storage.	blockchain;internet of vehicle;mutual authentication;securitymanagement;protocol
1940	核心技术	A Novel Semifragile Consensus Algorithm Based on Credit Space for Consortium Blockchain	Nowadays, blockchain is known as a new generation of secure information technologies for realizing business and industrial sustainability, and consensus algorithm is the key technology of blockchain. In order to solve the problem of "oligarchy" nodes and excessive punishment for nodes in existing credit consensus algorithms, a novel semifragile consensus algorithm based on the credit space for consortium blockchain is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the accounting node selection mechanism based on credit space is proposed. The credit value of the node is calculated according to a novel credit evaluation model, and then the credit space of the node is allocated according to the size of the credit value. Afterward, a random algorithm is used to select the accounting node in the credit space. This mechanism effectively inhibits the generation of "oligarchy" nodes and maintains the enthusiasm of nodes. Secondly, this paper proposes a semifragile hierarchical punishment mechanism, which punishes the malicious nodes with severe measures and gives the nonmalicious nodes the opportunity to continue participating in the consensus. So, this semifragile punishment mechanism solves the problem of excessive punishment of nodes. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the proposed consensus algorithm has randomness while maintaining the credit incentive among nodes. In addition, the node's punishment mechanism is more reasonable. This algorithm has better security and can be well applied to consortium blockchain scenarios.	
1941	实体经济	Applying the blockchain-based deep reinforcement consensus algorithm to the intelligent manufacturing model under internet of things	Industry 4.0, namely intelligent manufacturing (IM), includes intelligent production (IP) and smart factory (SF). The study aims to improve the efficiency of the traditional business model, reduce the production cost, and transform the commercial manufacturing mode towards automation, intelligence, and timely on-demand distribution. Accordingly, a deep reinforcement consensus algorithm (DRCA) is established by adjusting the blockchain consensus algorithm (CA) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to IM applications. The results show that the proposed DRCA can process data more intensively, with faster calculation, higher accuracy, and robust security. Thus, it effectively improves the decentralization performance of the blockchain system. Compared with the traditional CAs, the proposed DRCA helps implement IM accurately and rapidly. Therefore, optimizing blockchain CA by DRL can effectively and accurately guide IM development and improve the efficiency of the manufacturing industry. The experimental data provide a reference for the relevant follow-up research.	blockchain consensus algorithm;deep reinforcement learning;intelligent manufacturing;business model

Increasingly complex construction projects have necessitated a corresponding evolvement of financial management tools and systems to augment security and control. A decentralised financial management system is introduced to deal with all financial tasks across various construction stages using blockchain technology.

1943	协同技术	A Blockchain-Based Authentication Solution for 6G Communication Security in Tactile Networks	In this era, the ultimate vision is to transform current technologies into intelligent global environments to facilitate everyday transactions. The emerging Industry 4.0 has introduced promising potential technologies that have expedited the transition of Internet of Things (IoT) into the Internet of Everything (IoE), utilizing the advances in artificial intelligence. Such a transition implies that sensitive data can be effortlessly accessed via the open network used by various domains such as military, business, transportation, medical, and education, leading to potential security concerns. Although a blockchain, along with the above fields, already employs a fast network such as 5G, the explosive growth in the development and implementation of various Industry 4.0-related domains requires significantly faster networking speeds and a secure mechanism for data transfer. This exhibits the need for 6G to meet the requirements of real-time applications, as shown in the graphical representation of the abstract. The bulk of this work was performed on a blockchain, but some methodology was needed that fulfilled security at different levels, such as the process level, data level, and infrastructure level. Our contribution in this work was twofold: first, at the process level, a novel smart contract mechanism was described; and second, at the data level, a digital signature methodology was employed that allowed anonymization to authenticate and secure the blockchain without encryption.	6g;blockchain;authentication;tactile networks;smart contract;industry 4.0challenges;requirements;vision
1944	实体经济	Evolutionary Game and Simulation Research of Blockchain-Based Co-Governance of Emergency Supply Allocation	Recently, with the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, emergency supply allocation system is drawing more and more social attention. Emergency supply allocation system is an important part of emergency governance system. It reflects social organizations' credibility, public safety, and the modernization level of social governance. However, emergency supply allocation system still has some problems, such as information asymmetry, different desires of participants, unreasonable allocation, and so on. At present, it is widely accepted that the advantage of blockchain in co-governance could be of great help in solving above problems. And in order to distinguish the effect of blockchain to the emergency supply allocation, the paper builds a tripartite evolutionary game model among the government, social organizations, and the public to analyse the impact of blockchain platform on emergency supply allocation. The simulation analysis shows the following: (1) The strategy choices of the government have a crucial impact on the evolution and stability of social organizations' strategies. It needs a long-term process to guide social organizations practicing active allocation, and the government should accelerate to build the blockchain platform to promote this process. (2) With the help of blockchain platform, the increment of penalty intensity of the government is conductive to increasing the probabilities that social organizations practice active allocation and the government practices strict supervision. (3) Blockchain platform has a significant impact on social organizations' choice for active allocation in many aspects, such as the positive and negative effects of social organizations, effect's increasing multiple, and the cost of the public informing. In the end, some suggestions are presented to improve the co-governance of emergency supply allocation.

The results report weak static return and volatility spillovers between NFTs and Defi assets and selected markets, showing that these new digital assets are still relatively decoupled from traditional asset classes. Bitcoin, oil, and half of the NFTs and Defi assets are net transmitters of return and volatility spillovers, whereas rest of the markets are net recipients of spillovers. Our findings show that the dynamic return and volatility connectedness become higher during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and the cryptocurrency bubble of 2021. We also compute the static and dynamic optimal weights, hedge ratios, and hedging effectiveness for the portfolios of NFTs/other asset and Defi asset/other asset and show that investors and portfolio managers should consider adding NFTs and Defi assets in their portfolios of gold, oil, and stock markets to achieve diversification benefits.	nfts;defi assets;alternative investments;diversification;covid-19;cryptocurrency bubbleimpulse-response analysis;safe-haven;volatility;bitcoin;gold;cryptocurrencies;spillovers;hedge;oil
1946	市场治理	General equilibrium cryptocurrency pricing in an OLG model	We study the valorization of cryptocurrency in an overlapping generations model where agents have the choice between crypto- and central bank currency. We pay attention to three features of cryptocurrency: it is a risky asset (because of frauds and hacks), which one acquires by bearing transaction costs, and its supply reaches its upper limit in a finite time (e.g., Bitcoin). We consider both the standard case with linear-quadratic utility functions and the more general case where utility functions are not specified. We find that the effect of an increase in cryptocurrency on the currency prices depends on the transaction costs that individuals bear to get cryptocurrency. In particular, when these costs are convex non-increasing in the quantity of cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency price may increase with this quantity. Otherwise, when the transaction costs are either increasing or concave non-increasing, the cryptocurrency price decreases with the quantity of cryptocurrency. We also show that the cryptocurrency and the central bank currency prices always move in opposite directions. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

1947	实体经济	A Systematic Review on Blockchain Adoption	Blockchain technologies have received considerable attention from academia and industry due to their distinctive characteristics, such as data integrity, security, decentralization, and reliability. However, their adoption rate is still scarce, which is one of the primary reasons behind conducting studies related to users' satisfaction and adoption. Determining what impacts the use and adoption of Blockchain technologies can efficiently address their adoption challenges. Hence, this systematic review aimed to review studies published on Blockchain technologies to offer a thorough understanding of what impacts their adoption and discuss the main challenges and opportunities across various sectors. From 902 studies collected, 30 empirical studies met the eligibility criteria and were thoroughly analyzed. The results confirmed that the technology acceptance model (TAM) and technology-organization-environment (TOE) were the most common models for studying Blockchain adoption. Apart from the core variables of these two models, the results indicated that trust, perceived cost, social influence, and facilitating conditions were the significant determinants influencing several Blockchain applications. The results also revealed that supply chain management is the main domain in which Blockchain applications were adopted. Further, the results indicated inadequate exposure to studying the actual use of Blockchain technologies and their continued use. It is also essential to report that existing studies have examined the adoption of Blockchain technologies from the lens of the organizational level, with little attention paid to the individual level. This review is believed to improve our understanding by revealing the full potential of Blockchain adoption and opening the door for further research opportunities.	blockchain;technology adoption theories;technology adoption models;systematic reviewknowledge management processes;technology adoption;supply chain;health-care;circular economy;built environment;waste management;acceptance;challenges;information

Drawing on primary documents and participant observation, this article traces how the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) anticipates automation emanating from the growing integration of blockchain technologies in global governance. We find that promises of radical, rapid, and reckless automation advanced by promoters of Bitcoin and other 'defiant' applications of the technology are steered by this IO towards more incremental and carefully managed forms of automation. The OECD relies on two managerialist practices to anticipate "reckless automation" through the promotion of what we identify as "responsible disruption". In combination, OECD practices of scenario building and shared orientation framework construction deepen and extend managerial forms of global governance today whose technocratic and expert-led nature limits democratic possibilities and perpetuates global inequalities.	automation;blockchain;governance;inequality;international organisations;managerialism;organisation for economic co-operation and development;technologyblockchain technology;governance

In practice, it is implemented through prior negotiated service level agreements (SLAs) between the parties involved. However, it is recognized that these agreements are difficult to negotiate, monitor, and enforce. for future 6G networks, resource and infrastructure sharing is expected to play an even greater role. It will be a crucial technique for reducing overall infrastructure costs and increasing operational efficiencies for operators. More efficient SLA mechanisms are thus crucial to the success of future networks. In this work, we present BEAT, an automated, transparent, and accountable end-to-end architecture for network sharing based on blockchain and smart contracts. This work focuses on a particular type of blockchain, permissioned distributed ledger, due to its permissioned nature allowing for industry-compliant SLAs with stringent governance.

However, there are concerns about whether blockchain can provide sufficient security, transparency and cost reduction needed for land registry transactions. For developed and developing economies, it is crucial to register immovable properties in land registry and to appropriately reflect on rights related to them. Thus, several states have been devoting significant resources to land registry studies in the past. Turkey is among these states. Further, significant progress has been made in land registry efforts that have been ongoing since the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, especially in recent years. Additionally, extensive studies have been conducted to transfer the land registry system to the electronic environment. However, the increasing prevalence of blockchain technology in the world will also affect Turkey. First, the situation in certain countries that use or are considering blockchain-based registries is explained in this study. Further, the compatibility of the blockchain-based land registry and the principles that govern the Turkish land registry system are discussed. Finally, a brief review of the blockchain-based model developed for the Turkish land registry is made.	blockchain;land register;security;comparative law;turkish law
1951	虚拟经济	NFT, copyright and intellectual property commercialization	The invention of disruptive technologies broadens the horizon of opportunities for intellectual property owners. The very idea of selling copyright works in a digital space and using the same to form a digital currency is disruptive. This is one opportunity Non-Fungible Token (NFT) offers. But that disruptiveness raises certain questions and provoke the consciousness to wonder if NFTs are a form of intellectual property, or whether NFT would shift the paradigm of copyright law as we know it. Governments through her agencies are also caught in the unrestlessness of deciphering what NFT means and whether it holds any value for intellectual property. This article will address the relationship between NFT and copyright, the forseeable problems and solutions, and how NFTs are channels for intellectual property commercialisation.	non-fungible token;nft and copyright;nft and intellectual property;copyright commercialization;ifeanyi emmanuel okonkwo

1957	实体经济	A Blockchain Framework to Secure Personal Health Record (PHR) in IBM Cloud-Based Data Lake	The health system in today's real world is significant but difficult and overcrowded. These hurdles can be diminished using improved health record management and blockchain technology. These technologies can handle medical data to provide security by monitoring and maintaining patient records. The processing of medical data and patient records is essential to analyze the earlier prescribed medicines and to understand the severity of diseases. Blockchain technology can improve the security, performance, and transparency of sharing the medical records of the current healthcare system. This paper proposed a novel framework for personal health record (PHR) management using IBM cloud data lake and blockchain platform for an effective healthcare management process. The problem in the blockchain-based healthcare management system can be minimized with the utilization of the proposed technique. Significantly, the traditional blockchain system usually decreases the latency. Therefore, the proposed technique focuses on improving latency and throughput. The result of the proposed system is calculated based on various matrices, such as F1 Score, Recall, and Confusion matrices. Therefore, the proposed work scored high accuracy and provided better results than existing techniques.	integrity management;care;technology;challenges;platform;model

The emergence of IoT has also emphasized the need to cater to challenges such as interoperability, smart IoT components adoption, authentication and authorization, networking, information retrieval, and several other issues. The ubiquitous nature and interconnection between various devices supported by machine learning, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, big data, and blockchain lead to a generation of large amounts of data. In order to find useful information from such data is a tedious task and involves high computation. The domain of Information Retrieval helps us to identify and manage environmental factors of data collected through sensors. The data gathered may be heterogeneous and from different sources. This demands the need for better retrieval efficiency, accuracy, and systematic models for gathering and managing the sensed data. Designing such a model with security and privacy is a major concern. The acquired knowledge from those models will be helpful for data analytics, performance-boosting, decision making, and managing the resources efficiently. A detailed study of the importance of Information Retrieval and Data Analytics in the Internet of Things is presented in this paper.	internet of things;data analytics;information retrieval;big data;data mining;smart city;machine learningbig data;system;iot

1960	市场治理	An automated cryptocurrency trading system based on the detection of unusual price movements with a Time-Series Clustering-Based approach	The cryptocurrency market, which has a rapidly growing market size, attracts the increasing attention of indi-vidual and institutional investors. While this highly volatile market offers great profit opportunities to investors, it also brings risks due to its sensitivity to speculative news and the unpredictable behaviour of major investors that can cause unsual price movements. In this paper, we argue that rapid and high price fluctuations or unusual patterns that occur in this way may negatively affect the functionality of technical signals that constitute a basis for feature extraction in a machine learning (ML)-based trading system and this may cause the generalization of the model to deteriorate. To address this problem, we propose an end-to-end ML-based trading system including a time series outlier detection module that detects the periods in which unusual price formations are observed. The training of the classification algorithms for the price direction prediction task was performed on the remaining data. We present the results related to the accuracy of the classification models as well as the simulation results obtained using the proposed system for real time trading on the historical data. The findings showed that the outlier detection step significantly increases return on investment for the machine learning-based trading strategies. Besides, the results showed that during the highly volatile periods the trading system becomes more profitable compared to the baseline model and buy&hold strategy.	price prediction;dynamic time warping;hierarchical clustering;anomaly detection;outlier detection;machine learning
1961	市场治理	Accountable Monero System with Privacy Protection	Monero is one of the prominent cryptocurrencies bringing robust privacy safeguard levels. However, for Monero lacking accountability, it is easy to use anonymity and privacy for committing the crime without the leakage of identity. And some exchanges are not very receptive to Monero. The purpose of this study is to balance privacy and accountability in Monero. Specifically, we studied the way to provide accountability while keeping privacy. We develop an accountable Monero model. Our model isolates three kinds of roles, users, the trusted registration authority, and a trusted regulator. Accountability enables the trusted regulator to reveal the signer's identity. Only the trusted regulator can trace users' public keys as needed. We give a construction for the accountable Monero system by combining CryptoNote protocol with ElGamal encryption. Our instantiation is with a marginal influence on efficiency. The security of our scheme is based on the discrete logarithm and decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption.	
1962	市场治理	Fintech, Cryptocurrencies, and CBDC: Financial Structural Transformation in China	Fintech and decentralized finance have penetrated all areas of the financial system and have improved financial inclusion in the last decade. In this paper, we review the recent literature on fintech, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). There are important implications from the rise of fintech and the introduction of stablecoins and CBDC in recent years. We provide an overview of China's experience in fintech, focusing on payments, digital banking, fintech lending, and the recent progress on its CBDC pilots (e-CNY). We also discuss important considerations in designing effective cryptocurrency regulations. Cryptocurrency regulations could promote growth of innovations through enhanced public confidence in this market. The e-CNY could become mainstream in the global market through effective regulations which provide incentives and protection to market participants. A key factor to success for digital currencies has been their widespread adoption. If the Chinese e-CNY were to become a mainstream currency, the introduction of CBDC could potentially offer solutions to existing problems inherent in the traditional financial systems.

1963	市场治理	Cryptocurrency price discrepancies under uncertainty: Evidence from COVID-19 and lockdown nexus	The past decades have witnessed recurrent price discrepancies in cryptocurrency markets across countries. In addition to prior explanations that generally attribute this phenomenon to domestic capital controls during normal periods, we provide another explanation that investors perceive cryptocurrency as an alternative (hedging) investment, especially under uncertainty. Using the emerging of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and the subsequent lockdown policies implemented by a group of countries as natural experiments, we adopt a difference-in-difference framework to examine how the nexus affects Bitcoin price discrepancies. We find that price discrepancies are larger in countries with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and rigorously implementing lockdown policies. We then verify our "alternative investment" hypothesis on the mechanism by showing that countries with intensified exposure to media hype on COVID-19 topics and with more panic emotion among citizens during the pandemic generally experienced larger Bitcoin price discrepancies than their counterparts. We also find that domestic capital control, sanitary policy stringency, uncertainty aversion, individualistic culture, and governmental power could moderate the general effect.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

1964	协同技术	Blockchain Empowered Federated Learning for Distributed Network Security Behaviour Knowledge Base in 6G	The malicious flow originating from massive access devices in 6G network will increase sharply. In order to effectively reduce malicious flow, we hope to establish a new framework for coordination of security monitoring and malicious behaviour control in 6G network. Federated learning provides data and privacy protection for the distributed network security behaviour knowledge base. However, since the equipment of its participants needs to upload the original data to the central server for model training, this may lead to data leakage in the knowledge base. Therefore, in this article, we first use the knowledge graph to describe network security behaviours, then build a universal network security malicious behaviour knowledge base, and discuss its application scenarios. Then, we propose a blockchain empowered federated learning (BeFL) for distributed network security malicious behaviour knowledge base architecture to ensure the security of knowledge transmission. Finally, we deployed the designed distributed knowledge base in the prototype system and compared it with the other two baseline methods to verify the performance. Relevant results show that our method outperforms other methods in terms of user identification, flow detection, and attack source tracing.	privacy;intelligent
1965	实体经济	Accident responsibility identification model for Internet of Vehicles based on lightweight blockchain	The rapid development of autonomous vehicle technology has brought a new experience to people's daily travel. However, if a traffic accident involving autonomous vehicles occurs, it will face difficulties in vehicle accident forensic-preservation, leakage of vehicle owner's privacy, and identifying legal liabilities. This article proposes an accident responsibility identification model for the Internet of Vehicles based on lightweight blockchain to solve the above problems. This model uses Car Forensics Master to collect evidence from the accident vehicle, and at the same time collects evidence from maintenance service providers, automobile manufacturers, transportation management departments, insurance companies, and other vehicle accident related parties and stores them in the preservation chain. We also use VPKI to protect the autonomous vehicle identity privacy. In order to improve the efficiency of the model and set up authorized access to related entities, the identification of accident liability is jointly completed by the preservation chain and the accident identification chain. In addition, we prove that the protocol proposed in the model has ideal security properties. Finally, we implement the smart contracts in the model through the Solidity language, and evaluate its performance.	blockchain;cross-chain interaction;internet of vehicles;privacy protection;smart contractsframework;system
1966	实体经济	Confidentiality-minded framework for blockchain-based BIM design collaboration	Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted for design collaboration in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, while its centralized paradigm suffers the risk of data manipulation. To this end, blockchain is an emerging distributive technology that guarantees data authenticity and integrity by providing decentralized, immutable, and traceable data storage. However, directly integrating BIM with blockchain risks leaking sensitive data, since a blockchain is a transparent network insofar as shared information (including sensitive data) can be disclosed to all members without access control. Therefore, this paper proposes a confidentiality-minded framework (CMF) for blockchain-based design collaboration. The major innovations are twofold. First, an access control model is developed in the CMF to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive BIM data in a blockchain ledger. Second, new design strategies are developed in CMF to facilitate design coordination within the access-controlled blockchain network. An illustrative design example validates the feasibility and performance of the proposed CMF, which has acceptable latency and storage cost. The results also show that the sensitive BIM data are effectively kept confidential when project members collaborate within the CMF.	bim;blockchain;design collaboration;smart contract;asymmetric encryption;bim merkel treebuilt environment;technology;management;platform
1967	实体经济	Blockchain, climate damage, and death: Policy interventions to reduce the carbon emissions, mortality, and net-zero implications of non-fungible tokens and Bitcoin	The art industry has commercialised and popularised non-fungible tokens (NFTs), with the volume and value of NFT transactions rapidly growing to US$ 10.7 billion in Q3 2021. The increase in NFT transactions has drawn the attention of the art market to the consequent carbon emissions resulting from verifying transactions in proof-ofwork blockchains supporting NFT transactions. With CO2-related deaths attributable to NFT transactions, social pressure from the art market has helped to progress the switch away from the deliberately polluting proof-ofwork blockchains to more sustainable consensus protocols.Nonetheless, many popular types of blockchain have resisted the pressure to decrease their environmental impact, including Bitcoin, whose attributed 2021 annual emissions will produce emissions responsible for around 19,000 future deaths. In response, recent global policy interventions have employed legal and fiscal tools to reduce the carbon impact of some or all types of blockchains. Linking the damage caused by proof-of-work blockchains to climate change and human mortality, this study examines the recent policy interventions designed to motivate a shift in blockchain consensus protocols and promote miners' energy efficiency to mitigate environmental damage. This article further explores available policy intervention options that are currently not utilised.	non-fungible token;nfts;carbon emissions;blockchain energy consumption;bitcoin;ethereum;sustainable development goals
1968	实体经济	Method and System for Detecting and Recognizing Floating Garbage Moving Targets on Water Surface with Big Data Based on Blockchain Technology	At present, the methods for cleaning up floating objects in small water areas such as campus artificial lakes and community sightseeing artificial lakes are mainly to use traditional tools such as hand-held nets to remove them. There are disadvantages such as unclean cleaning, long time-consuming, low efficiency, and high labor intensity. The habit and tradition of allowing the ocean to accept human waste have made almost all sea areas on the planet now full of garbage, from the poles to the equator, from coastal bays to submarine riverbeds. The accumulation of marine litter, especially plastic litter, is considered to be an urgent global environmental problem along with many important issues of our time. In this paper, three typical working environments with good vision, more reflections in the water, and strong light interference are performed to identify floating objects. Each working environment has 100 images to be tested, a total of 300 images, and read the next image after processing one image. The detection rates under the three working environments were 93%, 96%, and 74%, and the average detection rate was 84.3%.	
1969	核心技术	Stability Analysis and Control of Decision-Making of Miners in Blockchain	To maintain blockchain-based services with ensuring its security, it is an important issue how to decide a mining reward so that the number of miners participating in the mining increases. We propose a dynamical model of decision-making for miners using an evolutionary game approach and analyze the stability of equilibrium points of the proposed model. The proposed model is described by the 1st-order differential equation. So, it is simple but its theoretical analysis gives an insight into the characteristics of the decision-making. Through the analysis of the equilibrium points, we show the transcritical bifurcations and hysteresis phenomena of the equilibrium points. We also design a controller that determines the mining reward based on the number of participating miners to stabilize the state where all miners participate in the mining. Numerical simulation shows that there is a trade-off in the choice of the design parameters.	blockchain;proof-of-work;decision-making;evolutionary game;bifurcation;hysteresis;feedback controlreplicator dynamics;subsidy;game
1970	实体经济	Cross-Border Supply Chain System Constructed by Complex Computer Blockchain for International Cooperation	The rapid development of China's local e-commerce and the continuous improvement of its business model have not only pushed the country to the forefront of the globe but also opened up the unprecedented potential for China's cross-border e-commerce. Therefore, it is imperative to build a balanced and sustainable cross-border e-commerce system, and cross-border e-commerce on the Silk Road has become a new highlight of China's e-commerce development. This study proposes a cross-border supply chain model based on the complex computer blockchain for international cooperation scenarios, contrasts and analyzes decision making in two cross-border supply chain scenarios with and without blockchain implementation, and investigates the sufficient conditions for blockchain implementation in the cross-border supply chain from the perspective of various value objectives. The analysis reveals that the cross-border supply chain has sufficient incentive to implement blockchain when the value gain generated by implementing blockchain is high or the value gain is low but the potential market size weakening factor of cross-border products is greater than a certain degree. It demonstrates that the link between cross-border product price elasticity, manufacturer cross-border effort cost, and customer cross-border preference degree would impact the circumstances for adopting blockchain in cross-border supply chains. The model also lays out a plan for the government to improve cross-border e-commerce logistics, strengthen oversight, and create a regional financial service network system to reduce credit risk.4	
1971	核心技术	An Edge Cloud Data Integrity Protection Scheme Based on Blockchain	The publicly accessible feature of edge servers leads to the threat of malicious access to the data stored on the server and a series of security problems such as the leakage of user data privacy and the destruction of integrity. Data custody causes the separation of user ownership and management rights and brings potential security risks of data theft and destruction. Among them, for the integrity of the data uploaded by the terminal, the current protection mechanism mostly verifies the identity of the visitor or encrypts the data, but the role of verification is mostly assumed by the server, and it is impossible to avoid the collusion of edge servers with malicious intruders. In this paper, a distributed virtual machine agent (VMA) is designed and implemented, an edge cloud data integrity monitoring framework is built, and the verification protocol based on blockchain is proposed, which achieves trusted verification without relying on a trusted third party. Also, a prototype system of edge cloud data integrity protection based on blockchain is constructed to prevent data corruption. The results of security proof and experimental verification show that the mechanism based on blockchain technology can defend against three attacks of cloud service providers, has superior computation, and reduces the storage costs to protect the integrity of user data.	cost
1972	虚拟经济	Decentralized blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy-backed token trading for active prosumers	This paper designs and models a fully decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) energy token market for smallscale prosumers using blockchain technology in a smart grid environment in the presence of the demand response (DR) program and demurrage mechanism. As the market players, prosumers in the local distribution network are considered in two groups, producers (sellers) and consumers (buyers). Using smart contracts, all sellers and buyers in the proposed market can engage in bilateral energy token transactions (P2P) with each other under an agreed price and with the retail market at a certain price. Furthermore, the local consumers can participate in price-based DR programs and shift their consuming load to the periods with high local generation. Demurrage mechanism is applied to avoid energy token accumulation and enhance attraction for local transactions. With demurrage in place, the redemption value of energy-backed tokens reduces with time. A fully decentralized approach called the primal-dual sub gradient method is developed to clear this fully decentralized energy market in the presence of DR programs and demurrage. The proposed market-clearing scheme guarantees the global and feasible solution without requiring the players' private information. Numerical studies demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed energy token market and the decentralized approach for its clearing.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

1973	核心技术	OptSmart: a space efficient Optimistic concurrent execution of Smart contracts	Popular blockchains such as Ethereum and several others execute complex transactions in the block through user-defined scripts known as smart contracts. Serial execution of smart contract transactions/atomic units (AUs) fails to harness the multiprocessing power offered by the prevalence of multi-core processors. By adding concurrency to the execution of AUs, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. In this paper, we develop a concurrent miner that proposes a block by executing AUs concurrently using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs). It efficiently captures independent AUs in the concurrent bin and dependent AUs in the block graph (BG). Later, we propose a concurrent validator that re-executes the same AUs concurrently and deterministically using the concurrent bin followed by the BG given by the miner to verify the block. We rigorously prove the correctness of concurrent execution of AUs. The performance benchmark shows that the average speedup for the optimized concurrent miner is 5.21x, while the maximum is 14.96x over the serial miner. The optimized validator obtains an average speedup of 8.61x to a maximum of 14.65x over the serial validator. The proposed miner outperforms 1.02x to 1.18x, while the proposed validator outperforms 1x to 4.46x over state-of-the-art concurrent miners and validators, respectively. Moreover, the proposed efficient BG saves an average of 2.29x more block space when compared with the state-of-the-art.	blockchain;smart contracts;software transactional memory system;multi-version;concurrency control;opacity
1974	协同技术	empty	Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET) is a version of Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET). Owing to an increase in road accidents, VANET offers safety to road vehicles through appropriate coordination with vehicles and road side units. Along with the security guidelines of the vehicles in the network, privacy and security become vital parameters that need to be accomplished for secure data transmission in VANET. This study develops an efficient privacy-preserving data transmission architecture using red deer optimization algorithm based clustering with blockchain technology (RDOAC-BT) in cluster-based VANET. The proposed RDOAC-BT technique involves the design of RDOA based clustering technique to elect cluster heads (CHs) and construct clusters. In addition, blockchain technology is employed for secured transmission in VANET. Moreover, the blockchain is utilized to perform intra-cluster and inter-cluster communication processes. A wide range of simulations take place and the results are examined under varying aspects.

1975	实体经济	PHDMF: A Flexible and Scalable Personal Health Data Management Framework Based on Blockchain Technology	Currently, most of the personal health data (PHD) are managed and stored separately by individual medical institutions. When these data need to be shared, they must be transferred to a trusted management center and approved by data owners through the third-party endorsement technology. Therefore, it is difficult for personal health data to be shared and circulated over multiple medical institutions. On the other hand, the use of directly exchanging and sharing the original data has become inconsistent with the data rapid growth of medical institutions because of the need of massive data transferring across agencies. In order to secure sharing and managing the mass personal health data generated by various medical institutions, a federal personal health data management framework (PHDMF, ) has been developed, which had the following advantages: 1) the blockchain technology was used to establish a data consortium over multiple medical institutions, which could provide a flexible and scalable technical solution for member extension and solve the problem of third-party endorsement during data sharing; 2) using data distributed storage technology, personal health data could be majorly stored in their original medical institutions, and the massive data transferring process was of no further use, which could match up with the data rapid growth of these institutions; 3) the distributed ledger technology was utilized to record the hash value of data, given the anti-tampering feature of the technology, malicious modification of data could be identified by comparing the hash value; 4) the smart contract technology was introduced to manage users' access and operation of data, which made the data transaction process traceable and solved the problem of data provenance; and 5) a trusted computing environment was provided for meta-analysis with statistic information instead of original data, the trusted computing environment could be further applied to more health data, such as genome sequencing data, protein expression data, and metabolic profile data through combining the federated learning and blockchain technology. In summary, the framework provides a convenient, secure, and trusted environment for health data supervision and circulation, which facilitate the consortium establish over medical institutions and help achieve the value of data sharing and mining.	personal health data;blockchain;smart contract;data provenance;data sharingsupply chain;system

Internet of things (IoT) is regarded as one of the most trending technologies with a great potential in fighting against the coronavirus outbreak. In this study, we examine the current status of IoT applications related to COVID-19, identify their deployment and operational challenges, and suggest possible opportunities to further contain the pandemic. Furthermore, we perform analysis by examining the IoT implementation in which internal and external factors are discussed.

1977	市场治理	The digital asset value and currency supervision under deep learning and blockchain technology	With the rapid development of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, it is difficult to extract the effective information from massive data and quantify the value of digital assets using current methods. As a key underlying technology, blockchain technology can no longer meet most of the needs of digital currency transactions. Based on this, the digital asset is taken as the research object and an analysis model for digital asset value is established with the deep learning technology in this study. Then, the authorization mechanism in the distributed position and orientation system (DPOS) algorithm is extracted and applied to the precise backward error tracking (PBET) algorithm based on the existing consensus algorithm in blockchain technology. Thus, a dynamic delegated practical byzantine fault tolerance (DDPBFT) algorithm that can be applied to the blockchain is proposed. Finally, a supervisable digital currency system is constructed based on the improved blockchain technology. After specific analysis, it is found that the analysis model for digital asset value based on the deep learning proposed in this study shows good stability and accuracy, and can help enterprises to analyze the value of digital assets. Compared with the existing consensus mechanism algorithms, the proposed DDPBFT algorithm shows better results in terms of throughput and delay. Finally, the supervisable digital currency model based on the improved blockchain technology can unite the public chains, alliance chains, and user wallets, and realize the traceability of transaction information. In short, the quantitative analysis of the value of digital assets has been realized and the supervision of digital currency transactions has been achieved by using the improved blockchain technology.

1978	虚拟经济	Which cryptocurrency data sources should scholars use?	Inspired by Alexander and Dakos (2020), we shed more light on the adequacy of data in the cryptocurrency literature by analysing the scaling properties and underlying processes of the main cryptocurrency databases (Coinmarketcap, Coingecko, BraveNewCoin and Cryptocompare) and exchange platforms (Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Cexio and Exmo). Our results show that coin-ranking sites, such as Coinmarketcap, Coingecko and BraveNewCoin (i) include most of the cryptocurrency trading activity and (ii) are essentially characterised by the same underlying processes as the main exchange platforms (Coinbase and Bitstamp) and alternative coin-ranking sites (Cryptocompare), regardless of the possible issues arising from the aggregation of different exchanges to compute a unique cryptocurrency price. Therefore, we state that these databases are appropriate to conduct research. At any rate, we observe that all the databases analysed in this paper show the same underlying process for most liquid cryptocurrencies; consequently, scholars could use any of them for their studies, as long as they consider the different trading activity included by each database. This result is supported by an empirical analysis focused on weak-form market efficiency, since we report the same degree of efficiency regardless of the database and exchange platform. Nevertheless, we recognise the need for further research, given the gap in the literature and the black-box method used by coin-ranking sites to compute a unique cryptocurrency price.	bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;data;scaling behaviour;efficiencymarket-efficiency;prices;inefficiency;agents;tests

This study compares the dynamic spillover effects of gold and Bitcoin prices on the oil and stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic via time-varying parameter vector autoregression. Both time-varying and time-point results indicate that gold is a safe haven for oil and stock markets during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, unlike gold, Bitcoin's response is the opposite, rejecting the safe haven property. Further analysis shows that the safe-haven effects of gold on the stock market become stronger when the pandemic critically spreads.	gold;bitcoin;safe haven;covid-19;tvp-var model;impulse responsehedging effectiveness;dynamic correlations;nonlinear causality;stock markets;oil price;time;volatility;uncertainty;investment;search
1980	市场治理	Risk transmissions between bitcoin and traditional financial assets during the COVID-19 era: The role of global uncertainties	This paper examines return and volatility connectedness between Bitcoin, traditional financial assets (Crude Oil, Gold, Stocks, Bonds, and the United States Dollar-USD), and major global uncertainty measures (the Economic Policy Uncertainty-EPU, the Twitter-based Economic Uncertainty-TEU, and the Volatility Index-VIX) from April 29, 2013, to June 30, 2020. To this end, the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) model, dynamic connectedness approaches, and network analyses are used. The results indicate that total spillover indices reached unprecedented levels during COVID-19 and have remained high since then. The evidence also confirms the high return and volatility spillovers across markets during the COVID-19 era. Regarding the return spillovers, Gold is the centre of the system and demonstrates the safe heaven properties. Bitcoin is a net transmitter of volatility spillovers to other markets, particularly during the COVID-19 period. Furthermore, the causality-in-variance Lagrange Multiplier (LM) and the Fourier LM tests' results confirm a unidirectional volatility transmission from Bitcoin to Gold, Stocks, Bonds, the VIX and Crude Oil. Interestingly the EPU is the only global factor that causes higher volatility in Bitcoin. Several potential implications of the results are also discussed.	return connectedness;risk transmissions;bitcoin;financial assets;global uncertainty measuressafe haven;dynamic connectedness;volatility;cryptocurrency;hedge;returns;time;gold

Based on the unique features of cryptocurrencies, we build a model with anonymous traders valuing cryptocurrencies as payments for goods and investment assets, and find that decreases in funding liquidity translate into lower asset liquidity in the cryptocurrency market. Empirically, we observe that many widely recognized stock market anomalies also exist in the cryptocurrency market, although some have opposite long and short legs. We also find evidence that a decrease in cryptocurrency liquidity enhances anomalous returns while preventing the cryptocurrency market from achieving efficiency.	cryptocurrency;asset liquidity;funding liquidity;anomaliescross-section;bitcoin;efficiency;returns;policy;costs;risk

Benefits and solutions are identified for the smooth conduction of agricultural supply chains during COVID-19 using blockchain. This study uses interviews with agricultural companies operating in Pakistan. The findings discover the seven most commonly shared benefits of applying blockchain technology, four major challenges, and promising solutions. About 100% of the respondents mentioned blockchain as a solution for tracking the shipment during COVID-19, data retrieval and data management, product and transaction frauds, and an Inflexible international supply chain. Roughly 75% of the respondents mentioned the challenge of lack of data retrieval and data management and the Inflexible international supply chain in COVID-19 besides their solutions. This study can expand existing knowledge related to agricultural supply chains.

The use of classical and modern encryption technique are very common and are becoming prone to attacks by crypto-analytics. Due to the technological advancement, new ideas of data security comes very rapidly. For this reason the use of blockchain has become profound but the actual security of the data encryption technique always depends on the choice of the key. Stronger key leads to high data security. The paper aims to explore the concept of DNA encoding to propose a data encryption algorithm. It uses a dynamic DNA encoded table which contains different combination of four DNA bases A, C, G, and T but the main feature of dynamic DNA sequence table is its randomness which is changed for different characters in ASCII code in each run time. This randomness in the encryption disables attackers to perform any sort of statistical analysis to decipher the encrypted text or guess the key.	security;availability;key generation;random dna sequence;encryptionimage encryption;cryptography;cryptosystem
1984	核心技术	Self-Sovereign Identity Solution for Blockchain-Based Land Registry System: A Comparison	Providing an identity solution is essential for a reliable blockchain-based land registry system. A secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient identity solution is essential but challenging. This paper examines the current literature and provides a systematic literature review in three stages based on the three research questions (RQ) that show the assessment and interpretation process step by step. Based on the parameters and RQ specified in the research methodology section, a total of 43 primary articles have been selected from the 251 articles extracted from various scientific databases. The majority of these articles are concerned with evaluating the existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) solutions and their role in the blockchain-based land registry system to address the compliance issues in the existing SSI solutions with SSI principles and find the best possible SSI solution to address the identity problems in the land registry. The existing digital identity solutions cannot handle the requirements of the identity principle and are prone to various limitations like centralization and dependency on third parties that further augment the chance of security threats. SSI has been designed to overcome these limitations and provide a secure, reliable, and efficient identity solution that gives complete control to the users over their personal identity information (PII). This paper reviews the existing SSI solutions, evaluates them based on the SSI principles, and comes up with the best possible SSI solution for a blockchain-based land registry system. It further provides a detailed investigation of each SSI solution to present its functionalities and limitations for further improvement.	management
1985	实体经济	Research on carbon emission reduction and blockchain investment under different dual-channel supply chains	Based on the consideration that consumers have low-carbon sensitivity and channel preference, a Stackelberg game model dominated by the manufacturer was constructed to study the joint strategies of low-carbon emission reduction and blockchain investment of supply chain members under three models: traditional retailer dual channel, manufacturer's online direct sales dual channel, and third-party e-commerce distribution dual channel. The interaction of different levels of emission reduction and blockchain investment in different dual-channel models was verified through the calculation and simulation analysis of the optimal decision of the supply chain members. The research results showed that the optimal emission reduction of manufacturers and the blockchain investment level of retailers under different dual-channel models are distinguishing, and manufacturers have the highest emission reduction under the dual-channel model of direct online sales; when manufacturers invest the same amount of emission reduction, the traditional retailer dual-channel model can obtain the highest profit. In the process of emission reduction decision-making, there are technology investors and beneficiaries, and the investment level is affected by the dual benefit effect of low-carbon emission reduction and trust and the combined effect of cost input. And the profit of the dual channel of third-party e-commerce distribution is the lowest; the ratio of technology gain to cost investment in the supply chain determines the initiative of low-carbon investment. Meanwhile, there are specific blockchain investment thresholds in different dual-channel modes, and the increase of the threshold value will improve the emission reduction. Besides, emission reduction investment is driven by the manufacturer's profit, and the more the manufacturer's channel accounts for, the higher the emission reduction tends to be. And further from the perspective of profit and emission reduction, it provides a reference for the channel selection and joint emission reduction strategies of the supply chain.	carbon emission reduction;blockchain;stackelberg game;dual channel;supply chain decision-makinggame-theoretic analysis;decisions;strategy;design;model
1986	核心技术	An Incentive Mechanism for Sustainable Blockchain Storage	Miners in a blockchain system are suffering from ever-increasing storage costs, which in general have not been properly compensated by the users' transaction fees. This reduces the incentives for the miners' participation and may jeopardize the blockchain security. To mitigate this blockchain insufficient fee issue, we propose a Fee and Waiting Tax (FWT) mechanism, which explicitly considers the two types of negative externalities in the system. Specifically, we model the interactions between the protocol designer, users, and miners as a three-stage Stackelberg game. By characterizing the equilibrium of the game, we find that miners neglecting the negative externality in transaction selection cause they are willing to accept insufficient-fee transactions. This leads to the insufficient storage fee issue in the existing protocol (i.e., deployed in Bitcoin and Ethereum). Moreover, our proposed optimal FWT mechanism can motivate users to pay sufficient transaction fees to cover the storage costs and achieve the unconstrained social optimum. Numerical results show that the optimal FWT mechanism guarantees sufficient transaction fees and achieves an average social welfare improvement of 51.43% or more over the existing protocol. Furthermore, the optimal FWT mechanism reduces the average waiting time of low-fee transactions and all transactions by 68.49% and 61.56%, respectively.	blockchains;costs;protocols;games;finance;robots;ieee transactions;blockchain storage;game theory;incentive mechanism

1988	市场治理	Linkages between DeFi assets and conventional currencies: Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic	This paper examines the static and dynamic returns connectedness between four renowned DeFi assets, namely, Chainlink, Maker, Basic Attention Token, and Synthetix, and four internationally important conventional currencies, being they Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Euro, and Pound Sterling. We use the time-varying parameter vector autoregressions framework combined with the connectedness approach based on the generalized forecast error variance decomposition. Our static connectedness analysis evidences a low connection of the DeFi markets with the conventional currency markets. The results of our dynamic analysis reveal that the return spillovers are time-varying, with an abrupt increase in connectedness between the DeFi and currency markets in early 2020, during the initial escalation of the pandemic. However, the spillover from the Chinese Yuan to the system does not exhibit any hike due to the COVID-19-triggered meltdown, highlighting a pandemic-caused decoupling of the Chinese financial system from the other centralized and decentralized markets. We observe unprecedentedly high spillovers from the system to the DeFi markets at the beginning of the pandemic. However, we still find that the DeFi markets act predominantly as net innovation transmitters during the first COVID-19 year. Moreover, we detect the existence of a pairwise-like relationship between the net return spillover profiles and report on inversely symmetric profiles for the Maker - Euro, Basic Attention Token - Japanese Yen, and the Chainlink - Pound Sterling pairs. Given the time-varying transmission-reception patterns for all markets, investors and policymakers can make use of our spillover analysis to improve portfolio allocation and regulatory decisions.	defi;currencies;spillover;covid-19impulse-response analysis;decentralized finance;volatility;transmission;blockchain
1989	法律治理	REGULATING DIGITAL CURRENCIES: TOWARDS AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK	Digital currencies have the potential to improve the speed and efficiency of payments and to broaden financial inclusion. The principal goal is to facilitate payments among consumers on a day-to-day basis as an alternative to cash, both domestically and across national borders. This Article begins by critically examining and critiquing the ongoing progress of trying to develop retail digital currencies, focusing on the two most feasible approaches: central bank digital currencies ("CBDC"), and privately issued currencies that are backed by assets having intrinsic value ("stablecoins"). The Article then analyzes how these digital currencies should be regulated and supervised, exploring their similarities and differences. Both CBDC and stablecoins raise innovative legal issues as well as the types of legal issues normally associated with money and payment systems, although in novel contexts. If widely used, stablecoins could also impair central banks' abilities to control monetary policy and possibly undermine confidence in the value or operational continuity of currencies, which could threaten international monetary and financial stability. Stablecoin regulation must also address those potential threats.

This paper draws on an ethnography of crypto trading to review the main types of scam, suggesting that the grey economy of cryptocurrency trading is part of a wider evolution of society towards the technosocial, and beyond that perhaps towards the metaversal.	cryptocurrency;scams;fraud;financial crime;cybercrimecrime;bitcoin;spaces

1993	技术治理	Phishing Detection on Ethereum via Attributed Ego-Graph Embedding	In recent years, the losses caused by phishing scams on Ethereum have reached a level that cannot be ignored. In such a phishing detection scenario, network embedding is seen as an effective solution. In this brief, we propose an attributed ego-graph embedding framework to distinguish phishing accounts. We first obtain the account labels from an authority site and the transaction records from Ethereum on-chain blocks. Then we extract ego-graphs for each labeled account to represent it. To learn representations for ego-graphs, we utilize non-linear substructures sampled from ego-graphs and use a skip-gram model. Finally, a classifier is applied to graph embeddings to predict phishing accounts. To overcome the limit that transaction attributes are not encoded into ego-graph embeddings, we give nodes and subgraphs with richer attribute-based semantics. Specifically, we propose a novel node relabeling strategy based on Ethereum transaction attributes including transaction amount, number, and direction, and differentiating nodes and subgraphs by new labels. Through this, structural and attributed features of the Ethereum transaction networks can be learned at the same time. Experimental results show that our framework achieves effective performance on class imbalanced phishing detection on Ethereum.	phishing;blockchains;feature extraction;task analysis;data mining;smart contracts;computer crime;ethereum;blockchain;phishing;network embedding
1994	实体经济	A Clinical Kidney Intelligence Platform Based on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain Technology	The high prevalence and incidence of end-stage rental disease (ESRD) and the difficulty in the early predicting the acute kidney injury (AKI) event highlights the limits of existing kidney care model, particularly the fragmented care and fractured data. The era of medical big data and artificial intelligence (AI) opens an opportunity to fill these knowledge and practice gaps. To obtain multi-dimensional view of the profiles of patients receiving dialysis, we propose to provide coherent care services and to actively collect patients' multi-faceted information from home and hospital (e.g., photos of diets, sleep duration, or dermatologic manifestations). Furthermore, by introducing the blockchain in the infrastructure to enable the trustable medical exchange and effectively creates a large set of distributed medical data lake from various participated hospitals. We will introduce the medical coin, a virtual token, to vitalize digital service within the blockchain and create common interests among data generators, data vendors, and data users.We aim to create business models on top of its therapeutic effectiveness and unlock the academic and commercial value of medical data ecosystem.	clinical kidney intelligence platform;big data;ai;blockchain;medical data ecosystem;medical coinmirror;smart
1995	实体经济	Design of Optimal Scheduling Model for Emergency Medical Supplies by Blockchain Technology	The study aims to explore the scheduling plan for the emergency of blockchain technology in the medical industry. Network security architecture for medical supplies management based on the Hyperledger Fabric optimized consensus mechanism is established by studying the characteristics of blockchain technology and its data structure composition. The supply chain model for medical device scheduling based on intelligent contracts is selected for the particularity of the nature and shape of medical devices in medical supplies. Ant colony algorithm is used to solve it. Case analysis and verification results show that the improved Hyperledger Fabric consensus mechanism has better security performance. Under the condition of 10,000 transactions, the probability of an attacker with the optimized consensus mechanism successfully controlling the transaction is only 7.2%. The optimized solution is about 50% higher than the original solution in terms of transaction processing speed. Over 1000 transactions, the transaction latency optimization rate is more than doubled. The total order completion time of the medical device scheduling model adopted by the intelligent contract is 26.3% higher than the historical service time of 19 days. The performance of the medical emergency material scheduling program that is added to the supply chain technology is better.	
1996	协同技术	Securing Digital Ledger Technologies-Enabled IoT Devices: Taxonomy, Challenges, and Solutions	With the faster maturity and stability of digitization, connectivity and edge technologies, the number of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensors is flourishing fast in important junctions such as homes, hotels, hospitals, retail stores, manufacturing floors, railway stations, airports, oil wells, warehouses, etc. However, in this extremely connected world, the security implications for IoT devices are getting worse with the constant rise in malicious cyberattacks. The challenge is how to secure IoT sensors, services and data. The blockchain technology, a prominent distributed ledger technology (DLT), is being pronounced as the way forward for safeguarding IoT devices and data. The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based DLT has the inherent potential to realize the benefits of blockchain with better performance. IOTA is a DAG-based blockchain implementation for the IoT era. The Tangle, the IOTA's network immutably records the exchange of data and value. It ensures that the information is trustworthy and cannot be tampered with nor destroyed. In this work, we depict a thorough analysis of the existing security studies for IOTA. Then, we identify the gaps and the limitations of these security solution schemes, and finally, propose future security research recommendations that can potentially fill these gaps to secure DLT-enabled IoT devices.	security;blockchains;peer-to-peer computing;distributed ledger;internet of things;computer architecture;wireless sensor networks;blockchain;decentralized;the iot;iota;direct acyclic graph (dag);tangle;cybersecurity;privacy;confidentialitythings security;blockchain;internet;privacy
1997	协同技术	A blockchain security scheme to support fog-based internet of things	This paper proposes a fog-based secure data sharing framework for IoT devices that uses blockchain mechanism for this purpose. Fog computation is a popular paradigm that facilitates computation/storage facilities closer to the users and placed in between cloud environment and the users. Here, the IoT devices share data among each other through a secure mechanism. We propose two software agents: Software agent for Network formation and Monitoring (SAN) and Software agent for Blockchain formation and monitoring (SAB) placed in the fog node where SAN forms/monitors the network of IoT devices and SAB implements the security framework for block chain implementation. Here, three different versions of AES (128/192/256) are used for group key sharing. Group key is used for encryption/decryption of the data present in a block of a blockchain. An AES 128 based Proof of Work (PoW) is used for block addition by an authorized IoT device. SHA 256 is used for implementing hashing in blockchain. Three different systems namely System 1, 2, and 3 are considered for the experiment under different settings of design parameters. A comparison between different settings is depicted in the result section. The execution time (in seconds) is used as an evaluation parameter. The performance is found to be best in case of System 3 configuration. The time requirement is found to be a monotonically increasing function of block size and AES key length.	blockchain;iot;fog;aes;group key;sha 256

By analyzing high-frequency market microstructure observables with different information-theoretic measures for dynamical systems, we find temporal changes in information sharing across markets. In particular, we study time-varying components of predictability, memory, and (a)synchronous coupling, measured by transfer entropy, active information storage, and multi-information. By comparing these empirical findings with several models, we argue that some results could relate to intra-market and inter-market regime shifts and changes in the direction of information flow between different market observables.

1999	市场治理	The impact of news media on Bitcoin prices: modelling data driven discourses in the crypto-economy with natural language processing	This paper examines the relationship between events reported in international news via categorical discourses and Bitcoin price. Natural language processing was adopted in this study to model data-driven discourses in the crypto-economy, specifically the Bitcoin market. Using topic modelling, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a text analysis of cryptocurrency articles (N = 4218) published from 60 countries in international news media identified key topics associated with cryptocurrency in the international news media from 2018 to 2020. This study provides empirical evidence that across the corpora of international news articles, 18 key topics were framed around the following categorical macro discourses: crypto-related crime, financial governance, and economy and markets. Analysis shows that the identified discourses may have had a 'social signal' effect on movements in the crypto-financial markets, particularly on Bitcoin's price volatility. Results show these specific discourses proved to have a negative effect on Bitcoin's market price, within 24 h of when the crypto news articles were published. Further, the study found that in some cases, the source of the news may have amplified the volatility effect, particularly in terms of geographical region, relative to broader market conditions.	cryptocurrency;topic modelling;latent dirichlet allocation;news media;text analysis;sentimentsentiment
2000	市场治理	Discovering Message Templates on Large Scale Bitcoin Abuse Reports Using a Two-Fold NLP-Based Clustering Method	Bitcoin is currently a hot issue worldwide, and it is expected to become a new legal tender that replaces the current currency started with El Salvador. Due to the nature of cryptocurrency, however, difficulties in tracking led to the arising of misuses and abuses. Consequently, the pain of innocent victims by exploiting these bitcoins abuse is also increasing. We propose a way to detect new signatures by applying two-fold NLP-based clustering techniques to text data of Bitcoin abuse reports received from actual victims. By clustering the reports of text data, we were able to cluster the message templates as the same campaigns. The new approach using the abuse massage template representing clustering as a signature for identifying abusers is much efficacious.	bitcoin abuse;text clustering;text template campaign
2001	协同技术	Blockchain-Integrated Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Securing Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control	Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are an emerging solution to the issues of safe and sustainable transportation systems in the future. One major transport technology for CAVs is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), for which unsignalized autonomous intersection crossing is a growing use case. CACC relies heavily on inter-vehicular communication and is thus vulnerable to message forgery and jamming attacks. Most solutions for CACC focus exclusively on enhancing efficiency or security but do not offer an integrated framework for achieving both on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-integrated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (Block-MADRL) architecture for enhancing the efficiency of CACC while cooperatively detecting attacks, reducing the fuel efficiency of identified attackers and securely notifying the overall network. Our approach uses multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to find fuel and throughput optimizing solutions for CACC and a cooperative verification mechanism based on Extended Isolation Forest (EIF) for attack detection. Attacker data is securely stored in a Road Side Unit (RSU) level blockchain, and we design a low-latency, high throughput consensus protocol for speedy and secure data dissemination. Simulation results indicate over 29.5% better lane throughput with our approach during acceleration forgery attack, up to 23% induced reduction in fuel efficiency of malicious vehicles, 17.6% higher blockchain throughput through our consensus protocol and over 8% improvement in attack detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art.	hidden markov models;fuels;throughput;reinforcement learning;forgery;fault tolerant systems;fault tolerance;connected and autonomous vehicles;cooperative adaptive cruise control;zyzzyva;blockchain;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
2002	实体经济	Consortium Blockchain-Based Computation Offloading Using Mobile Edge Platoon Cloud in Internet of Vehicles	The rapid advancement of intelligent vehicles is deemed crucial to the emergence of diverse compute-intensive applications of assisted driving, which consist of automatic driving, speed recognition, hybrid sensing data fusion, etc. Nevertheless, resources-constraint vehicles with high mobility cannot always meet the computing and communication demands when the above applications occur. Additionally, considering the expensive and inflexible deployment of edge servers, offloading application tasks to ``Edge'' in the vehicular networks is not always working well. To effectively mitigate the above issues, the complicated application tasks are motivated to offload to the vehicle platoon, where the vehicles travel synchronously in a string with small headway. Benefiting from the stable connectivity, adjustable mobility, and reasonable charge, the task vehicle would like to process the task by leveraging the idle resources of each platoon member (PM). To make more effective use of the resources on the mobile edge platoon cloud (MEPC), we investigate the resource allocation strategy based on the task vehicle's service pricing strategy in this work. We first formulate the interactions between MEPC and task vehicle as a Stackelberg game to study the joint utility maximization of the MEPC and task vehicle. Then the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) for the proposed game is characterized and proved. The proposed algorithm Hook-Jeeves-based Stackelberg game (HJSG) can reach the SE. Finally, we introduce the consortium blockchain to ensure the security and privacy of service transactions. The entire system helps enhance task processing efficiency, protect transaction data, and improve service experience. Experimental results over numerical simulation based on practical scenarios demonstrate that compared with Multi-round Stackelberg Game (MRSG), uniform pricing, and the local computation strategy, the proposed HJSG algorithm can attain less execution time and faster convergence performance.	task analysis;games;cloud computing;voting;blockchains;delays;resource management;internet of vehicle;computation offloading;mobile edge platoon cloud (mepc);stackelberg game;consortium blockchain
2003	核心技术	A Blockchain-Based Location Privacy-Preserving Scheme in Location-Based Service	With the rapid popularization and development of location-based services (LBS), location privacy preserving has become a mainstream concern. Existing anonymity-based methods rely mainly on anonymous location selection based on geographic information, which neglects the semantic information on the location, and behavior of self-interested users may raise a privacy vulnerability. A blockchain-based approach for location privacy protection schemes has been proposed to address these issues. In this scheme, the privacy level of the location is improved using private chain-based collaborative anonymous communication with anonymous set construction methods that consider the semantic diversity associated with the related user. Compared with other existing methods, evaluation based on real-world datasets shows that the proposed method prevents location privacy leakage from collaborative users and constructs a semantical anonymity set, thus effectively protecting the user's location privacy.	protection
2004	核心技术	Multi-Leader Multi-Follower Stackelberg Game in Mobile Blockchain Mining	The development of Blockchain-based mobile applications are impeded due to the resource limitations of mobile devices. Computation offloading can be a viable solution. In this paper, we consider a two-layer computation offloading paradigm including an edge computing service provider (ESP) and a cloud computing service provider (CSP). We formulate a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game to address the computing resource management problem in such a network, by jointly maximizing the profits of each service provider (SP) and the payoffs of individual miners. We study two practical scenarios: a fixed-miner-number scenario for permissioned blockchains and a dynamic-miner-number scenario for permissionless blockchains. For the fixed-miner-number scenario, we discuss two different edge operation modes, i.e., the ESP is connected (to the CSP) or standalone, which form different miner subgames based on whether each miner's strategy set is mutually dependent. The existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in both modes are analyzed, according to which algorithms are proposed to achieve the corresponding SE(s). For the dynamic-miner-number scenario, we focus on the impact of population uncertainty and find that the uncertainty inflates the aggressiveness in the ESP resource purchasing. Numerical evaluations are presented to verify the proposed models.	blockchain;games;delays;edge computing;cloud computing;computational modeling;mobile computing;cloud computing;edge computing;game theory;load sharing;mobile blockchain mining;reinforcement learning
2005	核心技术	A Novel Consensus Algorithm Based on Segmented DAG and BP Neural Network for Consortium Blockchain	Currently, because of the excellent properties of decentralization, hard tamperability, and traceability, blockchain is widely used in WSN and IoT applications. In particular, consortium blockchain plays a fundamental role in the practical application environment, but consensus algorithm is always a key constraint. Over the past decade, we have been witnessing the obvious growth in blockchain consensus algorithms. However, in the existing consortium blockchain consensus algorithms, there is a limited characteristic of scalability, concurrency, and security. To address this problem, this work introduces a new consensus algorithm that is derived from a directed acyclic graph and backpropagation neural network. First, we propose a partitioned structure and segmented directed acyclic graph as data storage structure, which allows us to improve scalability, throughput, and fine-grained granularity of transaction data. Furthermore, in order to provide the accuracy of node credit evaluation and reduce the possibility of Byzantine nodes, we introduce a novel credit evaluation mechanism based on a backpropagation neural network. Finally, we design a resistant double-spending mechanism based on MapReduce, which ensures the transaction data are globally unique and ordered. Experimental results and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has advantages in throughput. Compared with the existing methods, it has higher security and scalability.	
2006	实体经济	Scrutinizing blockchain applicability in sustainable supply chains through an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision making framework	Sustainability has become increasingly important over the last three decades and has proven to be a key enabler for constructing resilient supply chains. Customers who want their products to be authenticated for sustainability put pressure on Original Equipment Manufacturers and suppliers to become more sustainable on a global scale. Moreover, social sustainability issues have become more challenging to address, and a growing number of stakeholders put emphasis on societal concerns. To this end, decision-makers are becoming increasingly interested in applying disruptive technologies to address societal, environmental, and economic concerns and accomplish sustainability goals. Researchers argue that disruptive technologies such as blockchain may be implemented to assist supply chains towards building sustainability. However, our literature analysis concluded that existing research has not quantitatively examined the critical functions of sustainable supply chain (SSC) for blockchain applicability using a decision framework. Therefore, this research, through Fuzzy SWARA-COPRAS-EDAS and COPELAND-based framework, is aimed at investigating the most feasible functions of a SSC for potential blockchain implementations. Using this framework, the critical functions of a SSC were ranked against the benefits of blockchain. The findings of this study implied that while sourcing, delivery, transformation and product recovery proved to be the most appropriate functions of SSCs for blockchain applications, customers and product use was the least feasible one. This study aids decision-makers in gaining a more thorough understanding of where in a SSC blockchain may create additional value.

2007	实体经济	PPO2: Location Privacy-Oriented Task Offloading to Edge Computing Using Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Autonomous Transport Systems	AI-empowered 5G/6G networks play a substantial role in taking full advantage of the Internet of Things (IoT) to perform complex computing by offloading tasks to edge services deployed in intelligent transport systems. However, offloading behavior has a certain regularity, and the real-time location of users can easily be inferred by attackers who have historical user data during the data transmission process. To address this problem, a privacy-oriented task offloading method that can resist attacks from privacy attackers with prior knowledge is proposed. First, the local computing model, channel model, and privacy loss model are defined and used to quantify evaluation indicators, such those related to privacy, time, and energy. Among them, privacy loss is formalized as the probability of a successful attack by an attacker with prior knowledge. Second, the process of solving an optimal task offloading decision problem is formalized into a Markov decision process (MDP). Finally, the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method PPO2 is proposed to solve the planning problem of task offloading with good generalization and convergence speed, where we focus on the location privacy requirement. Experiments show that our method can handle large-scale task offloading and obtain offloading policies with reduced privacy loss, energy consumption and time delays.	task analysis;privacy;servers;computational modeling;edge computing;data privacy;real-time systems;location privacy;data transmission and tasking offloading;deep reinforcement learning;iov edge computing;privacy lossbig data;iot;internet;blockchain;security;mobility
2008	实体经济	Recovery strategies for a disrupted supply chain network: Leveraging blockchain technology in pre- and post-disruption scenarios	Supply chain networks have become larger, more complex and more challenging to manage, especially considering the multitude of risks and disruptions that may manifest. As such, a disruption can wreak havoc to a supply chain network, rendering the ability of a firm to respond to these disruptions with appropriate recovery strategies paramount. In this paper, we analyze such recovery strategies in a supply chain network. The specific model we develop aims at predicting a disruption that may occur in a context where smart contracts have been implemented based on blockchain technology. Within this setting, we suggest appropriate measures to be un-dertaken by an organization to mitigate the disruption and avoid negative performance outcomes as much as possible. If the disruption cannot be avoided, the proposed genetic algorithm-based approach focuses on adopting re-active measures to manage the post-disruption reality. As such, we effectively integrate both pre-and post-disruption scenarios to offer wholistic decision-support in an integrated fashion, extending prior work which mostly developed guidance only for either pre-or post-disruption responses. Specifically, we study the perfor-mance of a complex multi-echelon supply chain network, involving multiple suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors, under various conditions. The insights derived discern the effect of mitigation measures during a disruption, offering valuable guidance for decision makers.	supply chain management;disruptions;performance;blockchain;genetic algorithm;robustnesssupport vector regression;genetic algorithm;multiobjective optimization;risk propagation;resilience;mitigation;management
2009	实体经济	Timing of blockchain adoption in a supply chain with competing manufacturers	Recent improvements in consumers' awareness of product traceability have revealed the disadvantages of traditional supply chain traceability systems. Traditional traceability systems are centralized, and the data that they use are vulnerable to tampering, resulting in a low level of consumer trust. Blockchain technology, as a distributed ledger, can solve these problems. In this study, we examine the blockchain technology introduction decisions of a supply chain involving two competing manufacturers and a single retailer, and their effects on supply chain performance. We find that manufacturers should adopt blockchain technology only when consumer sensitivity to blockchain technology exceeds a certain level and manufacturers who can introduce blockchain technology first are more likely to reap big gains in profits. Regarding the unit verification fee that the retailer pays to the manufacturer when introducing blockchain technology, the manufacturer subsidizes this fee to the retailer in the form of lower wholesale prices. In other words, there is no additional wholesale cost to the retailer for blockchain technology-based products. The results of this study provide guidance for supply chain members' market practices.	supply chain management;manufacturer competition;blockchain technology;consumer traceability awarenessstructure design;traceability;products;channel;technology;choice

Account classification can help us detect illegal behavior, track transactions, and de-anonymize the Ethereum transaction system. In this brief, we make use of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to solve the account classification problem in Ethereum. We model the Ethereum transaction records as a large-scale transaction network and find that the network is with high heterophily, in which accounts with different features and different labels are connected. In order to solve this problem, we propose a GCN-based model called EH-GCN. The experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset show that the proposed method achieves the most advanced classification performance, and results on benchmarks show it produces a competitive performance under homophily.	bitcoin;benchmark testing;task analysis;circuits and systems;business;blockchains;feature extraction;blockchain;ethereum;graph convolutional network;heterophily;account classification
2011	法律治理	Reconceptualising the Nautical Fault Exception in the Fog of Emerging Technologies	It is expected that the maritime world will be significantly different by 2050, from smart ports through to blockchain-based shipping documents and autonomous vessels. As the maritime trade witnesses further developments in this field, there will be an inevitable struggle to harmonise the new technology vessels with the traditional rules of law. This article seeks to further the discussion of one of the main legal rules that will have a significant role in shaping sea carriers' liability for goods carried by autonomous vessels: the nautical fault exception, which operates to remove, to some extent, sea carriers' liability for losses arising from the acts or omissions of their employees. The main tenet of this article is that an adapted version of the exception should be available to govern the carriage of goods by new technology vessels. In this context, it advocates the use of legal personhood for the purposes of the nautical fault exception. In so doing, this article contributes to the important debate in employment law on the distribution of the risk of losses arising from autonomous systems when, in future, they take over tasks traditionally carried out by employees. In the absence of employment contracts to perform certain commercial activities, the law will need to decide whether legal personhood should be assigned to autonomous systems for efficient and fair risk allocation. This article illustrates why this may be the solution particularly where there is a 'fine-tuned' balance of liability already struck in the current legal landscape.

The anesthetic dose of propofol during operation in the control group is determined according to general information and personal situation. The team uses blockchain to process the patient's clinical data and general information to calculate the optimal dose of propofol. The changes of hemodynamic indexes of patients in the two groups are compared, including dural incision (T1), 1 h after craniotomy (T2), end of surgery (T3), and 6 h after surgery (T4). The changes of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and central neuron-specific protein (S100 beta) at T1, T2, T3, and T4 in 2 groups are observed and recorded. The changes of malondialdehyde (MDA) at T1, T2, T3, and T4 are compared between the two groups. Based on the analysis of clinical data and general information of patients on blockchain, the optimal intraoperative anesthetic dose of propofol for patients can effectively protect the brain function of patients, and the intraoperative anesthesia state is relatively stable, and the changes and improvements of intraoperative indicators are good.

We study how introducing a central bank digital currency affects equilibrium allocations and welfare in an environment where both currency and bank deposits are used in exchange. We highlight an important policy tradeoff: while a digital currency tends to improve efficiency in exchange, it may also crowd out bank deposits, raise banks' funding costs, and decrease investment. We derive conditions under which targeted digital currencies, which compete only with physical currency or only with bank deposits, raise welfare. If such targeted currencies are infeasible, we illustrate the policy tradeoffs that arise when issuing a single, universal digital currency.	digital currency;public vs;private money;liquidity premium;monetary policy;disintermediation;e42;e58;g28liquidity;private;policy;money

2015	市场治理	Grey Verhulst model and its chaotic behaviour with application to Bitcoin adoption	The study applies the grey model (GM(1,1)) to the Verhulst differential equation for forecasting the Bitcoin transaction counts. The grey Verhulst model (GVM) is based on the data set of Bitcoin as recorded along 10 years from the 1st August 2010. The model accuracy is checked by the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), while the model predictability is assessed by analysing a plot of the Verhulst model constructed upon the parameters provided by the GVM. The MAPE criterion suggests the reasonable accuracy of the overall GVM forecasting values and high accuracy by considering the last 400 forecasting values. Furthermore, the Verhulst model plot suggests that the GVM is potential on predictability as the plot is not chaotic. The GVM forecasting values suggest a slight future decline in transacting Bitcoin; this may be due to its competition with the other emerging cryptocurrencies. The GVM suggests a relatively high performance as compared to the usual one-variable forecasting model GM(1,1).	grey model;mean absolute percentage error;continuous time model;discrete time model;malthus model;verhulst modelcryptocurrencies
2016	市场治理	Robust estimation of time-dependent precision matrix with application to the cryptocurrency market	Most financial signals show time dependency that, combined with noisy and extreme events, poses serious problems in the parameter estimations of statistical models. Moreover, when addressing asset pricing, portfolio selection, and investment strategies, accurate estimates of the relationship among assets are as necessary as are delicate in a time-dependent context. In this regard, fundamental tools that increasingly attract research interests are precision matrix and graphical models, which are able to obtain insights into the joint evolution of financial quantities. In this paper, we present a robust divergence estimator for a time-varying precision matrix that can manage both the extreme events and time-dependency that affect financial time series. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to handle parameter estimations that uses the "maximization-minimization" approach. We apply the methodology to synthetic data to test its performances. Then, we consider the cryptocurrency market as a real data application, given its remarkable suitability for the proposed method because of its volatile and unregulated nature.	time-varying models;robust methods;kernel estimation;precision matrix;divergencestylized facts;bitcoin;volatility
2017	市场治理	The social side of cryptocurrency: Exploring the investors' ideological realities from Romanian Facebook groups	The complexity of blockchain technologies is reflected in the various ways in which social actors operate with crypto transactions, and this is seen in the wide range of discourses and practices adopted on the crypto market. Using social constructivism, this study highlights the fact that social practices in the crypto area respect certain thematic ideologies, through which individual discourses reflect different pragmatic expectations in relation to virtually encrypted transactions. Drawing on inductive thematic analysis based on 38 semi-structured interviews with Romanian investors, four major themes emerge: (1) unbreakable power of code encompasses rather libertarian discourses on potential state policies, (2) key role of peers explains the investments in the crypto market as a form of community membership, (3) assuming plenty of risks highlights the discourses focused on substantial and unpredictable gains, and (4) preferring safety above all encompasses discourses on financial stability through rather conservative behaviors.	code;crypto market;exploratory research;ideologies;legitimacy;social constructivism;thematic analysisblockchain;confidence;trust;power
2018	实体经济	EdgeShare: A blockchain-based edge data-sharing framework for Industrial Internet of Things	Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges in sharing mas-sive device data across heterogeneous network domains. Traditional cloud-based sharing solutions for IIoT applications that are getting closer to devices are uneconomical and inefficient because of their cen-tralized architecture. We propose a blockchain-based data-sharing framework called EdgeShare for edge data-sharing services among heterogeneous network domains by introducing a two-layer overlay net -work topology and an edge computing paradigm that can dramatically alleviate system pressure and reduce communication delays to improve data-sharing efficiency. Under such framework, a novel smart contract is designed to construct access control strategies with dissimilar granularities to achieve differ-ent levels of data access control in an undeniable and automated manner. All IIoT data-sharing activities are recorded in a blockchain for secured transaction logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeShare prototype and conduct extensive experiments and analyses to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals. In contrast with centralized sharing methods, results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effec-tively improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of massive data sharing while introducing reason-able and acceptable overheads.

2019	实体经济	A Self-Tallying Electronic Voting Based on Blockchain (Sep, 10.1093/comjnl/bxab123, 2021)	Electronic voting (e-voting) has been studied for many years. Recently, researchers find that blockchain can provide an alternative secure platform for e-voting systems, because of its properties of tamper resistance and transparency. However, existing blockchain-based schemes either require central authorities to tally ballots or can only handle a limited number of voters. This paper tries to propose a self-tallying e-voting system, i.e. the public can verify the validity of all ballots and tally the ballots without a centralized authority. To achieve this goal, we solve two challenges, namely how to cancel out all random numbers used for ballots and to prove the validity of ballots using a non-interactive zero knowledge proof. Our scheme is proved to be secure and shown to be practical by experiments.	
2020	实体经济	Blockchain Enabled Credibility Applications: Extant Issues, Frameworks and Cases	The credibility of information is known as a major cause of a wide range of issues, such as: altered product information in food supply chains; fake transactions on E-commerce platforms; lengthy claim settlement time in agricultural insurance; and costly borrowings in agricultural financing. For a more specific example in food supply chains, end customers want to check the product information, but either doubt the authenticity of information, or simply do not have access to the information. The reason is that upstream suppliers and downstream retailers are often reluctant to share data, fearing privacy loss or business secret leakage. The consequence is that regulatory departments may face enormous challenges to identify accurate contamination sources, if there is scarce information or falsely recorded information at any stage of the food supply chain. In this paper, we focus on four common scenarios demanding information credibility in the agricultural supply chain: product traceability, E-commerce platforms, agricultural insurance, and agricultural financing. We review some high-profile smart credibility applications with emphasis on how blockchain related technologies can provide the information credibility by examining extant issues and relevant frameworks.	blockchains;supply chains;pipelines;electronic commerce;smart contracts;data privacy;business;blockchain;information credibility;supply chainsupply chain

On the other hand, P2P trading is expected to give multiple benefits to the grid in minimizing the peak load demand, energy consumption costs, and eliminating network losses. However, installing P2P energy trading on a broader level in electrical-based networks presents a number of modeling problems in physical and virtual network layers. As a result, this article presents a thorough examination of P2P studies of energy trade literature. An overview is given with the essential characteristics of P2P energy trading and comparatively analyzed with multiple advantages for the utility grid and individual prosumers. The study then addresses the physical and virtual levels that systematically categorize the available research. Furthermore, the technological techniques have been gone through multiple problems that need to overcome for P2P energy trading in electrical networks. Finally, the article concludes with suggestions for further research.	p2p energy trading;physical and virtual layers;game theory;energy management;auction theory;storage;energy market;network lossrenewable energy;university campus;demand response;technoeconomic analysis;management-system;storage system;virtual power;peer;market;pv
2022	实体经济	Blockchained education: challenging the long-standing model of academic institutions	The model of higher education institutions has remained widely unchallenged over time. Although study topics keep evolving and the inclusion of increasingly sophisticated technologies have revolutionised the format of lectures and learning experiences. Their value chain remains unchanged, with institutions acting as intermediaries, between professors (knowledge) and students (recipients), and as central authorities granting and validating student knowledge. The work here presented is a review of blockchain technology and its application in education, emphasising the opportunities for disrupting the current value chain of academic institutions. Blockchain technology's prime novelty constitutes an incorruptible digital ledger of transactions, capable of recording virtually any nature of value exchange. When coupled with other emerging technologies such as the internet of things and big data, new paths for the decentralised exchange of education and recording of knowledge and skills appear. The result is an extensive analysis of the evolution of blockchain technology for education applications, along with a forecast of plausible scenarios of disruption for academic institutions. Blockchain technology is steadily advancing at accelerating rates; applications aimed at decentralising educational institutions are already available. Meanwhile, the technology keeps gaining momentum in a growing base of adepts.	blockchain;higher education;access to information;educational innovation;experiential learning;futures
2023	实体经济	Behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation in agrifood supply chain management: A thematic analysis	Despite its perceived utility, several companies and managers continue to hold reservations about blockchain implementation in supply chain management. To elucidate the causes, we examine the behavioural and organisational antecedents that influence the adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management. To do this, we undertake thematic analysis on blockchain-related agri-food business news and expert opinions from the Ovid database's Agricola section. Four themes are central to our model: organisational adoption strategies, technical advantages, environmental obstacles, and implementation intention. Using these themes, we build a thematic map and derive three propositions about the role of behavioural antecedents to blockchain implementation intention in supply chains, thus substantiating Behavioural Reasoning Theory (BRT) and Technology Organisation and Environment (TOE) theory's core arguments. Our findings elucidate novel factors influencing blockchain adoption in supply chains. More specifically, we show that managers who consider the technological benefits associated with blockchain capacity are able to provide stakeholders with new opportunities and embrace adoption strategies such as product launch and partnership formation while also considering environmental and contextual barriers such as market fragmentation, scarcity of research, and regulatory restrictions.	agri-food sector;behaviour;blockchain;supply chain management;partnershipsadoption;challenges

2025	虚拟经济	Digital future of luxury brands: Metaverse, digital fashion, and non-fungible tokens	Leading luxury brands have incorporated technologies to recreate brand images and reinvent consumer experience. The fashion industry is experiencing a historic transformation thanks to emerging technologies such as blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) along with impactful technologies such as artificial intelligence (Al), machine learning (ML), and virtual reality (VR). With metaverse as a new social platform around the corner, academics and industry alike are querying how these new technologies might reshape luxury brands, reinvent consumer experience, and alter consumer behavior. This research charts new academic territory by investigating how newly evolved technologies affect the fashion industry. With practical examples of luxury brands, this article has theorized the irreversible trend of digital fashion: the attraction of NFT collectibles. It then proposes intriguing questions for scholars and practitioners to ponder, such as will young consumers, essentially living online, buy more fashion products in the digital world than in the real world? How can the fashion industry strategize for the coexistence of digital collections and physical goods?	
2026	市场治理	Are clean energy and carbon emission allowances caused by bitcoin? A novel time-varying method	The bitcoin market has substantially grown in recent years. The researchers are exploring its various repercussions for socioeconomic and political matters; however, the literature still lacks clear evidence on how bitcoin interacts with energy and the environment. This study aims to explore the causal relationship between bitcoin, clean energy, and carbon emissions allowances by applying the novel time-varying Granger causality test on the daily data spanning from Sept 17, 2014, to October 12, 2021. The empirical findings confirm that both clean energy and emission allowances are causally associated with bitcoin. However, this causal relationship varies over time and the duration of causality is longer as suggested by the recursive evolving procedure. The outcome is robust when bitcoin is measured by the volume and the price. Furthermore, the results obtained from robustness analysis conducted through heteroskedastic consistent test also validate the findings that bitcoin causes clean energy and carbon allowance. The findings offer a platform for government officials and policy managers to improve clean energy and carbon allowance markets for sustainable development by managing and using the tools to control and regulate cryptocurrency markets.	bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;carbon allowances;clean energyrenewable energy;unit-root;consumption;cryptocurrencies

This dataset serves academics for deeper analysis of these topics as well as it gives relevant information for spotting and evaluating risks in the market. Moreover, practitioners can benefit from the dataset and use it to identify patterns in the market, discover potential earning capabilities, and create effective arbitrage trading strategies. This is the first publicly available dataset that provides unique arbitrage data about pairs of cryptocurrency exchanges. The raw dataset was received by the Bitlocus LT, UAB. Using dplyr, reshape2, plyr packages in R we transformed dataset to show the amount of arbitrage which could be earned in 13 different cryptocurrency exchanges from 2019-01-01 to 2020-04-01. We used this dataset to create matrices for each day from 2019-01-01 to 2020-04-01 in order to perform network analysis on Bitcoin arbitrage opportunities (Bruzge and Sapkauskiene [1]). However, this dataset is beneficial for other purposes such as the evaluation of market's seasonality and day of week effects.

2029	市场治理	Bitcoin price change and trend prediction through twitter sentiment and data volume	Twitter sentiment has been shown to be useful in predicting whether Bitcoin's price will increase or decrease. Yet the state-of-the-art is limited to predicting the price direction and not the magnitude of increase/decrease. In this paper, we seek to build on the state-of-the-art to not only predict the direction yet to also predict the magnitude of increase/decrease. We utilise not only sentiment extracted from tweets, but also the volume of tweets. We present results from experiments exploring the relation between sentiment and future price at different temporal granularities, with the goal of discovering the optimal time interval at which the sentiment expressed becomes a reliable indicator of price change. Two different neural network models are explored and evaluated, one based on recurrent nets and one based on convolutional networks. An additional model is presented to predict the magnitude of change, which is framed as a multi-class classification problem. It is shown that this model yields more reliable predictions when used alongside a price trend prediction model. The main research contribution from this paper is that we demonstrate that not only can price direction prediction be made but the magnitude in price change can be predicted with relative accuracy ( 63%).	bitcoin;sentiment analysis;prediction methods;cryptocurrencies

Yet, both the academic and practitioner literature omits discussion of any policy-level analysis of the interaction between procurement rules and FinTech innovations. Procurement authorities and procurement law can play a vital role in the development of FinTech. They can help build the FinTech platforms and ecosystems that help them engage in public procurement.

2032	核心技术	First Smart Contract Allowing Cryptoasset Recovery	Cryptoassets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are widely traded around the world. Cryptocurrencies are also transferred between investors. Cryptocurrency has become a new and attractive means of remittance. Thus, blockchain-based smart contracts also attract attention when central banks design digital currencies. However, it has been discovered that a significant amount of cryptoassets on blockchain are lost or stranded for a variety of reasons, including the loss of the private key or the owner's death. To address this issue, we propose a method for recoverable transactions that would replace the traditional transaction by allowing cryptoassets to be sent to a backup account address after a deadline has passed. We provide the computational workload required for our method by analyzing the prototype. The method proposed in this paper can be considered as a good model for digital currency design, including central bank digital currency (CBDC).	blockchain;central bank digital currency (cbdc);cryptoasset;distributed ledger technology (dlt);smart contractblockchain

The watermarking techniques have been used to authenticate the owner and protect the EMR from illegal copying. The existing distributive strategies, successfully operated to secure the EMR, are found to be inadequate. Blockchain technology, mainly, is employed by a sharing database that allows the digital crypto-currency. It rapidly leads to the magnified expectations acme. In this excitement, the use of consortium adopting the technology based on Blockchain, in the EMR structure, is found improving. This type of consortium adds an immutable share with a translucent record of the entire business and it is accomplished with responsibility, along with faith and transparency. The combination of watermarking and Blockchain technology provides a singular chance to promote a secured, trustworthy electronic documents administration to share with the e-records system. The authors, in this article, present their views on consortium Blockchain technology which is incorporated in the EMR system.

2034	协同技术	Advanced digital signatures for preserving privacy and trust management in hierarchical heterogeneous IoT: Taxonomy, capabilities, and objectives	Internet of Things (IoT) systems in different areas, such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare, are the convergence of several technologies. There are many concerns about security and privacy drawbacks in IoT systems. Apart from confidentiality supported by encryption primitives, authenticity and non-repudiation are of utmost importance. IoT entities generally use conventional digital signature schemes to achieve imperative goals. However, there are some state-of-the-art digital signatures with more functionalities, IoT-friendly properties, and privacy-preserving features. This survey paper aims to accelerate the adoption of advanced digital signatures. We bridge the gap between the advanced theoretical digital signatures recently designed in cryptographic-oriented papers and the applied IoT systems. It aids researchers in achieving more security, privacy as well as some unique functionality aspects. First, we illustrate the benefits of the hierarchical and heterogeneous IoT architecture supporting the end-edge-fog-cloud continuum accompanying blockchain technology. Second, our survey delves into five state-of-the-art digital signatures, including randomizable, keyless, double-authentication-prevention, sanitizable, and redactable schemes, that are aligned with entities in IoT systems. We provide an outline, taxonomy, comparison table, and diverse IoT-based use cases for each of them. Then, the integration of primitives and the relationship diagrams give guidelines to help select the appropriate advanced digital signatures and highlights how researchers can use them with different IoT entities for preserving privacy and management of trust.	digital signature;iot;privacy-preserving;blockchain;cloud computingsecurity architecture;industrial internet;blockchain;things;edge;authentication;efficient;strategy;scheme;services
2035	市场治理	On the dynamic return and volatility connectedness of cryptocurrency, crude oil, clean energy, and stock markets: a time-varying analysis	The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency transactions has raised concerns about the environment and sustainability among green investors and regulatory authorities. The current study examines the connectedness among clean energy, Bitcoin, the stock market, and crude oil empirically. The time-varying parameter vector autoregression (TVP-VAR) is used to estimate the dynamics of connectedness in a daily dataset spanning the period November 11, 2013 to September 30, 2021. We find that the clean energy and traditional stock markets transmit shocks to Bitcoin and oil in terms of return, and they receive shocks in terms of volatility from Bitcoin and oil. Additionally, Bitcoin and other financial markets are only tenuously linked during non-crisis periods. Nonetheless, their connection strengthens substantially during times of crisis, such as the great cryptocurrency crash of 2018 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. We believe that these findings can help explain how clean energy and cryptocurrency markets are linked during times of crisis.	cryptocurrency;bitcoin;clean energy;tvp-var;dynamic connectedness;realized volatilityimpulse-response analysis;bitcoin;spillovers;carbon

This paper aims at providing non-iterative and scalable decentralized energy management for multi-integrated natural gas electricity systems with uncertain wind power. An operation space projection transformation method is proposed to reformulate the electricity and natural gas system operation problems for constructing equivalent feasible operation space with the optimality information contained. Accordingly, the proposed decentralized management is privacy-preserving, low-complex, and globally optimal. Moreover, the mathematical proof of the optimality of the reformulated problem is provided. In addition to privacy protection, trust issues are taken into account. Blockchain is applied to safeguard the proposed decentralized management against potential malicious behaviours. We introduce how the proposed decentralized management is embedded in the consensus process of the blockchain. The potential of the projection transformation method in the digital twin application is analyzed. Numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized energy management method. The synergistic effect and robustness of the proposed operation model are embodied, while the computational accuracy and performance of the non-iterative solution technique are validated.	integrated energy systems;coordinated operation;digital twins;blockchain;decentralized management;operation space projection transformationenergy;power
2039	虚拟经济	Do news headlines matter in the cryptocurrency market?	The paper examines the influence of investor sentiment based on news headlines on the Cryptocurrency Market Index and ten individual cryptocurrency returns. We capture investors' sentiment from cryptocurrency-specific news headlines. We use a lexicon-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique to construct a unique sentiment indicator, and the sentiment scores are generated using two financial dictionaries: Henry(2008)(HE) and Loughran and Mcdonald(2011)(LM). The findings of the study show that news sentiment has a significant impact on cryptocurrency returns. When the investors' sentiment is optimistic or bullish, the cryptocurrency market experiences herding behaviour, leading to an increase in prices. The diverse and heterogeneous nature of the various cryptocurrencies causes each individual cryptocurrency to respond differently to sentiment. Further, we see that sentiment has a more pronounced impact on young, small, and volatile cryptocurrencies. Our study is among the few studies that use cryptocurrency-specific news headlines rather than news bodies to build a news sentiment indicator.

2040	实体经济	Critical success factors for implementing blockchain-based circular supply chain	The growing importance of the circular economy has emphasised optimal utilisation of resources within the constraints of economic development and protection of the environment. Digital technologies associated with Industry 4.0, such as blockchain, facilitate the implementation of circular economy principles throughout the supply chain. However, because blockchain implementation in the supply chain is still in the early stages, real-world examples of the blockchain-based circular supply chains (CSCs) are limited. The principal purpose of the paper is to examine the critical success factors (CSFs) for implementing blockchain-based CSCs. Following that, 10 CSFs are identified through a short systematic literature review, and then, the integrated fuzzy cognitive mapping and fuzzy best-worst method (FCM-FBWM) is implemented to examine CSFs for the blockchain-based CSC. The study's main findings demonstrate that network collaboration is the best CSF, while the shared circular economy toolbox is counted worst of all. This research enriches the literature by identifying the CSFs for implementing blockchain-enabled CSCs to address the lack of a suitable decision-making framework that assists managers in comprehending how blockchain technology can be adopted in the circular economy context. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed, offering new insights into the measures necessary to ensure successful blockchain implementations in CSCs.	blockchain;circular economy;circular supply chain;critical success factors;fbwm;fcmbest-worst;economy;management;waste
2041	实体经济	Integrating blockchain into supply chain safeguarded by PUF-enabled RFID	Due to globalization, supply chain networks are moving towards higher complexity and becoming vulnerable to various kinds of attacks such as counterfeiting, information tampering, and so on. Appropriate approaches are necessary to tackle different types of attacks and to ensure the required supply chain security. In this paper, we have addressed the product counterfeiting issue using Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) enabled Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag. In this research, as a preferred alternative to the traditional centralized databases, blockchain technology has been leveraged to support anti-counterfeiting. Applying blockchain technology to supply chains can add many useful features such as decentralization, immutability, transparency, traceability, non-repudiation, complicated record-keeping, and so on. We have also used a reputation-based consensus algorithm for the blockchain which is less resource-intensive and thus will not indirectly impose additional cost on supply chain products. In the same research direction, we have devised our system architecture that is suitable for lightweight supply chain devices. The proposed three protocols namely: registration protocol, verification protocol, and transaction protocol along with the blockchain technology help to transfer the ownership of the authentic product and keep the sensitive supply chain information safe. An encryption-based secret sharing technique has also been introduced to assist data protection.	blockchain;puf;rfid;secret sharing;supply chain securityinternet;device

Design/methodology/approach VOSviewer and SciMAT techniques were used for clustering and mapping the use of ETs in the public services delivery. Collecting documents from the DGRL v16.6 database, the paper uses text mining analysis for identifying key terms and trends in e-Government research regarding ETs and public services. Findings The analysis indicates that all ETs are strongly linked to each other, except for blockchain technologies (due to its disruptive nature), which indicate that ETs can be, therefore, seen as accumulative knowledge. In addition, on the whole, findings identify four stages in the evolution of ETs and their application to public services: the "electronic administration" stage, the "technological baseline" stage, the "managerial" stage and the "disruptive technological" stage. Practical implications The output of the present research will help to orient policymakers in the implementation and use of ETs, evaluating the influence of these technologies on public services. Social implications The research helps researchers to track research trends and uncover new paths on ETs and its implementation in public services. Originality/value Recent research has focused on the need of implementing ETs for improving public services, which could help cities to improve the citizens' quality of life in urban areas. This paper contributes to expanding the knowledge about ETs and its implementation in public services, identifying trends and networks in the research about these issues.	emerging technologies;public services;text mining;clustering analysis;science mappingsocial media;open government;science;future;management;evolution;citation;surgery;field

Digital twins, along with the Internet of Things, fifth-generation wireless systems, blockchain, collaborative computing, simulation, and artificial intelligence technologies, offer great potential in the transformation of the current urban governance paradigm toward smart cities. In this paper, the concept of a digital twin city (DTC) is proposed. The characteristics, key technologies, and application scenarios of a DTC are elaborated upon. Further, we discuss the theories, research directions, and framework regarding DTCs. (c) 2021 China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

2044	市场治理	COVID-19 full vaccination and blockchain size: empirical evidence from the cryptocurrency market	Purpose This paper aims to analyse COVID-19 indices and blockchain features on Bitcoin and Ethereum returns, respectively. The authors focus on the most used and owned cryptocurrencies that cover Europe, the US and Asian countries. Design/methodology/approach An autoregressive distributed lag panel (pooled mean group and mean group) is utilized, and a robustness check is incorporated by using a Random Effect Model and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Findings Four new findings were discovered, including (1) the vaccine confidence index (VCI) pushes economic recovery and increased demand for the Bitcoin market, but the opposite result was interestingly observed from Ethereum; (2) the blockchain features were revealed to be essential to Bitcoin, while they were irrelevant to Ethereum for short-run country-specific results; (3) the hash rate and network difficulty moved inversely during the pandemic; and (4) the government played a significant role in taking action during uncertain times and regarding cryptocurrency policies. Research limitations/implications VCI is constructed by the most used vaccine type in our sample countries (i.e. Pfizer), as the data for a specific classification by each type is still unavailable. Practical implications Providing an evenly distributed vaccination program primary vaccination series against COVID-19 to the citizens is an essential duty of the government. Bitcoin policymakers and investors should watch the COVID-19 vaccine distributions closely as it will affect its return. Ethereum is emphasized to keep developing its smart contract which appeared to outplay other blockchain features. Cryptocurrency investors should be wise in their investment decisions by analysing the news thoroughly. Social implications This research emphasizes that the success in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination requires citizens' willingness to participate and their trust in the vaccine's efficacy. Such self-awareness and self-discipline in society can ultimately empower individuals and stabilise the economy. Nevertheless, the implementation of health protocols is still highly required to prevent the spread of new variants of COVID-19. Originality/value This is the first study that attempts to construct a VCI which denotes the confidence derived from the administration of full-dose COVID-19 vaccines (an initial vaccine and a second vaccine). The authors further find the impact on cryptocurrency returns. Next, blockchain size is utilized as a new determinant of cryptocurrencies.	ardl panel;blockchain;covid-19;cryptocurrency;vaccine;vaccine confidence indexpanel-data;economic-growth;bitcoin;tests;specification;sentiment;openness
